The model
=========

In this section, we generalize the _contest game_ introduced by @moldovanu2001optimal to a situation where players allocate their effort along two dimensions: performance and time. Then we explore the problem of maximization faced by a contest designer with xxx preferences for performance and time.

Basic setup
------------

A (generalized) contest game is an $N$ player game with asymmetric information. Players compete by choosing a performance variable $y$ and a timing $t$, both nonnegative numbers --- to be thought of as the quality and time to completion of a job. Players move simultaneously to maximize the probability of winning one of $K$ available prizes while minimizing the cost of effort. Prizes are of decreasing value $V_1>V_2>...>V_K$.

Let $a_1, ..., a_N$ denote a privately observed individual ability of players drawn from a common distribution $F_{\mathcal{A}}$ on a given interval $\mathcal{A}$.  Let $C(a_i, y_i, t_i)$ denote player $i$'s cost function and assume it is multiplicative 
\begin{equation}
  C(a_i, y_i, t_i) = c_a(a_i) c_y(y_i) c_t(t_i)
\end{equation}
with $c_a(\cdot)$ and $c_t(\cdot)$ both monotonic decreasing (the higher the ability or the time to complete, the lower the cost). Whereas $c_{y}(\cdot)$ is monotonic increasing (the higher the performance, the higher the cost). To ensure nonnegative costs, we further impose the following conditions: $c_{y}(0)\geq 0$, $\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}c_{t}(t)>0$, and $\lim_{a\rightarrow \infty}c_{a}(a)>0$.

Let $p_{i, k}(y_1,..., y_N, t_1, ..., t_N)$ be player $i$'s probability of winning the $k^{th}$ prize. Player $i$'s expected payoff is

\begin{equation}
  \label{expected payoff}
  \pi_i = \sum_{k=1}^{K} p_{i, k}(y_1,..., y_N, t_1, ..., t_N) V_k - C(a_i, y_i, t_i). 
\end{equation}


For convenience, suppose that to win a prize it is not sufficient to beat the other competitors but players have to successfully meet a given deadline and satisfy any minimum performance requirement. Let $\deadline>0$ denote a given deadline and $\target\geq 0$ a (possibly positive) required minimum performance. 

<!--
The goal for each player is If the timing is above a given deadline $d>0$ or the performance is below a certain level $q>0$, the player gets zero utility. Otherwise, the player is given a rank based on his performance and timing. 
 A contest is xxxx. Ranked . 
-->

The tournament competition corresponds to a special case where players that successfully meet the deadline (i.e., $t_i\leq\deadline$) are ranked by their performance and the probability of winning is
\begin{equation}
  xxxx.
\end{equation}

<!-- In a tournament, the agent having achieved the highest output quality within the deadline gets the first prize, the agent having achieved the second highest output quality gets the second prize, and so on. In a race, by contrast, the first agent to achieve an output quality of at least ${\bar y}$ within the deadline wins the first prize, the second to achieve the same target gets the second prize, and so on. -->

<!-- 
\begin{definition}
Let xxx denote the $N-1-k$ order statistic. A tournament is a contest game where the probability of winning the $k^{th}$ prize is 
\begin{equation}
  p_{k} = \Pr(y_i=xxxx\text{ and }t_i\leq \bar{t}). 
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
 -->

The race competition, by contrast, corresponds to a special case where players are ranked by their timing provided that the performance is above a minimum level ($y_i\geq\target$) and the probability of winning is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{probability in a race}
  xxxx.
\end{equation}


Note the "duality" of the two competitions. [@baye2003strategic]

Note that, in both competitions, if players xxxx they get no prizes (i.e., a rank $r > K$). 


Equilibrium
-------------

To simplify the analysis, we suppose there are only two prizes of total value normalized to one. We let $\alpha$ denote the fraction going to the first place which is larger than the fraction going to the second place ($\alpha\geq1/2$).

Following @moldovanu2001optimal, we characterize the unique symmetric equilibrium in a race competition. 

\begin{proposition}
Player $i$'s optimal performance $y^*(a_i)$ is equal to the minimum requirement $\target$ and the optimal timing $t^*(a_i)$ is given by
\begin{equation} 
  \label{eq: optimal time race}
  \ctime^{-1}\left[\ctime(\deadline) + \frac{1}{\cscore(\target)}\left(\alpha \int_{a_i}^{\infty} ... dz   + (1-\alpha) \int_{a_i}^{\infty} ...  dz\right)\right]
  \quad \text{if }\ability\geq\marginaltype, 
\end{equation}
and is equal to zero otherwise. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{shaded}
\begin{proof}
Consider player $i$'s choice and suppose that the other $N-1$ players use the equilibrium strategy stated in the proposition. Let $\phi=t^{-1}$ denote the inverse of the optimal bidding function. Player $i$'s best response is a timing $t_i$ and performance $y_i$ that maximize the expected payoffs \eqref{expected payoff} given the other players' equilibrium. 

Any $y_i > \target$ or $0<y_i<\target$ will raise costs while leaving unchanged the probability of winning. Thus, the choice of $y_i$ is binary. Either $y_i=0$ (with $t_i=\deadline$ by convention) or $y_i= \target$.

Suppose $y_i=\target$. The optimal $t_i$ maximizes the expected payoffs. To compute the expected payoff we use the following notation. For any sequence of variables $x_1, ..., x_{N-1}$,  let $x_{(1:N-1)}, ..., x_{(N-1:N-1)}$ denote the $N-1$ order statistics of the $x$'s, and let $F^x_{(1:N-1)}, ..., F^x_{(N-1:N-1)}$ be the corresponding distribution function. Then the probability of winning a prize \eqref{probability in a race} becomes:
\begin{align} \label{prob 1}
  p_{i, 1}(y_1,..., y_N; t_1,..., t_N)
    & = \Pr(t_i \leq t_{(1:N-1)}) \nonumber\\
    & = \Pr(t_i \leq t^*(a_{(1:N-1)})) \nonumber\\
    & = \Pr(\phi(t_i) \geq a_{(1:N-1)}) \nonumber\\
    & = F^a_{(1:N-1)}(\phi(t_i)).
\end{align}
\begin{align} \label{prob 2}
  p_{i, 2}(y_1,..., y_N; t_1,..., t_N) 
    & = \Pr(t_{(1:N-1)} < t_i \leq t_{(2:N-1)})  \nonumber\\
    & = \Pr(t_i\leq t_{(1:N-1)}\mid t_{(1:N-1)}<t_i) \Pr(t_{(1:N-1)} < t_i) \nonumber\\
    & = \Pr(\phi(t_i)\geq a_{(1:N-1)} \mid a_{(1:N-1)} > \phi(t_i)) \Pr(a_{(1:N-1)} > \phi(t_i)) \nonumber\\
    & \text{(using the independence of individual abilities)}\nonumber\\
    & = F^a_{(1:N-2)}(\phi(t_i))\left[1 - F^a_{(1:N-1)}(\phi(t_i))\right].
\end{align}
Using \eqref{prob 1} and \eqref{prob 2} with \eqref{expected payoff}, player $i$'s expected payoff is (to simplify notation, we drop the index $a$ on the distribution of the order statistics of the individual abilities)
\begin{align}
  \alpha F_{(1:N-1)}(\phi(t_i)) 
  + (1-\alpha) F_{(1:N-2)}(\phi(t_i))\left[1 - F_{(1:N-1)}(\phi(t_i))\right]
  - \costs.
\end{align}
The first order condition for a maximum \citep[see][]{moldovanu2001optimal} is
\begin{align} \label{foc0}
  0 = & \alpha F_{(1:N-1)}^{\prime}(\phi) \phi^{\prime} + \nonumber\\
    & + (1-\alpha)\phi^{\prime}\left\{
        \left[1 - F_{(1:N-1)}(\phi)\right]F_{(1:N-2)}^{\prime}(\phi)
        + F_{(1:N-1)}^{\prime}(\phi) F_{(1:N-2)}(\phi)\right\} + \nonumber\\
    & - c_{a}(a) c_{y}(\target) c_{t}^{\prime}(t_i).
\end{align}
Using $\phi^\prime =  1 / t^{*\prime}(\phi)$ and the equilibrium $\phi(t_i) = \phi(t^*(a_i)) = a_i$, leads to
\begin{align} \label{foc}
  c_{t}^{\prime}(t^{*}(a_i)) t^{*\prime}(a_i) 
      & = \frac{\alpha}{c_{a}(a) c_{y}(\target)} F_{(1:N-1)}^{\prime}(a_i)
        + \frac{(1-\alpha)}{c_{a}(a) c_{y}(\target)}\times \nonumber\\
      & \times\left\{\left[1 - F_{(1:N-1)}(a_i)\right]F_{(1:N-2)}^{\prime}(a_i)
        + F_{(1:N-1)}^{\prime}(a_i) F_{(1:N-2)}(a_i)\right\}.
\end{align}
This gives a differential equation with boundary conditions $t^*(\mtype) = \deadline$. 
Integrating both sides and using the integration rule $\int h(g(x)) g^\prime(x) dx = H(g(x)) + A$ (where $H(\cdot)$ is the antiderivative of $h(\cdot)$ and $A$ is an arbitrary constant) leads to
\begin{align} \label{foc}
  c_{t}(t^{*}(a_i))
      & = A + \frac{\alpha}{c_{y}(\target)} \int A(x) dx
        + \frac{(1-\alpha)}{c_{y}(\target)} \int B(x) dx
\end{align}
where 
\[
  A(x) = \frac{1}{c_{a}(x)} F_{(1:N-1)}^{\prime}(x)
\]
and
\[
  B(x) = \frac{1}{c_{a}(x)} \left\{
      \left[1- F_{(1:N-1)}(x)\right]F_{(1:N-2)}^{\prime}(x)
      + F_{(1:N-1)}^{\prime}(x) F_{(1:N-2)}(x)
    \right\}.
\]
Then we pin down the marginal type $\mtype$ by imposing the zero profit condition
%Now we need to show that this is greater than zero (the payoff obtained by setting $y^*=0$). That is:
\begin{align}
  \pi_i = & \alpha \left[1 - F_{(1:N-1)}(\mtype)\right] 
      + (1-\alpha) \left[1- F_{(1:N-2)}(\mtype)\right]F_{(1:N-1)}(\mtype) + \nonumber\\
    & - c_y(\target) c_a(\mtype) c_{t}(\deadline) = 0.
\end{align}
[Correction: it is not 1:N-1 but N-1:N-1]

Clearly, when $\marginaltype$ goes to infinity (costs go to zero), the probability that the N-1'th order statistics will be higher then xxx becomes zero. Hence, the payoff becomes $\alpha \geq 0$. If instead $\marginaltype$ goes to zero, then payoffs are negative. Hence, there is alpha in the middle... (need to show it is concave). 
\end{proof}
\end{shaded}


<!-- 
We provide here the symmetric equilibrium with one prize and $n>2$
agents. In appendix XXX, we provide a general formula for $k>2$ prizes.
Let $y_{1:n} < y_{2:n} < ... < y_{n:n}$ denote the order statistics of
the $y_j$’s for every $j\neq i$ and let ${F_{Y_{r:n}}}(\cdot)$ and
${f_{Y_{r:n}}}(\cdot)$ denote the corresponding distribution and density
for the $r$’th order statistic.
 -->

An important property of xxx is that $y^*(a_i)$ has its upper bound in xxx and
lower bound in xxxx. Also, equilibrium output quality is monotonic
increasing in the agent’s ability [see @moldovanu2001optimal]. Thus, for
every $i=1, ..., n+1$, the equilibrium expected reward depends only on
the rank of his ability relative to the others. Using ${F_{A_{r:n}}}$ to
denote the distribution of the $r$’th order statistic of abilities gives

\begin{equation} \label{equilibrium payoffs tournament}
  {F_{A_{n:n}}}(a_i) V_1  - C(y_i^*, d, a_i).
\end{equation}

Hence, by setting to zero and solving for the ability, gives the
marginal ability ${\underline a}$ as

\begin{equation}
  {\underline a}= h(n, V, F_A, C, d).
\end{equation}

- Using 'duality' property of these games, we determine the equilibrium behavior in a race as follows: 

\begin{proposition}
  Equilibrium behavior in a race is XXXX
\end{proposition}

Proposition. Let target xxx be higher in a race than in a tournament.Then, there always exist a non-empty set of abilities $\mathcal A_0 \subset \mathcal A$ where players in the race generate higher performance than in the tournament.  

Proof. Marginal type has utility zero in a race but the same type has a strictly positive utility in the tournament. Since probability of winning is not different in the race or the tournament (the bid is a monotonic transformation of the individual ability or, in other words, rankings are virtually the same), expected payoffs in equilibrium differ only in the cost functions. Hence, to be an equilibrium, the player in the tournament should bid less than the player in the race to earn a strictly positive expected payoff. 


Implications. The above proposition applies only if the target is higher in a race than in a tournament. But what if the two competitions had the same target ? In that case, tournaments and races have the same marginal type. Therefore, the performance of players in the tournament with reserve are always non-lower than those in the race. This does not imply that it is optimal to set the target. On the contrary, we will show that it is optimal to set an optimal target in a tournament that is below the optimal target in a race. Next section.  


Example. Consider the following example. 

```{r}
p <- plnorm   # pdf individual abilities 
r <- rlnorm   # Simulate individual abilities
cy <- function(x) x^2 # Cost function performance
ct <- function(x) 2*exp(1-x)  # Cost function timing 
```




The contest designer's problem
---------------------------

Let now focus on the contest designer's problem. Imagine the contest designer can choose the competition format to be either the race or the tournament. Let assume all other aspects of design are fixed. That is, suppose the deadline $\deadline$ is given and there is a minimum target that differs between the race and the tournament: $\target_\race > \target_\tournament$ (the latter normalized to zero $\target_\tournament=0$). Later we will relax this assumption to consider a more general setting where setting the target is also part of the contest designer's problem

Assume the contest designer wants to maximize an objective function that is linearly additive. Imagine this consists of the sum of the expected (highest) performance achieved and the corresponding time to completion. 

[Question: do the contest designers care about the second place? Assume they dom't.]

In a tournament, the objective function is
\begin{align}
R_\tournament & = \Pr(t_{(1:N)}\leq \deadline) \left\{\int_{a\in\mathcal A} y^*(x \mid t_{(1:N)}\leq \deadline) dF_{N:N}(x) - \tau \deadline - 1 \right\} \nonumber\\
  & = \int y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) - \tau \deadline - 1. 
\end{align}
(recall the prize pool is normalized to one). [Implicitly, you're assuming that the prize is always large enough to ensure positive effort.] [Second prize too is stochastic!!!!]

In a race, the objective function is
\begin{align}
R_\race & =  
  \Pr(a_{(N)}\geq \mtype) \left\{\target - \alpha -
  \Pr(a_{(N-1)}\geq \mtype) (1-\alpha) \right\}
  - \tau \int_{\mtype}^{\infty} t^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) \nonumber\\
  & = [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] \left\{\target - \alpha -
  [1-F_{N-1:N}(\mtype)] (1 - \alpha) \right\}
  - \tau \int_{\mtype}^{\infty} t^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x).
\end{align}


Note. $t^*(x) \leq \deadline$ for all $x$'s. Thus, a lower bound for the above objective function can be computed: 
\begin{align}
\underline {R_\race} & = 
  [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] \left\{\target - \alpha -
  [1-F_{N-1:N}(\mtype)] (1 - \alpha) - \tau \deadline\right\}
\end{align}
An even simpler lower bound is rewriting the above expression as if $\alpha=1$ (note if the real alpha was set 1 then also mtype would change and therefore setting alpha hits a lower bound only when mtype does xxxx  when alpha is 1). 
 
Note. $y^*(x)$ is lower than $\target$ for all $a < \mtype$. Thus, a lower bound of the tournament's expression is
\begin{align}
\overline {R_\tournament} & = 
  [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] \target + \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) 
  - \tau \deadline - 1. 
\end{align}

Proposition.  (a sufficient condition such that) the race "dominates" the tournament is such that $\tau \geq \hat \tau$ and otherwise the tournament.


Proof. Simple algebra.
\begin{align}
  \underline {R_\race} \geq & \overline {R_\tournament} \nonumber\\
  [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] (\target - 1 - \tau \deadline) \geq &
  [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] \target + \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) 
  - \tau \deadline - 1 \nonumber\\
  - [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] (\tau\deadline + 1) \geq &
  \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) 
  - (\tau \deadline + 1) \nonumber\\
  F_{N:N}(\mtype) (\tau \deadline + 1) \geq &
  \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) \nonumber\\
  \tau \geq & 
    \left[
      \frac{\int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x)}{F_{N:N}(\mtype)} -1 
    \right] \frac{1}{\deadline}
\end{align}

As a result, the intuition was correct. When the preference for time $\tau$ is sufficiently high, the race should be preferred. The threshold is a function of the deadline to complete the job (or time horizon). It also depends on the gains in terms of higher performance for all types above the marginal one. The lower the gains, the lower the threshold. 


Now we turn to discuss the contest designer's choice of an optimal minimum requirement $\target$. So far, we have assumed that $\target_\race>\target_\tournament$. Now, we show that the assumption that xxxx is indeed an optimal choice of the contest designer. This is summarized in the next proposition.

Proposition. Suppose the contest designer can choose the target that max profits in both the race and the tournament. Then, the optimal $\target$ in tournament is generally lower than that in a race.


To prove that it is indeed the case. We proceed in two steps. First, we assume that the contest designer does not care about minimizing the timing of the innovation by imposing $\tau = 0$. For simplicity, assume that $\alpha=1$ (winner-takes-all). In a race, this means that the optimal target will be a value that makes equal the costs in terms of less participation versus the gains in terms of higher values of the winning solutions. Formally, the contest designer's problem in a race is
\begin{align}
  \text{maximize } & R^\race = [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] (\target_\race - 1).
\end{align}
Note that $\mtype$ depends on the target. This is clearly concave in $\target_\race$. 
Thus, the first order condition is also sufficient. 
\begin{align}\label{foc race}
  \text{FOC } & \Rightarrow -F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) \mtype^\prime (\target_\race - 1) + [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] = 0.
\end{align}

In a tournament, ... 
\begin{align}
  \text{maximize } & R^\race = \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x, \target) d F_{N:N}(x) - [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)]. 
\end{align}
Convexity is not sure. If not, then the optimal target is zero. Which is lower than the optimal target in a race. 

Instead. If the objective function is (strictly) concave then there's an internal solution. 

\begin{align} \label{foc tournament}
  \text{FOC } \Rightarrow & 
    \frac{d\int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x, \target) d F_{N:N}(x)) }{d \target}
      + F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) \mtype^\prime =0 \nonumber\\ 
    & \text{(by using Leibniz rule)}\nonumber\\
  \Rightarrow & - y^*(\mtype, \target) \mtype^\prime F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) 
      + \int_{\mtype}^\infty \dystar - F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) \mtype^\prime = 0\nonumber\\
  \Rightarrow & -\target \mtype^\prime F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) 
      + \int_{\mtype}^\infty \dystar - F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) \mtype^\prime = 0.
\end{align}

Using \eqref{foc race} with \eqref{foc tournament}, the optimal target is the same in the race and the tournament only if
\begin{align} 
  \int_{\mtype}^\infty \dystar = [1- F_{N:N}(\mtype)].
\end{align}


\[
  \frac{\partial y^*(x, \target)}{\partial \target} = 
    \frac{c_y^\prime(\target)}{c_y^\prime(y^*(x, \target))}. 
\]

Then. 

- If $c_y(\cdot)$ is linear, we have that the ratio is one for all $x$. 

- If $c_y(\cdot)$ is convex, then we have that it is less than one. If 

- If $c_y(\cdot)$ is concave, then we have that it is higher than one.

As a result, if linear or convex the first order condition is lower than that in the race. Since the obj. function is concave (second order is decreasing), the target should be lower in a tournament than in a race to satisfy the first order condition.  (a lower target increases the focs.).

Conjecture. If $\tau>0$, the $\target$ in the race is higher.

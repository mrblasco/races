The model
=========

We generalize the _contest game_ introduced by @moldovanu2001optimal to a situation where players allocate their effort along two dimensions: performance and time. A (generalized) contest game is an N player game with asymmetric information. Players compete by choosing a performance variable $y_i$ and a timing $t_i$, both being nonnegative numbers. These variables can be thought of as the quality and time to completion of a job. Players move simultaneously to maximize the probability of winning a prize while minimizing the cost of effort. To simplify the analysis, we suppose only two prizes $V_1$ and $V_2< V_1$, the sum of which we normalize to one. Let $\deadline>0$ denote a given deadline and $\target\geq 0$ a (possibly positive) required minimum quality level. A player's probability of winning the $k^{th}$ prize is given by the function 
\begin{equation}
  \Pr(\text{player }i\text{ wins }V_k) = p_{k}(y_i, t_i; y_1,..., y_N, t_1, ..., t_N)
\end{equation} 
which is zero when either the performance is below the required minimum level $y_i<\target$ or the time to completion is above the deadline $t_i>\deadline$. 

Individual costs depend on the player $i$'s ability $a_i$ that is drawn from a common (continuous) distribution $F$ and it is privately observed at the beginning of the game.
The cost function is assumed to be multiplicative as 
\begin{equation}
  C(a_i, y_i, t_i) = c_a(a_i) c_y(y_i) c_t(t_i)
\end{equation}

where the functions $c_a(\cdot)$ and $c_t(\cdot)$ are monotonic decreasing whereas $c_{y}(\cdot)$ is monotonic increasing. To ensure nonnegative costs, we further impose $c_{y}(0)\geq 0$, $\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}c_{t}(t)>0$, and $\lim_{a\rightarrow \infty}c_{a}(a)>0$. 

<!-- 
The goal for each player is If the timing is above a given deadline $d>0$ or the performance is below a certain level $q>0$, the player gets zero utility. Otherwise, the player is given a rank based on his performance and timing. 
 A contest is xxxx. Ranked . 
 -->

The race and tournament competitions are defined as special cases of a generalized contest game.  Then a tournament is a contest game where players are ranked by their performance  $y_i$ but only if the time to complete the job is below a given deadline (i.e., $t_i \leq \bar{t}$). Formally: 

<!-- In a tournament, the agent having achieved the highest output quality within the deadline gets the first prize, the agent having achieved the second highest output quality gets the second prize, and so on. In a race, by contrast, the first agent to achieve an output quality of at least ${\bar y}$ within the deadline wins the first prize, the second to achieve the same target gets the second prize, and so on. -->

\begin{definition}
Let xxx denote the $N-1-k$ order statistic. A tournament is a contest game where the probability of winning the $k^{th}$ prize is 
\begin{equation}
  p_{k} = \Pr(y_i=xxxx\text{ and }t_i\leq \bar{t}). 
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Whereas a race is a contest game where players are ranked by their timing provided that the performance is above a minimum level $y_i\geq \underline y$.

\begin{definition}
Let xxx denote the $N-1-k$ order statistic. A race is a contest game where the probability of winning the $k^{th}$ prize is 
\begin{equation}
  p_{k} = \Pr(t_i=xxxx\text{ and }q_i\geq \underline{y}). 
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Note that, in both cases, if players xxxx they get no prizes (i.e., a rank $r > K$). 


Equilibrium
-------------

We provide here the symmetric equilibrium with one prize and $n>2$
agents. In appendix XXX, we provide a general formula for $k>2$ prizes.

Let $y_{1:n} < y_{2:n} < ... < y_{n:n}$ denote the order statistics of
the $y_j$’s for every $j\neq i$ and let ${F_{Y_{r:n}}}(\cdot)$ and
${f_{Y_{r:n}}}(\cdot)$ denote the corresponding distribution and density
for the $r$’th order statistic.

\begin{proposition}
In a tournament, the unique symmetric equilibrium of the model gives,
for every $i=1, ..., N$, the optimal time to completion $t^*(a_i)$ equal
to the deadline $\bar{t}$ and the optimal output quality $y^*(a_i)$ as
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq: optimal bid tournament}
  y^*(a_i) =  V_1 \int_{a_i}^\infty {f_{Y_{n:n}}} (z) dz
\end{equation}
if ${a_i}\geq \underline a$ (see @moldovanu2001optimal), and zero otherwise.
\end{proposition}

An important property of xxx is that $y^*(a_i)$ has its upper bound in xxx and
lower bound in xxxx. Also, equilibrium output quality is monotonic
increasing in the agent’s ability [see @moldovanu2001optimal]. Thus, for
every $i=1, ..., n+1$, the equilibrium expected reward depends only on
the rank of his ability relative to the others. Using ${F_{A_{r:n}}}$ to
denote the distribution of the $r$’th order statistic of abilities gives

$$\label{eq: expected payoffs tournament}
  {F_{A_{n:n}}}(a_i) V_1  - C(y_i^*, d, a_i).$$

Hence, by setting to zero and solving for the ability, gives the
marginal ability ${\underline a}$ as

$${\underline a}= h(n, V, F_A, C, d).$$


- Using 'duality' property of these games, we determine the equilibrium behavior in a race as follows: 

\begin{proposition}
  Equilibrium behavior in a race is XXXX
\end{proposition}


Contest designer's problem
---------------------------

The sponsor of the contest chooses the rules of the competition
including the prize structure $V_1$ and $V_2$, deadline $\deadline$, and target
quality $\target$. Here we focus on the decision of competition format (race or tournament) for a given $\deadline$ --- the same for everyone --- and a target $\target_\race>0$ in the race which is larger than in the tournament where it is normalized to zero (e.g., $\target_\tournament = 0$). Later we relax this assumption to consider an optimal $\target$. 

The contest designer's objective function is given by 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
    \mbox{maximize} & \int_{0}^{\infty} y^*(x) dF_{n:n}(x)
      - \tau \int_{0}^{\infty} t^*(x) dF_{n:n}(x) 
      - 1
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
where the expected quality of the winner and the expected time spent $T=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} T_i$ and prizes paid $V=\sum_{j=1}^k p_{j} V_j$ (with $p_j=1$ if the prize is awarded
and $p_j=0$ otherwise).


The main result is as given by the next proposition: 

\begin{proposition}
Given x, y, z, the optimal choice for the contest design is to pick a race when 
\begin{equation}
  \tau > \frac{\Delta y^*} {\Delta t^*} 
\end{equation}
and otherwise to pick the tournament.
\end{proposition}

This result hinges on $\target_\race > 0$. Now we show that, in general, it is always optimal to set a lower target in the tournament.  Maybe this lemma should go first and then the proposition. 

\begin{lemma}
Given x,y,z, it is optimal for the contest designer to choose $\target_\race > \target_\tournament$. 
\end{lemma}

Northern blotting with these cDNAs together with mouse cardiac (C) C-protein cDNA was performed. It revealed that in adult mice, C, F, and S isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion, although the messages for both F and S isoforms are transcribed in extensor digitorum longus muscle, which has been categorized as a fast muscle. In addition, although C isoform is expressed first and transiently during development of chicken skeletal muscles, C isoform is not expressed in mouse skeletal muscles at all through the developmental stages; S isoform is first expressed, followed by the appearance of F isoform. Finally, in dystrophic mouse skeletal muscles, the expression of S isoform is increased as it is in dystrophic chicken muscle. These observations suggest that mutations in C isoform (MyBP-C) do not lead to any disturbance in skeletal muscle, although they may lead to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We also suggest that the expression of S isoform may be stimulated in degenerating human dystrophic muscles.</text></passage></document><document><id>2</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Gene therapy for familial adenomatous polyposis.

It has been suggested that this is a consequence of the genomic instability associated with the syndrome. The elevated risk of malignancy is not, however, observed among A-T heterozygotes (except, apparently, regarding breast cancer). In this report we describe results from the study of the rare sporadic disease, T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL). In all individuals tested, we observed that at least one ATM allele was disrupted by rearrangement, that in many cases both alleles were disrupted and that there were additional mutations, predominantly missense, that clustered toward the 3' end of the gene corresponding to the protein's phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK)-related domain. We conclude that the ATM gene can act as a tumour suppressor in the development of sporadic T-PLL. Our finding of a surfeit of mutations within ATM may reflect the involvement of the gene at more than one step in tumorigenesis. In particular, we suggest that the clustering of missense mutations may pertain to the late-onset character of both sporadic and A-T-related T-PLL, since the closest homologue of Atm protein is the yeast TEL1 protein that maintains telomere length. ATM inactivation may not be the initiating event in T-PLL tumorigenesis: prior mutation of another gene--perhaps TCL1 activation--may be obligate. This would explain the recessive character of T-PLL risk in A-T.</text></passage></document><document><id>4</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Structure and chromosomal assignment of the sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP8B1) in human and mouse: eukaryotic cytochrome P-450 gene devoid of introns.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>157</offset><text>Sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) is a hepatic cytochrome P-450 that controls the ratio of cholic acid over chenodeoxycholic acid in bile and thus controls the solubility of cholesterol. Both the human and the mouse CYP8B1 complementary DNA and gene were cloned and structurally characterized. Surprisingly, the genomic DNA from both species was found to lack introns. The major transcript of the human gene was estimated to be 3950 bp, and the putative promoter region was estimated to be at least 1360 bp. The murine structural gene was found to span approximately 3 kb. By using FISH and radiation hybrid mapping techniques, the human CYP8B1 gene was located to chromosome 3p21.3-p22, whereas FISH mapped the murine counterpart to chromosome 9qF4, a region that is homologous to the third human chromosome. The results from the chromosome mapping and Southern blotting indicated that the gene is present in a single copy. Transcription of the mouse and human CYP8B1 genes was initiated from a position situated 51 and 35 bases, respectively, downstream of a consensus TATA box. A homology of 21% for the promoter regions of mouse and human may indicate differences in transcriptional regulation. Although a potent induction of CYP8B1 mRNA was observed upon starvation of mice, the mechanism behind this effect was not revealed by analysis of the promoter for potential cis-acting elements. In the human promoter, several possible cis-acting regions were identified but none of them could be directly related to bile acid metabolism. After transfection of COS cells with the human coding region, mRNA and enzymatic activity for the 12alpha-hydroxylase were identified. This is the first mammalian cytochrome P-450 gene reported to lack introns. The importance of this structural feature for evolution and gene regulation is discussed.</text></passage></document><document><id>5</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[A new book interpretation of red blood cell heat-sensitivity in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (author's transl)].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset></passage></document><document><id>6</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic craniofacial aberrations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>34</offset><text>Many craniofacial and dental anomalies have a genetic background.

The great majority of these tumors are benign in character. Here we present two brothers with hereditary glomus jugulare tumor who had consanguineous parents. Radiotherapy was applied approximately 8 and 10 years ago for treatment in both cases. Eight years later, one of these cases came to our notice due to relapse. The mutation pattern of p53, p57KIP2, p16INK4A and p15NK4B genes which have roles in the cell cycle, was analyzed in tumor samples obtained from the two affected cases in the initial phase and from one of these cases at relapse. The DNA sample obtained from the case in initial diagnosis phase revealed no p53, p57KIP2, p16INK4A or p15INK4B mutation. He is still in remission phase. Despite the lack of p53, p57KIP2, p16INK4A and p15INK4B mutation at initial diagnosis the tumor DNA of the other case in relapse revealed p53 codon 243 (ATG-->ATC; met-->ile) and p16 codon 97 (GAC-->AAC; asp-->asn) missense point mutations. No loss of heterozygosity in p53 and p16INK4A was observed by microsatellite analysis of tumoral tissues in these cases. P53 and p16INK4A mutations observed in relapse phase were in conserved regions of both genes. No previous reports have been published with these mutations in glomus tumor during progression. The mutation observed in this case may due to radiotherapy. In spite of this possibility, the missense point mutations in conserved region of p53 and p16INK4A genes may indicate the role of p53 and p16INK4A in tumor progression of glomus tumors.</text></passage></document><document><id>10</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Subcellular localization of BRCA1 protein in sporadic breast carcinoma with or without allelic loss of BRCA1 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>The localization of BRCA1 protein was studied in 49 sporadic breast carcinomas for which allelic losses of BRCA1 have been investigated.

The localization of BRCA1 in the 2 groups was performed using polyclonal antibodies (K-18; C-20; D-20; I-20) raised against BRCA1 and by comparing frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues. We show that no correlation was found between the expression of BRCA1 protein and allelic loss of BRCA1. But, the nuclear detection of BRCA1 in frozen samples was improved when compared to paraffinized ones.</text></passage></document><document><id>11</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation analysis of a putative sialyltransferase gene, the SFRS2 splicing factor gene and the c-myb ET-locus in two families with hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>170</offset><text>HNA is an autosomal dominant recurrent focal neuropathy involving the brachial plexus. The etiology of HNA is unknown but the genetic defect most likely affects a non-neuronal tissue. We previously described linkage to chromosome 17q24-q25 in two HNA-families. Here we report the mutation analysis of two candidate genes: a cDNA encoding a putative sialyltransferase and the SFRS2 splicing factor including the c-myb ET-locus which is encoded on the opposite strand of the SFRS2 gene. The complete protein coding regions of both genes were studied by direct DNA sequencing. We did not find a disease associated mutation indicating that these genes are most likely not involved in the pathogenesis of HNA. However, we identified and characterized a rare AvaII polymorphism in the SFRS2 gene and detected a sequencing error, leading to an amino acid change (Val11Leu) in the published sequence of the putative sialyltransferase.</text></passage></document><document><id>12</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Germ-line NF2 mutations and disease severity in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients with retinal abnormalities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset></passage></document><document><id>13</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel mutations in Rsk-2, the gene for Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, digit abnormalities and severe psychomotor retardation. CLS had previously been mapped to Xp22.2. Recently, mutations in the ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk-2) gene were shown to be associated with CLS. We have tested five unrelated individuals with CLS for mutations in nine exons of Rsk-2 using Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Two patients had the same missense mutation (C340T), which causes an arginine to tryptophan change (R114W). This mutation falls just outside the N-terminal ATP-binding site in a highly conserved region of the protein and may lead to structural changes since tryptophan has an aromatic side chain whereas arginine is a 5 carbon basic amino acid. The third patient also had a missense mutation (G2186A) resulting in an arginine to glutamine change (R729Q). The fourth patient had a 2bp deletion (AG) of bases 451 and 452. This creates a frameshift that results in a stop codon 25 amino acids downstream, thereby producing a truncated protein. This deletion also falls within the highly conserved amino-catalytic domain of the protein. The fifth patient has a nonsense mutation (C2065T) which results in a premature stop codon, thereby producing a truncated protein. These mutations further confirm Rsk-2 as the gene involved in CLS and may help in understanding the structure and function of the protein.</text></passage></document><document><id>14</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Phenotypic and genotypic investigations of a healthy volunteer deficient in the conversion of losartan to its active metabolite E-3174.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset></passage></document><document><id>15</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Restoration of transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway in human prostate cancer cells suppresses tumorigenicity via induction of caspase-1-mediated apoptosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>169</offset><text>Previous studies (Y. Guo and N. Kyprianou, Cell Growth Diff., 9: 185-193, 1998) have demonstrated that overexpression of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta type II receptor (TbetaRII) gene in human prostate cancer cells LNCaP, which are refractory to TGF-beta1 and lack TbetaRII receptor expression, can restore TGF-beta1 sensitivity and suppress in vitro tumorigenic growth by inhibiting cell proliferation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of TbetaRII receptor overexpression in LNCaP cells on apoptosis induction and tumorigenicity. The ability of LNCaP cells that overexpress TbetaRII to undergo apoptosis in response to TGF-beta1 was examined by DNA fragmentation and terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling analysis. To explore the potential apoptotic nature of TGF-beta1-mediated antitumor effect against human prostate cancer cells, the expression of apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bax was examined by Western blot analyses. The significance of caspase 1 in TGF-beta1-mediated apoptosis was also determined by examining the expression and activation of caspase 1 by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. Comparative analysis of tumorigenicity of the parental LNCaP and TbetaRII-overexpressing clones in severely combined immunodeficient mice revealed a significant suppression of tumor growth in TbetaRII transfectant clones compared with parental LNCaP cells and neomycin-control clones (P &lt; 0.05). A significantly higher incidence of endogenous apoptosis was observed in TbetaRII clone-61-derived tumor compared with the parental LNCaP tumors. This induction of apoptosis in the LNCaP tumors with restored TGF-beta1 signaling was associated with decreased bcl-2 expression, increased bax, and caspase-1 immunoreactivty. Moreover, an increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 was detected in TbetaRII-overexpressing tumors compared with the parental tumors. LNCaP TbetaRII transfectant cells exhibited a marked induction of apoptosis, paralleled with a decreased bcl-2 expression in response to TGF-beta1 treatment in vitro. This TGF-beta1-mediated apoptosis induction in TbetaRII transfectant cells was significantly protected by the caspase-1 inhibitor (zVAD-fmk) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a significant temporal induction of caspase-1 mRNA and protein expression was detected in TbetaRII cells in response to TGF-beta1 treatment. Our findings suggest that restoration of TGF-beta1 signaling suppresses tumorigenicity of human prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, potentially via a caspase-1-mediated pathway.</text></passage></document><document><id>16</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA 1, BRCA 2 models.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>23</offset></passage></document><document><id>17</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Urate nephropathy in childhood.

Visual loss typically involves retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve atrophy subsequent to a pathologic elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Some human glaucomas are associated with anterior segment abnormalities such as pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and iris atrophy with associated synechiae. The primary causes of these abnormalities are unknown, and their aetiology is poorly understood. We recently characterized a mouse strain (DBA/2J) that develops glaucoma subsequent to anterior segment changes including pigment dispersion and iris atrophy. Using crosses between mouse strains DBA/2J (D2) and C57BL/6J (B6), we now show there are two chromosomal regions that contribute to the anterior segment changes and glaucoma. Progeny homozygous for the D2 allele of one locus on chromosome 6 (called ipd) develop an iris pigment dispersion phenotype similar to human PDS. ipd resides on a region of mouse chromosome 6 with conserved synteny to a region of human chromosome 7q that is associated with human PDS. Progeny homozygous for the D2 allele of a different locus on chromosome 4 (called isa) develop an iris stromal atrophy phenotype (ISA). The Tyrpl gene is a candidate for isa and likely causes ISA via a mechanism involving pigment production. Progeny homozygous for the D2 alleles of both ipd and isa develop an earlier onset and more severe disease involving pigment dispersion and iris stromal atrophy.</text></passage></document><document><id>19</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Three major G6PD-deficient polymorphic variants identified among the Mauritian population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>We report the results of the first epidemiological study investigating glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency among the heterogenous Mauritian population. Mauritius has a population of approximately 1 million, and of these 66.8% are Indo-Mauritian (of Indian origin), 27.9% are Creoles (of African ancestry) and 2.1% are Sino-Mauritian, predominantly of Chinese origin. Of the 1435 Mauritian males tested, 73 (5.1%) were G6PD deficient. However, the prevalence varied considerably between the two major ethnic groups: 35/1157 (3.0%) for Indo-Mauritians and 37/267 (13.9%) for Creoles. Molecular analysis revealed three major deficient polymorphic variants; G6PD Orissa, G6PD Mediterranean and G6PD A-. G6PD Orissa (nt 131 G-->C; residue 44 Ala-->Gly) was found to be the most common variant among Indo-Mauritians: this deficient variant was recently identified to be highly characteristic of the tribal groups in central India. In Creoles the most common deficient variant was G6PD A- (27/37). These data are consistent with the different ancestral contributions to the present gene pool of the Mauritian population. This study has provided further information as to the precise nature of G6PD deficiency at the molecular level among Indians, about whom previously there was scant information. The data presented suggest that G6PD Orissa is widespread in central and southern states of India. Additionally, the identification and frequency of G6PD-deficient alleles in Mauritius is of public-health importance.</text></passage></document><document><id>20</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>cDNA cloning and mapping of a novel subtype of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT2) in human and mouse.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>We subcloned human and mouse full-length cDNAs of a novel subtype of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), which was designated GFAT2 (the previously reported GFAT was named GFAT1). Both the human and the mouse GFAT2 proteins deduced from their open reading frame sequences are composed of 682 amino acids of approximately 77.0 kDa. At the amino acid level, homologies between the human GFAT1 and GFAT2, between the mouse GFAT1 and GFAT2, and between the human GFAT2 and the mouse GFAT2 were 75.6, 74.7, and 97. 2%, respectively. Northern blot analysis using probe specific to human GFAT1 or GFAT2 showed that major transcripts were approximately 3.0 kb in both the human GFAT subtypes. The analysis also revealed different tissue distribution between GFAT1 and GFAT2: GFAT1 was more highly expressed in the placenta, pancreas, and testis than GFAT2; GFAT2 was expressed throughout the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord, but GFAT1 expression was weak. The locus was mapped to human chromosome 5q and mouse chromosome 11, where a synteny between the two species has been known. GFAT2 can provide insights into understanding the roles of the hexosamine pathway in various tissues, particularly with the development of glucose toxicity and diabetes complications.</text></passage></document><document><id>21</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Beta-catenin regulates expression of cyclin D1 in colon carcinoma cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour-suppressor gene occur in most human colon cancers. Loss of functional APC protein results in the accumulation of beta-catenin. Mutant forms of beta-catenin have been discovered in colon cancers that retain wild-type APC genes, and also in melanomas, medulloblastomas, prostate cancer and gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas. The accumulation of beta-catenin activates genes that are responsive to transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, with which beta-catenin interacts. Here we show that beta-catenin activates transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter, and that sequences within the promoter that are related to consensus TCF/LEF-binding sites are necessary for activation. The oncoprotein p21ras further activates transcription of the cyclin D1 gene, through sites within the promoter that bind the transcriptional regulators Ets or CREB. Cells expressing mutant beta-catenin produce high levels of cyclin D1 messenger RNA and protein constitutively. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative form of TCF in colon-cancer cells strongly inhibits expression of cyclin D1 without affecting expression of cyclin D2, cyclin E, or cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4 or 6. This dominant-negative TCF causes cells to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; this phenotype can be rescued by expression of cyclin D1 under the cytomegalovirus promoter. Abnormal levels of beta-catenin may therefore contribute to neoplastic transformation by causing accumulation of cyclin D1.</text></passage></document><document><id>22</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Defective dimerization of von Willebrand factor subunits due to a Cys-> Arg mutation in type IID von Willebrand disease. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>The same heterozygous T - > C transition at nt 8567 of the von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) transcript was found in two unrelated patients with type IID von Willebrand disease , with no other apparent abnormality .

This segment spans the RNU2 array, which includes 6-30 tandem copies of the U2 snRNA gene, and an adjacent region containing NBR1, the LBRCA1 pseudogene, NBR2, and BRCA1 in a tandemly duplicated structure. A series of biallelic polymorphisms define two common haplotypes that do not vary significantly, in structure or frequency, between populations of primarily European (n=275) or Asian (n=34) ancestry. Lower-frequency variants occurring at distantly located sites within this region also show very strong associations. The rarer haplotype classes appear to be distinguished by mutational alteration and are not recombination products of the two major classes. The two major haplotypes also exhibit significantly different allele-length distributions for local simple tandem-repeat markers. The conservation of extensive distinct chromosomal haplotypes during a long period of human population expansion and divergence indicates that selective forces or specific chromosomal mechanisms result in effective recombination suppression. The extreme degree of long-range linkage disequilibrium at this locus may be exceeded only by that reported for the human MHC locus, where allele-specific functional interactions are believed to be significant. These findings have implications for the estimation of the time of origin of BRCA1 mutations having a founder effect, the interpretation of the significance of rare allelic variants, and the study of the origins of modern populations.</text></passage></document><document><id>25</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever. No role of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in ten patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>85</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) and Familial mediterranean fever (FMF) are two common diseases in our region, Turkey. Both share some properties in common: Both cause AA type amyloidosis and have association with some immunological abnormalities. Upon incidentally observing Mycobacterium tuberculosis in bone marrow biopsies of three patients with FMF in a previous study, we intended to elucidate this association prospectively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we examined prospectively 10 FMF patients, 5 male and 5 female, with a median duration of 31 years disease activity. All were under colchicine therapy. They had no sign of renal involvement. The bone marrow biopsies of these patients were examined for the presence of M. tuberculosis by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), BACTEC culture and pathological stains. Pathological examination was performed for the existence of granuloma and amyloid deposition by hematoxylin-eosin, Crystal Violet and Congo red stains. RESULTS: The examination of all bone marrow specimens by the mentioned methods suggest that Mycobacterium tuberculosis has no role in the ethiopathogenesis of FMF. Although the patients had a positive family history of 60% for tuberculosis and in 80% of them with positive tuberculin skin test. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that although there seemed to be a kind of association between both diseases, this relationship is not via the direct existence of bacteria itself. Considering high family history and skin test positivity, one should look for the presence of autoimmune mechanisms under this suspicious relationship between tuberculosis and FMF. Also, this is the first study examined the state of amyloidosis in the bone marrow at an earlier stage of FMF without overt renal findings.</text></passage></document><document><id>26</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Influence of mild to moderately elevated triglycerides on low density lipoprotein subfraction concentration and composition in healthy men with low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>193</offset><text>Epidemiologic studies have shown that a dyslipoproteinemia with low concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and elevated serum triglycerides (TG) is associated with a particularly high incidence of coronary artery disease. This lipid profile is associated with increased concentrations of small, dense low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. To evaluate the role of mild to moderately elevated TG on the LDL subfraction profile in patients with low HDL cholesterol, concentration and composition of six LDL subfractions was determined by density gradient ultracentrifugation in 41 healthy men (31+/-9 years, body mass index (BMI) 25.1+/-3.9 kg/m2) with equally low HDL cholesterol levels &lt; 0.91 mmol/l but different TG levels: TG &lt; 1.13 mmol/l, n = 16; TG = 1.13-2.26 mmol/l, n = 13: TG = 2.26-3.39 mmol/l, n = 12. Those men with moderately elevated TG levels between 2.26 and 3.39 mmol/l had significantly higher concentrations of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate low density lipoprotein (IDL), and small, dense LDL apoB and cholesterol than men with TG &lt; 1.13 mmol/l. With increasing serum TG, the TG content per particle also increased in VLDL, IDL as well as total LDL particles while the cholesterol and phospholipid (PL) content decreased in VLDL and IDL, but not in LDL particles. LDL subfraction analysis revealed that only large, more buoyant LDL particles (d &lt; 1.044 g/ml) but not the smaller, more dense LDL, were enriched in TG. Small, dense LDL particles were depleted of free cholesterol (FC) and PL. This study has shown that in men with low HDL cholesterol levels mild to moderately elevated serum TG strongly suggest the presence of other metabolic cardiovascular risk factors and in particular of a more atherogenic LDL subfraction profile of increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles that are depleted in surface lipids.</text></passage></document><document><id>27</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Two cases of maternal uniparental disomy 14 with a phenotype overlapping with the Prader-Willi phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>106</offset></passage></document><document><id>28</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Inherited HFE-unrelated hemochromatosis in Italian families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset><text>Hemochromatosis (HH) is usually caused by the homozygous state for C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. A minority of iron loaded patients have no mutations in this gene. An infrequent subset shows an early-onset aggressive disorder, denoted juvenile hemochromatosis (JH), which has no linkage to 6p. In this report we describe six patients from three unrelated Italian families, four men and two women, aged 21 to 44 with the typical hemochromatosis phenotype, who are homozygous for the wild type allele at the HFE gene. In two families the disorder is unlinked to 6p; in one family some features of the juvenile form are seen, but linkage to 6p is not excluded. Our results point to genetic forms of hemochromatosis not associated with HFE and raise the problem of whether non-HFE hemochromatosis in Italy is related to the "juvenile" form. They also emphasize the importance of phenotypic as well as genetic diagnosis of HH.</text></passage></document><document><id>29</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Plasma lipoprotein distribution and lipid transfer activities in patients with type IIb hyperlipidemia treated with simvastatin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>129</offset><text>The aim of the present study was to search in type IIb hyperlipidemic patients for putative concomitant effects of simvastatin on the physicochemical characteristics of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL), as well as on the activities of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and the phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) that were determined in both endogenous lipoprotein-dependent and endogenous lipoprotein-independent assays. In a double-blind, randomized trial, patients received either placebo (one tablet/day; n = 12) or simvastatin (20 mg/day; n = 12) for a period of 8 weeks after a 5-week run-in period. Simvastatin, unlike placebo, reduced the lipid and apolipoprotein B contents of the most abundant LDL-1, LDL-2, and LDL-3 subfractions without inducing significant changes in the overall size distribution of LDL and HDL. Whereas simvastatin significantly increased PLTP activity in an endogenous lipoprotein-dependent assay (P &lt; 0.01), no variation was observed in a lipoprotein-independent assay. Simvastatin significantly decreased plasma CETP activity in an endogenous lipoprotein-dependent assay (P &lt; 0.01), and the reduction in plasma cholesteryl ester transfer rates was explained by a 16% drop in CETP mass concentration (P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, the specific activity of CETP was unaffected by the simvastatin treatment reflecting at least in part the lack of significant alteration in plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein acceptors. The simvastatin-induced changes in plasma CETP mass levels correlated positively with changes in plasma CETP activity (r = 0.483, P = 0.0561), in total cholesterol levels (r = 0.769; P &lt; 0.01), and in LDL-cholesterol levels (r = 0.736; P &lt; 0.01). Whereas the observations suggest that simvastatin might exert concomitant beneficial effects on plasma CETP and LDL levels, neither plasma cholesteryl ester transfer activity nor plasma phospholipid transfer activity appeared as the main determinants of the LDL and HDL distribution profiles in type IIb hyperlipidemic patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>30</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The type I serine/threonine kinase receptor ActRIA (ALK2) is required for gastrulation of the mouse embryo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>ActRIA (or ALK2), one of the type I receptors of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, can bind both activin and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in conjunction with the activin and BMP type II receptors, respectively. In mice, ActRIA is expressed primarily in the extraembryonic visceral endoderm before gastrulation and later in both embryonic and extraembryonic cells during gastrulation. To elucidate its function in mouse development, we disrupted the transmembrane domain of ActRIA by gene targeting. We showed that embryos homozygous for the mutation were arrested at the early gastrulation stage, displaying abnormal visceral endoderm morphology and severe disruption of mesoderm formation. To determine in which germ layer ActRIA functions during gastrulation, we performed reciprocal chimera analyses. (1) Homozygous mutant ES cells injected into wild-type blastocysts were able to contribute to all three definitive germ layers in chimeric embryos. However, a high contribution of mutant ES cells in chimeras disrupted normal development at the early somite stage. (2) Consistent with ActRIA expression in the extraembryonic cells, wild-type ES cells failed to rescue the gastrulation defect in chimeras in which the extraembryonic ectoderm and visceral endoderm were derived from homozygous mutant blastocysts. Furthermore, expression of HNF4, a key visceral endoderm-specific transcription regulatory factor, was significantly reduced in the mutant embryos. Together, our results indicate that ActRIA in extraembryonic cells plays a major role in early gastrulation, whereas ActRIA function is also required in embryonic tissues during later development in mice.</text></passage></document><document><id>31</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>ERG phenotype of a dystrophin mutation in heterozygous female carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>PURPOSE: Mutations in the dystrophin gene result in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is associated with an abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) if the mutation disrupts the translation of retinal dystrophin (Dp260). Our aim was to determine if incomplete ERG abnormalities would be associated with heterozygous carriers of dystrophin gene mutations. METHODS: Ganzfeld ERGs were obtained under scotopic and photopic testing conditions from a family which includes the heterozygous maternal grandmother, the heterozygous mother, and her children, two affected boys and dizygotic twin sibs, an unaffected male and heterozygous female. Southern blot analyses were done to characterise the dystrophin mutation. RESULTS: The dystrophin gene was found to contain a deletion encompassing exon 50. The ERGs in the two affected boys were abnormal, consistent with the DMD ERG phenotype. Serial ERGs of the heterozygous females were abnormal; however, they were less severely affected than the DMD boys. The ERG of the female sib showed a greater abnormality than her mother and maternal grandmother. The unaffected twin had a normal ERG. CONCLUSIONS: The ERG shows abnormalities associated with carrier status in this family with a single exon deletion. A large study of confirmed obligate carriers is planned to clarify further the value of the ERG in detecting female heterozygous carriers of dystrophin gene mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>32</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Maternal disomy and Prader-Willi syndrome consistent with gamete complementation in a case of familial translocation (3;15) (p25;q11.2). </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>137</offset><text>Maternal uniparental disomy ( UPD ) for chromosome 15 is responsible for an estimated 30 % of cases of Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) .

The recently identified gene/molecular abnormalities in these disorders have made more exact identification possible in many cases, although clinical testing is not always available. However, there are specific radiographic findings that allow the accurate diagnosis to be made, thus potentially guiding which molecular defect(s) should be investigated. The modes of inheritance of these distinct MED conditions are not identical. When a specific diagnosis is made, proper genetic counseling as well as prognostication, management issues and complications can be delineated to the patient and family.

Nevertheless, current research trends show a convergence of genetic, embryologic, neurocognitive, and neurobehavioral studies on an understanding of pathogenesis centered on the protein product of FMR1, FMRP, with a spectrum of neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunctions and deficits in turn depending upon tissue mosaicism and other factors determining FMRP production in critical tissues.

Topical application of 8-MOP PUVA induces malignant tumors in rodent skin, but little is known about its carcinogenicity in human skin. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the carcinogenicity of 8-MOP bath PUVA in humans. METHODS: This was a cohort study of 158 patients with psoriasis, for whom 8-MOP bath PUVA had been initiated during 1979 to 1992. The average number of 8-MOP bath PUVA treatments was 36 (range, 6 to 204) and the mean cumulative UVA dose was 92 J/cm2 (range, 3 to 884 J/cm2) by the end of 1995. The patients were not treated with any other forms of PUVA. Cancer incidence subsequent to 8-MOP bath PUVA up to the end of 1995 was determined by linking the cohort with the records of the Finnish Cancer Registry. The standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for skin cancer and some common internal cancers, using the expected numbers of cases based on the regional cancer incidence rates. RESULTS: There was one case of basal cell carcinoma, but no cases of other types of skin cancer. A total of 6 noncutaneous cancers were observed (SIR, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 2.8). CONCLUSION: No association between cutaneous cancer and 8-MOP bath PUVA was found, but the statistical power of this study alone is not adequate to warrant definite conclusions. The results can be used in a meta-analysis as soon as other studies on the carcinogenicity of 8-MOP bath PUVA are published.</text></passage></document><document><id>43</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical and neuroimaging study of central nervous system in congenital myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>We present the clinical and neuroimaging findings of five patients (four males, one female; mean age 12 years) affected by congenital myotonic dystrophy and the correlation with their molecular genetic analysis.

Seventeen (80%) of these cell lines had a common aberrant FHIT transcript as well as the normal transcript. Exon 2 was often aberrantly spliced to several coding exons, skipping exons 3 and 4, which overlap FRA3B. Other aberrant transcripts lacked exons 4-7 or exons 5-8. Exon 5, which has the initiation codon, was the most commonly affected. In two cell lines, Raji and KK124, there were aberrant transcripts retaining only the coding exons, which were able to make a normal protein, as demonstrated by in vitro transcription-translation analysis. In these aberrant messages, the additional deletion of 11 nucleotides at the beginning of exon 10 resulted in loss of translation. The cell line Ramos did not have a normal transcript. Some transcripts had common insertions of unknown origin that replaced coding exons, mainly exons 6 and 7. None of these aberrant messages coded for a protein, whether normal or aberrant. Within an individual cell line, aberrant messages appeared to result from sequential splicing reactions of a transcriptional unit derived from one allele. There was no correlation between aberrant FHIT transcription and the type of Burkitt's lymphoma regarding chromosomal translocation or presence of Epstein-Barr virus. In normal tonsils, spleen, and peripheral blood lymphocytes, aberrant transcripts were not detected and might represent a very minor subpopulation if detectable.</text></passage></document><document><id>47</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Confirmation of linkage in X-linked infantile spasms (West syndrome) and refinement of the disease locus to Xp21.3-Xp22.1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>The syndrome of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and mental retardation (West syndrome) is a classical form of epilepsy, occurring in early infancy, which is etiologically heterogeneous. In rare families, West syndrome is an X-linked recessive condition, mapped to Xp11.4-Xpter (MIM 308350). We have identified a multi-generation family from Western Canada with this rare syndrome of infantile spasms, seen exclusively in male offspring from asymptomatic mothers, thereby confirming segregation as an X-linked recessive trait. Using highly polymorphic microsatellite CA-repeat probes evenly distributed over the entire X chromosome, linkage to markers DXS7110, DXS989, DXS1202, and DXS7106 was confirmed, with a maximum LOD score of 3.97 at a theta of 0.0. The identification of key recombinants refined the disease-containing interval between markers DXS1226 and the adrenal hypoplasia locus (AHC). This now maps the X-linked infantile spasms gene locus to chromosome Xp21.3-Xp22.1 and refines the interval containing the candidate gene to 7.0 cM. Furthermore, this interval overlaps several loci previously linked with either syndromic or non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), including one recognized locus implicated in neuroaxonal processing (radixin, RDXP2). Collectively, these studies lend strong support for the presence of one or more genes intrinsic to brain development and function, occurring within the critical interval defined between Xp21.3-Xp22.1.</text></passage></document><document><id>48</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Cell cycle regulation after exposure to ionizing radiation].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>62</offset><text>When cells are exposed to ionizing radiation, they initiate a complex response that includes the arrest of cell cycle progression in G1 and G2, apoptosis and DNA repair. DNA is an important subcellular target of ionizing radiation, but oxydative damage to plasma membrane lipids initiates signal transduction pathways that activate apoptosis and that may play a role in cell cycle regulation. How is DNA damage converted into intracellular signals for cell cycle arrest? The ataxia telangectasia mutant (ATM) protein and/or the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), that are both activated by DNA damage, may initiate cell cycle arrest by activating the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The p53 protein acts as a transcription factor and regulates expression of several components implicated in pathways that regulate cell cycle progression. The best known, p21WAF1/CIP1 protein, is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), a family of protein kinases known as key regulators of cell cycle progression. p21WAF1/CIP1 was shown to be able to inhibit several CDK, but is most effective toward G1/S cyclins. Other CDK inhibitors, p27KIP1 and p15INK4b are activated by irradiation and contribute to the G1 arrest. Moreover, radiation-induced G2 arrest was shown to require inhibitory phosphorylation of the kinase cdc2 via an ATM-dependent pathway. Mutations in cell cycle regulatory genes are common in human cancer and cell cycle regulatory deficiency can lead to increase resistance to ionizing radiation in cancer cells. The major function of p53-dependent G1 arrest may be elimination of cells containing DNA damage whereas G2 arrest following radiation has been shown to be important in protecting cells from death. Cell cycle checkpoints offer a new set of potential targets for chemotherapeutic compounds, especially the G2 checkpoint. Thus, abrogation of the G2 checkpoint with methylxanthines such as caffeine or protein kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine and UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) was found to sensitize cells to ionizing radiation. These data did not lead to clinical applications, but confirm targeting of the G2 checkpoint may be an important strategy for cancer therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>49</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of the TCL1/MTCP1-like 1 (TML1) gene from the region next to the TCL1 locus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>The region on chromosome 14q32.1 is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations and inversions with one of the T-cell receptor loci in human T-cell leukemias and lymphomas. The breakpoints of the different rearrangements segregate into two clusters: inversion on the centromeric side and simple balanced translocations on the telomeric side. If the target gene activated by these different types of chromosomal rearrangements is the same, the gene must reside between the two clusters of breakpoints in a region of approximately 160 kb. By screening of a placenta cDNA library using genomic probes derived from the vicinity of TCL1 locus, we have identified a gene coding for a 1.7-kb transcript that is expressed in leukemic cells carrying a t(14;14)(q11;q32) chromosome translocation. The cognate cDNA sequence reveals an open reading frame of 384 nucleotides encoding a Mr 15,000 protein with approximately 30% of homology with both p14TCL1 and p13MTCP1 oncoproteins. The genomic organization of the TML1 locus was characterized, with three exons located 15 kb from and tail-to-tail in relation to TCL1 locus.

ARF binds directly to Mdm2 to prevent down-regulation of p53 and thereby promotes p53-dependent transcription and cell cycle arrest. However, ARF is not required for p53 induction in response to ionizing radiation or other forms of DNA damage. Animals lacking a functional ataxia telangiectasia (Atm) gene are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation; Atm-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) undergo premature replicative arrest, which is relieved by the loss of p53. Here we show that the loss of ARF expands the life expectancy of Atm-null MEFs, but alters neither the sensitivity of Atm-null mice to ionizing radiation nor their propensity to develop lymphomas early in life. Therefore, whereas ARF and Atm signal to p53 through distinct pathways, the loss of ARF can modify p53-dependent features of the Atm-null phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>51</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Seven novel mutations in the APC gene of Portuguese families with familial adenomatous polyposis: correlation with phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>Germ-line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

The combined use of these two methodologies allowed the identification of seven novel mutations, with two unrelated families sharing the same mutation. All mutations were chain terminating: six resulted from small deletions, one from a small insertion, and one was a point mutation, resulting in a premature stop codon. Seven mutations were located in exon 15 of the APC gene, one was in exon 10, and the remaining one, which corresponded to the kindred with an atypical phenotype, was located in exon 4.</text></passage></document><document><id>52</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Joint effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and eicosapentaenoic acids on serum lipid profile and plasma fatty acid concentrations in patients with hyperlipidemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>166</offset><text>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce serum total cholesterol concentrations and the risk of coronary heart disease in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Recently, it has been reported that patients with combined hyperlipidemia are also at risk of coronary heart disease. However, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy alone does not sufficiently reduce serum triglyceride concentrations. Epidemiological and clinical evidence has shown that fish oil can lower plasma lipid levels, especially triglycerides. Consequently, we investigated the effects of the combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and eicosapentaenoic acid, a major component of fish oil, on hyperlipidemia. We administered 900-1,800 mg/day of the ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid to patients with hyperlipidemia who had been treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for 30 +/- 6 months (means +/- SE). Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were significantly decreased 3 months after the administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (from 5.63 +/- 0.23 mmol/l to 5.02 +/- 0.20 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.05; from 2.07 +/- 0.41 mmol/l to 1.08 +/- 0.17 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.01, respectively). Serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations were significantly increased after the treatment (from 1.23 +/- 0.12 mmol/l to 1.34 +/- 0.13 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.05). Plasma eicosapentaenoic acid concentrations and the ratio to arachidonic acid in plasma were also significantly increased 3 months after the treatment (from 101.9 +/- 8.1 mg/l to 181.8 +/- 23.9 mg/l, P &lt; 0.001; from 0.640 +/- 0.075 to 1.211 +/- 0.170, P &lt; 0.001, respectively).

Interindividual variability in activity of enzymes involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to mutagenic diol epoxides may predict adduct levels and, indirectly, lung cancer risk. Using 32P-postlabeling methods, the levels of bulky DNA adducts were determined in macroscopically normal bronchial tissues obtained from resected lobes of 143 Hungarian patients with lung malignancy and other pulmonary conditions. DNA from normal tissue was also evaluated for polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) at two sites, codons 144 (Arg/Cys) and 359 (Ile/Leu), for glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) at codon 105 and for NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) at codon 187 (Pro/Ser). Using the Mann-Whitney U-test and analysis of variance, levels of adducts were evaluated in relation to variant genotypes, separately for smokers and non-smokers. As previously reported, bulky DNA adduct levels in smokers (n = 104) were estimated to be 54% higher than in non-smokers (n = 39) (8.6 +/- 4.2 versus 5.6 +/- 3.3 per 10(8) nucleotides, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). Adduct levels were 16-29% higher in individuals with the homozygous Ile359/Ile359 CYP2C9 allele than in those heterozygous for the variant allele (Ile359/Leu359) [8.8 +/- 4.3 (n = 84) versus 7.6 +/- 3.5 (n = 20) for smokers and 5.8 +/- 3.5 (n = 32) versus 4.5 +/- 1.3 (n = 7) for non-smokers], although differences were not statistically significant. There were no clear differences in adduct levels in relation to genotypes of NQO1 or GSTP1. Although numbers of patients in this study are large in relation to many studies of carcinogen-DNA adducts, it is still possible that significant differences were not noted for polymorphisms in xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes due to relatively small numbers in stratified data.</text></passage></document><document><id>54</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Defective control of apoptosis and mitotic spindle checkpoint in heterozygous carriers of ATM mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) carrier-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (AT-LCLs/hetero) with suboptimal ATM protein expression were examined for the regulation of radiosensitivity, apoptosis, and mitotic spindle checkpoint in response to DNA-damaging agents. Although AT-LCLs/hetero showed intermediate radiation sensitivity, as determined by clonogenic assay, they were resistant to early-onset apoptosis, as much as AT patient-derived LCLs (AT-LCLs/homo). Furthermore, two of three AT-LCLs/hetero showed defective mitotic spindle checkpoint control in response to X-ray irradiation, which is a recently characterized biological feature in AT-LCLs/homo. Our findings indicate that carriers of ATM mutation have biological abnormalities due to haploinsufficiency of ATM protein or dominant-negative effect of mutant ATM protein. Thus, although it is still controversial whether ATM mutation carriers are at higher risk for cancer during adulthood, our findings based on in vitro biological indicators support the notion that at least some of such carriers are at a higher risk for cancer development than those without ATM mutation. Our findings may help to reevaluate epidemiological studies on cancer susceptibility in AT carriers.</text></passage></document><document><id>55</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetics of Angelman syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>31</offset></passage></document><document><id>56</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>In utero fetal muscle biopsy: a precious aid for the prenatal diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>Prenatal diagnosis for Duchenne muscular dystrophy can usually be performed using DNA analysis.

The skeletal alterations in the present disorder, including generalized osteopenia, mild modification of the vertebral endplates, epiphyseal flattening of the long bones, broad proximal femora with a spur-like projection of the lesser trochanters (a monkey wrench appearance of the proximal femora), and advanced carpal skeletal age, are almost identical to those of Desbuquois dysplasia. However, postnatal growth failure and minor spondylo-articular problems in the present disorder contrast with the conspicuous prenatal growth failure and severe spondylo-articular deformities of Desbuquois dysplasia. Short stature in the present disorder does not reach the degree of Desbuquois dysplasia. Molecular investigation of one patient excluded abnormalities of the diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter gene. CONCLUSION: The combination of skeletal alterations identical to those of Desbuquois dysplasia with milder short stature and spondylo-articular problems in the present patients suggests the nosological proposal of "a mild variant of Desbuquois dysplasia".</text></passage></document><document><id>59</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genomic organization and chromosomal localization of the human cathepsin L2 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset><text>Cathepsin L2 is a recently described cysteine proteinase with high sequence homology to cathepsin L and other members of the papain superfamily of cysteine proteinases.

The gene spans approximately 6.4 kb and consists of eight exons and seven introns. Genomic organization was similar to human cathepsin L and more than 50% similarity was found between the first introns of cathepsin L and L2, suggesting that they diverged late in evolution. The transcription initiation site, determined by primer extension, was 198 nucleotides from the first ATG. The 5' flanking region lacks a TATA box but has one SP1 site.

As the etiology of these acquired PIG-A gene mutations is unknown, we hypothesized that patients with PNH have overall genetic instability and acquire somatic mutations throughout their genome. We first analyzed microsatellite sequences and found equivalent size variation using DNA from GPI-negative granulocytes compared with the DNA of paired GPI-positive B cell lines or normal granulocytes. We next quantitated the frequency of mutations at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) gene locus, and found 1 PNH patient with a large increase in hprt mutant frequency (256.7 x 10(-6) vs. 27.8 +/- 19.9 x 10(-6) for normal adults) that was confirmed on 4 independent blood samples. We also quantitated "illegitimate" VDJ genetic recombination events between the T cell receptor V gamma and J beta gene loci, and found a second PNH patient with a large increase (43.5 events per microgram of DNA vs. 1.3 +/- 0.8 events per microgram of DNA for normal adults), confirmed on 4 independent DNA samples. Both of these PNH patients are young females with no history of aplastic anemia. Our data show that PNH patients can have increased numbers of acquired somatic mutations in gene loci distinct from PIG-A. These data suggest that genetic instability may be associated with the development of PIG-A mutations that lead to the clinical picture of PNH.</text></passage></document><document><id>61</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Exon-intron structure of the human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit (CHRNA4). </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>The human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit gene ( CHRNA4 ) is located in the candidate region for three different phenotypes  benign familial neonatal convulsions , autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy , and low-voltage EEG .

We studied the roles of hemolysis by blood carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) determinations and of the variant promoter of the gene for the bilirubin-conjugating enzyme uridine 5'-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) seen in Gilbert's syndrome in the pathogenesis of the hyperbilirubinemia. METHODS: Consecutively born, healthy, term, female neonates were screened for G-6-PD deficiency and observed clinically with serum bilirubin evaluations as indicated for hyperbilirubinemia. On day 3, blood was sampled for COHb, total hemoglobin (tHb), and a mandatory serum bilirubin determination. COHb, determined by gas chromatography, was expressed as percentage of tHb and corrected for inspired carbon monoxide (COHbc). DNA was analyzed for the G-6-PD Mediterranean563T mutation and for the variant UGT1A1 gene. RESULTS: The cohort included 54 G-6-PD-deficient heterozygotes, 19 deficient homozygotes, and 112 normal homozygotes. More heterozygotes (12/54, 22%; relative risk: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.07-4.80) and deficient homozygotes (5/19, 26.3%; relative risk: 2.68; 95% CI: 1.05-6.90) developed hyperbilirubinemia, than did normal homozygotes (11/112, 9.8%). Third-day serum bilirubin values that were obtained from 144 neonates were significantly higher in both heterozygotes (11.2 +/- 3. 7 mg/dL [192 +/- 64 micromol/L]) and G-6-PD-deficient homozygotes (12.0 +/- 3.0 mg/dL [206 +/- 52 micromol/L]) than in the G-6-PD normal homozygotes (9.4 +/- 3.4 mg/dL [160 +/- 58 micromol/L). In contrast, COHbc values were higher only in G-6-PD-deficient homozygotes (0.74% +/- 0.14%) and not in heterozygotes (0.69% +/- 0. 19%, not statistically significant), compared with control values (0. 63% +/- 0.19%). High COHbc values were not a prerequisite for the development of hyperbilirubinemia in any of the G-6-PD genotypes. A greater incidence of hyperbilirubinemia was found among the G-6-PD-deficient heterozygotes, who also had the variant UGT1A1 gene, in both heterozygous (6/20, 30%) and homozygous (4/8, 50%) forms, than was found in their counterparts with the normal UGT1A1 gene (2/26, 7.7%). This effect was not seen in the G-6-PD normal homozygote group. A color reduction screening test for G-6-PD deficiency identified only 20.4% (11/54) of the heterozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that G-6-PD-deficient heterozygotes, categorically defined by DNA analysis, are at increased risk for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The screening test that was used was unable to detect most heterozygotes. Increased bilirubin production was not crucial to the development of hyperbilirubinemia, but presence of the variant UGT1A1 gene did confer increased risk.</text></passage></document><document><id>63</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations in SLC19A2 cause thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia associated with diabetes mellitus and deafness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia (TRMA), also known as Rogers syndrome, is an early onset, autosomal recessive disorder defined by the occurrence of megaloblastic anaemia, diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness, responding in varying degrees to thiamine treatment (MIM 249270). We have previously narrowed the TRMA locus from a 16-cM to a 4-cM interval on chromosomal region 1q23.3 (refs 3,4) and this region has been further refined to a 1.4-cM interval. Previous studies have suggested that deficiency in a high-affinity thiamine transporter may cause this disorder. Here we identify the TRMA gene by positional cloning. We assembled a P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) contig spanning the TRMA candidate region. This clarified the order of genetic markers across the TRMA locus, provided 9 new polymorphic markers and narrowed the locus to an approximately 400-kb region. Mutations in a new gene, SLC19A2, encoding a putative transmembrane protein homologous to the reduced folate carrier proteins, were found in all affected individuals in six TRMA families, suggesting that a defective thiamine transporter protein (THTR-1) may underlie the TRMA syndrome.</text></passage></document><document><id>64</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Phenylketonuria mutations in Germany.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>38</offset><text>We report the spectrum of mutations and associated modified haplotypes in patients with phenylketonuria living in Germany.

The most common mutation was R408W on 22% of alleles. Two mutations, IVS12+1G-->A and IVS10-11G-->A accounted for just under 10% of alleles, whereas the remaining mutations were found at relative frequencies of 6% or less; 43 mutations were observed once only. IVS10-11G-->A was the most common mutation (38% of alleles) in the subgroup of patients of Turkish descent. Modified haplotypes were determined from the analysis of four silent mutations, three diallelic restriction fragment length polymorphisms, a variable number of tandem repeats minisatellite and a short tandem repeat microsatellite in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, showing that a considerable proportion of mutations must have recurred in independent founders; other mutations may have changed chromosomal haplotype backgrounds by gene conversion.

We describe a de novo point mutation at the 5' splice donor site of exon 5 in a 17-year-old male with PMD, which results in the skipping of 42 base pairs of exon 5. The mutation removes only 14 amino acids in-frame of PLP. This is a novel splice donor site mutation in the human PLP gene. Moreover, the results indicate that the 14-amino acid deletion in the PLP is responsible for oligodendrocyte cell death and the development of PMD.</text></passage></document><document><id>66</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Glucose-galactose malabsorption.

XLDC is a rare disease and only few families have been fully characterised. In several of them, the dystrophin mutations show a different pattern of expression in cardiac compared to skeletal muscle. In the families with the most severe cardiac phenotype, the cardiac muscle is usually unable to produce dystrophin, due to a specific effect that the mutation(s) have on the gene transcription in this tissue. The skeletal muscle escapes the dystrophic changes by maintaining dystrophin synthesis via exon skipping or alternative splicing that the heart is not able to put in place. In this paper we have reviewed the families with X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy reported so far; in addition we provided novel transcription data on two families we previously described. The aim of this review is to attempt a genotype-phenotype correlation and speculate on common pathogenic mechanisms underlying this disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>69</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations in the vasopressin prohormone involved in diabetes insipidus impair endoplasmic reticulum export but not sorting.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>Familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus is characterized by vasopressin deficiency caused by heterozygous expression of a mutated vasopressin prohormone gene.

Metabolic labeling demonstrated that processing and secretion of all five mutants was impaired, albeit to different extents (NP65G-->V >/= NP14G-->R > NP47DeltaE >/= NP47E-->G > NP57G-->S). Persisting endoglycosidase H sensitivity revealed these defects to be due to retention of mutant prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutant prohormones that partially passed the endoplasmic reticulum were normally targeted to the regulated secretory pathway. Surprisingly, this also included mutants with mutations in residues involved in binding of vasopressin to neurophysin, a process implicated in targeting of the prohormone. To mimick the high expression in vasopressin-producing neurons, mutant vasopressin prohormones were transiently expressed in Neuro-2A cells. Immunofluorescence displayed formation of large accumulations of mutant prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum, accompanied by redistribution of an endoplasmic reticulum marker. Our data suggest that prolonged perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum eventually leads to degeneration of neurons expressing mutant vasopressin prohormones, explaining the dominant nature of the disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>70</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genes essential for early events in gonadal development.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>57</offset><text>The acquisition of a sexually dimorphic phenotype is a critical event in mammalian development. The basic underlying principle of sexual development is that genetic sex-determined at fertilization by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome--directs the embryonic gonads to differentiate into either testes or ovaries. Thereafter, hormones produced by the testes direct the developmental program that leads to male sexual differentiation. In the absence of testicular hormones, the female pathway of sexual differentiation occurs. Recent studies have defined key roles in gonadal development for two transcription factors: Wilms' tumor suppressor 1 (WT1) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). After presenting a brief overview of gonadal development and sexual differentiation, this paper reviews the studies that led to the isolation and characterization of WT1 and SF-1, and then discusses how interactions between these two genes may mediate their key roles in a common developmental pathway.</text></passage></document><document><id>71</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Maternal phenylketonuria: a continuing problem.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>48</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the number of women of childbearing age in New South Wales whose children are at risk of the maternal phenylketonuria (PKU) syndrome (intellectual disability, microcephaly, congenital malformations). SETTING: New South Wales, 1996. DESIGN: Comparison of number of women with PKU aged 15-44 years on the NSW PKU database (observed number) with expected number derived from population data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed and expected numbers of women with PKU (defined as blood phenylalanine levels > or = 400 mumol/L, and phenylalanine-restricted diet recommended) by age; number with no clinical contact with the PKU service in previous year; outcomes of pregnancies in women with PKU (January 1994 to July 1996). RESULTS: 110 women aged 15-44 years with PKU were listed on the database. The expected number was 145 (95% confidence interval, 122-171). The difference was greatest in the 30-44 years age group (born before comprehensive newborn screening), with only 55% of the expected number listed. Sixteen women who had been diagnosed with PKU at birth were not having regular follow-up, while 18 women had been diagnosed only after investigation of abnormalities in their children. Of 28 pregnancies managed by the NSW PKU service, 19 were considered unaffected by the maternal PKU syndrome and five affected (another three did not reach term; one outcome was unknown). Of 46 unmanaged pregnancies, all were affected. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for better follow-up of women with PKU and for education of health professionals about the MPKU syndrome, its recognition, the risks of untreated pregnancy and the benefits of dietary treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>72</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Frequent co-alterations of TP53, p16/CDKN2A, p14ARF, PTEN tumor suppressor genes in human glioma cell lines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>In this study we established the simultaneous status of TP53, p16, p14ARF and PTEN tumor suppressor genes in 34 randomly chosen human glioma cell lines. Nine cell lines (26.4%) harbored mutations or deletions in all four tumor suppressor genes and 22 cell lines (64%) had alterations in at least three. Mutations/deletions were found at the following frequencies: TP53 (76.5%), p14ARF (64.7%), p16 (64.7%), PTEN (73.5%). Thus, there was a high incidence of alterations in the cellular pathways involving the p53 transcription factor (94.1%), the retinoblastoma protein (64.7%) and the PTEN phosphatase (73.5%) and 91% of cell lines carried mutations in two or more pathways. This provides the first clear genetic evidence that these tumor suppressors participate in biological pathways which are functioning separately/independently in glioma cells. The status of the gene alterations did not correlate with tumorigenicity in immunocompromized mice or any clinical parameters. Although the mutation rate was higher in glioma cell lines than that reported for glioma tissues, the alterations were molecularly representative of those found in adult de novo glioblastoma. This study highlights the importance of developing therapeutic approaches applicable to tumors with a broad range of genetic alterations and also provides an invaluable panel of glioma cell lines to make this possible.</text></passage></document><document><id>73</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Visual impairment and REP-1 gene mutations in Japanese choroideremia patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>Choroideremia (CHM), an X-linked recessive hereditary disease, is an intractable chorioretinal dystrophy.

Mutation analyses of the REP-1 gene revealed 10 types of mutations in 13 patients from 11 families, including an insertion, small deletions, nonsense mutations and an A to CC mutation. In 13 CHM patients with detectable REP-1 gene mutations, no relationship of genotype to phenotype was detected. At present, we consider the REP-1 genotype to be an unreliable prognostic factor for counseling of CHM patients. In two patients from one family, no mutations were detected in coding regions of the REP-1 gene. These patients may have intron mutations of the REP-1 gene, not detectable by the techniques employed in this study, or other causative genes. Both were observed to have somewhat slower disease progression than the other 13 patients. More advanced analyses are necessary to answer questions regarding the genotype-phenotype relationship in CHM patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>74</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Nucleotide sequence of rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset><text>The previously unknown sequences of the coding and 3'-flanking regions of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene were determined.

Several C1q binding proteins have been proposed as candidate receptors for these functions. The 126-kDa human C1q membrane receptor, termed C1qR(p), has recently been cloned. This molecule is believed to play a role in the enhancement of phagocytosis in monocytes and macrophages, and its expression has been shown to be restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage, endothelial cells, and platelets. Here we report the isolation and genomic characterization of the murine homolog of C1qR(p). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the published human sequence were used to amplify a region of the murine homolog spanning from the carbohydrate recognition domain to the fourth epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain. This fragment was used as a probe to isolate the murine gene from a 129/Sv genomic lambda library. The predicted primary protein sequence displayed 68.1% identity with the human homolog. All the major structural domains were conserved between the two molecules. The coding sequence of the murine gene was contained within two exons separated by a small intron of approximately 250 bp. The structure of the human gene was found to be similar, with the position of the intron conserved. Cloning of the murine C1qR(p) will facilitate further investigation of the physiological function of this molecule.</text></passage></document><document><id>77</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Polyglutamine pathogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>28</offset><text>An increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders have been found to be caused by expanding CAG triplet repeats that code for polyglutamine. Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common of these disorders and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is very similar to HD, but is caused by mutation in a different gene, making them good models to study. In this review, we will concentrate on the roles of protein aggregation, nuclear localization and proteolytic processing in disease pathogenesis. In cell model studies of HD, we have found that truncated N-terminal portions of huntingtin (the HD gene product) with expanded repeats form more aggregates than longer or full length huntingtin polypeptides. These shorter fragments are also more prone to aggregate in the nucleus and cause more cell toxicity. Further experiments with huntingtin constructs harbouring exogenous nuclear import and nuclear export signals have implicated the nucleus in direct cell toxicity. We have made mouse models of HD and DRPLA using an N-terminal truncation of huntingtin (N171) and full-length atrophin-1 (the DRPLA gene product), respectively. In both models, diffuse neuronal nuclear staining and nuclear inclusion bodies are observed in animals expressing the expanded glutamine repeat protein, further implicating the nucleus as a primary site of neuronal dysfunction. Neuritic pathology is also observed in the HD mice. In the DRPLA mouse model, we have found that truncated fragments of atrophin-1 containing the glutamine repeat accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that proteolysis may be critical for disease progression. Taken together, these data lead towards a model whereby proteolytic processing, nuclear localization and protein aggregation all contribute to pathogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>78</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of the subcellular localization of huntingtin with a set of rabbit polyclonal antibodies in cultured mammalian cells of neuronal origin: comparison with the distribution of huntingtin in Huntington's disease autopsy brain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>232</offset><text>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a midlife onset. The disease is caused by expansion of a CAG (glutamine) repeat within the coding region of the HD gene. The molecular mechanism by which the mutated protein causes this disease is still unclear. To study the protein we have generated a set of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against different segments of the N-terminal, central and C-terminal parts of the protein. The polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified and characterized in ELISA and Western blotting experiments. All antibodies can react with mouse and human proteins. The specificity of these antibodies is underscored by their recognition of huntingtin with different repeat sizes in extracts prepared from patient-derived lymphoblasts. The antibodies were used in immunofluorescence experiments to study the subcellular localization of huntingtin in mouse neuroblastoma NIE-115 cells. The results indicate that most huntingtin is present in the cytoplasm, whereas a minor fraction is present in the nucleus. On differentiation of the NIE-115 cells in vitro, the subcellular distribution of huntingtin does not change significantly. These results suggest that full-length huntingtin with a normal repeat length can be detected in the nucleus of cycling and non-cycling cultured mammalian cells of neuronal origin. However, in HD autopsy brain the huntingtin-containing neuronal intranuclear inclusions can be detected only with antibodies raised against the N-terminus of huntingtin. Thus several forms of huntingtin display the propensity for nuclear localization, possibly with different functional consequences.</text></passage></document><document><id>79</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Spinal muscular atrophy: a hexosaminidase A deficiency phenotype].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset></passage></document><document><id>80</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cognitive impairment and (CTG)n expansion in myotonic dystrophy patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a genetic multisystemic disease with muscular, endocrine, ocular, cardiac and cognitive impairment. The molecular basis of the disease has been identified in an unstable base triplet (CTG)n repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of the miotonin protein-kinase (MT-PK) gene on the long arm of chromosome 19. Cognitive impairment could be a direct expression of this genetic alteration at the central nervous system (CNS) level rather than a consequence of the neuromuscular impairment. To explore this hypothesis, we tested a group of genetically diagnosed, adult onset DM, of their nonaffected relatives (NAR), of patients with spinal muscle atrophy (SMA), and of normal controls using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). METHODS: Seventeen adult-onset DM patients, 9 NAR, 10 SMA patients and 20 unrelated normal controls (NC) were studied. Clinical, neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric evaluation, which included WAIS and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS), were performed on the four groups. DM, NAR and NC were also assessed by a neurophysiological (P300) evaluation. A DNA analysis was performed in DM and in NAR to measure presence and magnitude of CTG expansion. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference between verbal (p &lt; .0003), nonverbal (p &lt; .0001) and total (p &lt; .0001) IQ of DM patients compared to IQs of NAR, SMA and NC. Seven out of 11 WAIS subtests were significantly and consistently lower in DM patients compared to SMA and/or NC. In DM patients there was a statistically significant negative correlation between nonverbal (r = -.68; p &lt; .002) and total (r = .59; p &lt; .01) IQ and (CTG)n. Patients with DM had a significantly lower P300 amplitude compared to NAR and NC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that in DM there is a mild but significant cognitive impairment which correlates with the degree of CTG expansion and it is not dependent on the neuromuscular impairment; however further studies with larger groups of patients and controls are suggested to confirm our results, due to the small sample size and to a possible effect of educational level in our patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>81</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial gastric cancer in the Japanese population is frequently located at the cardiac region.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>The clinical features of familial gastric cancer are still unknown. To approach this question, we investigated the clinicopathological characteristics of 16 cases of familial gastric cancer. In this study the criteria used to define familial gastric cancer was the existence of three or more family members with gastric cancer in at least two successive generations. The clinicopathological characteristics of cases who fulfilled this criteria were studied. This study contained 16 familial gastric cancer probands. Seven cases (44%) of gastric cancer had developed at the cardiac region of the stomach. This frequency was significantly higher than for gastric cancer in the general population in Japan (15.4%, p &lt; 0.01). Undifferentiated types were dominant in familial gastric cancer (69%, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the frequency of disseminated peritoneal (40%) and liver metastases (20%) in familial gastric cancer was also significantly higher than for gastric cancer in the general population in Japan (10.9%, p &lt; 0.01, and 4.4%, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Familial gastric cancers were frequently located at the cardiac region and appeared to be more aggressive than sporadic gastric cancers.

Eleven His-SGLT1 mutants were constructed and were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. As demonstrated by immunofluorescent labeling with antipeptide antibodies against SGLT1, all mutants were expressed and inserted into the plasma membrane. Only mutants with the tag in the N-terminal region and the C-terminal region retained Na+/glucose cotransport activity at 0.1 mM D-glucose. The arrangement of the His-tag in the membrane was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence, using a monoclonal antihistidine antibody. In nonpermeabilized cells the His-tag could be detected at the N-terminal end (insertion at aa 5) and at the C-terminal end (replacement between aa 584-589 and between aa 622-627), suggesting that these portions of the polypeptide are accessible from the extracellular space. Furthermore, an epitope-specific antibody directed against aa 606-630 reacted strongly with the cell surface. To support this topology intact stably transfected SGLT1 competent CHO cells were partially digested with an immobilized trypsin and subsequently subjected to electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. The size of the digestion product suggests that extravesicular trypsin removed the extracellular loop that contains the amino acid residues 549-664. Thus our results indicate that the last large loop (about aa 541-aa 639) towards the C-terminal end faces the cell exterior where it might be involved in substrate recognition.</text></passage></document><document><id>83</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Concurrence of Pendred syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, and simple goiter in one family.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>Pendred syndrome is the autosomal recessively transmitted association of familial goiter and congenital deafness.

Pendred syndrome is caused by mutations within the putative ion transporter gene (PDS gene), located on chromosome 7q. A wide variation in the clinical presentation of this condition, and its well documented phenotypic overlap with other thyroid disorders (such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis), can lead to diagnostic difficulties. The potential for misdiagnosis increases when these disorders occur coincidentally in the same family.

An increased brainstem auditory evoked response threshold has been previously reported in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, suggesting that full-length dystrophin (Dp427) is involved in hearing. The objective of the present study was to confirm cochlear dysfunction with this gene defect and determine whether the shorter carboxyl terminus isoforms of dystrophin are also critical in maintaining normal hearing. STUDY DESIGN: Case controlled. Animal model. METHODS: Auditory brainstem response (ABR) audiometry to pure tones was used to evaluate cochlear function. Fourteen mdx, 4 mdx(Cv3), and 13 age-matched control (C57BL/6J and C57BL/10ScSn) male mice were tested at 5 weeks and 11 weeks of age. The ABR thresholds to tone-burst stimuli at 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz were obtained for each ear and statistically compared (ANOVA) for potential group differences. RESULTS: Both mdx and mdx(Cv3) mice demonstrated normal ABR thresholds when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Both mdx and mdx(Cv3) mouse models have normal hearing by ABR. The authors' data suggest that dystrophin and its carboxyl terminus isoforms do not play a critical role in hearing in the mouse. This was unexpected, as previous studies using the brainstem auditory evoked response method suggested that the mdx mouse has an increased threshold for hearing.</text></passage></document><document><id>85</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of the NuRD subunits reveals a histone deacetylase core complex and a connection with DNA methylation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling and core histone acetylation and deacetylation represent mechanisms to alter nucleosome structure. NuRD is a multisubunit complex containing nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. The histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and the histone binding proteins RbAp48 and RbAp46 form a core complex shared between NuRD and Sin3-histone deacetylase complexes. The histone deacetylase activity of the core complex is severely compromised. A novel polypeptide highly related to the metastasis-associated protein 1, MTA2, and the methyl-CpG-binding domain-containing protein, MBD3, were found to be subunits of the NuRD complex. MTA2 modulates the enzymatic activity of the histone deacetylase core complex. MBD3 mediates the association of MTA2 with the core histone deacetylase complex. MBD3 does not directly bind methylated DNA but is highly related to MBD2, a polypeptide that binds to methylated DNA and has been reported to possess demethylase activity. MBD2 interacts with the NuRD complex and directs the complex to methylated DNA. NuRD may provide a means of gene silencing by DNA methylation.</text></passage></document><document><id>86</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus associated with a missense mutation encoding Gly23-->Val in neurophysin II. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( ADNDI ) is an inherited disease caused by progressive degeneration of the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus leading to decreased ability to produce the hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) .

A recent comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed frequent losses of chromosome 4 in breast carcinomas. In an effort to more precisely locate the putative tumor suppressor gene(s) on chromosome 4 involved in the pathogenesis of breast carcinomas, we performed loss of heterozygosity studies using 19 polymorphic microsatellite markers. After precise microdissection of archival surgical cases, we analyzed DNA obtained from 44 breast carcinomas for loss of heterozygosity. In addition, DNA from tumor cell lines derived from 14 of these 44 breast carcinomas were also analyzed. We observed deletions of chromosome 4 at multiple sites in both tumor cell lines and breast carcinomas. The deletions in cell lines and their corresponding tumors were extensive in nature, whereas they were more localized in noncultured breast carcinomas. The localized deletions in the noncultured breast carcinomas clearly defined four nonoverlapping regions of frequent deletions: 4q33-34 (76%); 4q25-26 (63%); 4p15.1-15.3 (57%); and 4p16.3 (50%).

Mutations at this locus cause a distinct autosomal recessive syndrome in homozygotes and predispose heterozygotes to cancer and coronary heart disease. Nine common neutral sequence variants were observed in the coding and splice junction regions of 132 chromosomes from Caucasian individuals of European origin. Each of these variants appeared frequently in both A-T and non-A-T chromosomes. However, there was remarkable linkage disequilibrium between the polymorphic loci, resulting in only 7 haplotypes in analyzed chromosomes. These 7 haplotypes fell into 3 major ancestral groups. No individual polymorphic variant or haplotype correlated reliably with the presence of an A-T mutation. Thus, comparing the frequency of neutral variants at the A-T locus in diseased and non-diseased populations is unlikely to uncover the relationship of mutations at this locus to common diseases. These data reflect general limitations on using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify loci for many common diseases.</text></passage></document><document><id>90</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Rearrangement of the neoplasia-associated gene HMGIC in synovia from patients with osteoarthritis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>The occurrence of clonal chromosome aberrations in short-term cultures from synovia, osteophytes, and cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) was recently reported.

Chromosomal abnormalities of 12q13-15 are frequent among malignant and benign mesenchymal tumors, and it was recently demonstrated that the molecular target in these neoplasms is the HMGIC gene. In this study, we show by fluorescence in situ hybridization that HMGIC was disrupted by rearrangements of 12q15 in synovia from two patients with OA. The finding of HMGIC rearrangement in a lesion that is not traditionally regarded as neoplastic not only widens the spectrum of disorders that may be associated with altered function of this gene, but also provides further support for the notion that genetically rearranged cell populations are part of the OA process.</text></passage></document><document><id>91</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Retrovirus-mediated WASP gene transfer corrects defective actin polymerization in B cell lines from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients carrying 'null' mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>161</offset><text>Boys affected with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) present with variable association of thrombocytopenia, eczema and immune deficiency.

The good success of HLA-matched BMT, however, makes WAS a potential candidate for hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. WAS patients carry mutations of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein gene encoding WASP, a 502-amino acid proline-rich protein with demonstrated involvement in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. To verify the feasibility of genetic correction for this disease, the WASP cDNA was expressed in EBV-immortalized B cell lines obtained from WAS patients using a retroviral vector. Transduced WAS cells showed levels of WASP expression similar to those found in cells from normal donors, without detectable effects on viability or growth characteristics. In addition, retrovirus-mediated expression of WASP led to improvement of cytoplasmic F-actin expression and formation of F-actin-positive microvilli, a process shown to be defective in untransduced WAS cell lines.

Cardiovascular disease is one of the most prevalent causes of death in DM patients. Electrophysiological studies in cardiac muscles from DM patients and from DMPK(-/-) mice suggested that DMPK is critical to the modulation of cardiac contractility and to the maintenance of proper cardiac conduction activity. However, there are no data regarding the molecular signaling pathways involved in DM heart failure. Here we show that DMPK expression in cardiac myocytes is highly enriched in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it colocalizes with the ryanodine receptor and phospholamban (PLN), a muscle-specific SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DMPK and PLN can physically associate. Furthermore, purified wild-type DMPK, but not a kinase-deficient mutant (K110A DMPK), phosphorylates PLN in vitro. Subsequent studies using the DMPK(-/-) mice demonstrated that PLN is hypo-phosphorylated in SR vesicles from DMPK(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Ca(2+) uptake in SR is impaired in ventricular homogenates from DMPK(-/-) mice. Together, our data suggest the existence of a novel regulatory DMPK pathway for cardiac contractility and provide a molecular mechanism for DM heart pathology.</text></passage></document><document><id>93</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Classification of IVS1-10T-->C as a polymorphism of BRCA1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>59</offset><text>Mutations inactivating the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 may be responsible for disease for up to 80% of familial ovarian cancer cases. In this syndrome, tumorigenesis classically initiates from an inherited mutation in one allele followed by somatic deletion of the normal allele. Sequencing of BRCA1 amplified from genomic DNA of lymphocytes and microdissected ovarian tumor cells of a familial ovarian cancer patient revealed three, rare heterozygous DNA variations (2418delA, 233G-->A, and IVS1-10T-->C) in both tumor and constitutional (lymphocyte) DNA. Thus, both copies of BRCA1 were retained in tumor. Haplotype analysis of the patient and four siblings assigned 2418delA to one copy of BRCA1 and 233G-->A and IVS1-10T-->C to the other. The DNA change, 2418delA, is considered a mutation that inactivated one BRCA1 allele because it caused a frameshift and generation of a premature stop codon, resulting in synthesis of a truncated peptide as evidenced by an in vitro protein truncation test. The DNA variation, 233G-->A, does not result in an amino acid change, and is considered a benign polymorphism. IVS1-10T-->C is a unique BRCA1 change that occurs in the last nucleotide of a consensus sequence for a branch site critical for RNA splicing. Therefore, we investigated whether IVS1-10T-->C deleteriously affected BRCA1 splicing or expression, and thereby inactivated the other BRCA1 allele. Using the technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with RNA isolated from lymphoid cell lines of the patient and of controls, no evidence was found that IVS1-10TC abnormally disrupted mRNA splicing or caused the absence of BRCA1 mRNA. Thus, IVS1-10T-->C is not harmful to BRCA1 function, and is classified a benign polymorphism. Retention of the normal BRCA1 allele in the tumor with the heterozygous germline BRCA1 mutation, 2418delA, indicated that mutational inactivation of both BRCA1 alleles was not required for tumorigenesis. It is possible that the normal allele may be functionally inactivated by a nonmutational mechanism.</text></passage></document><document><id>94</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Microcephaly, microphthalmia, congenital cataract, optic atrophy, short stature, hypotonia, severe psychomotor retardation, and cerebral malformations: a second family with micro syndrome or a new syndrome?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>207</offset><text>We report on four children of both sexes from a highly inbred family with hypotonia, spastic diplegia, microcephaly, microphthalmia, congenital cataract, optic atrophy, ptosis, kyphoscoliosis, short stature, severe mental retardation, and cerebral malformations.

Using this DNA fragment as a probe for Northern blot hybridization analysis, no evidence was found for expression of a unique RNA. Because of the lack of intron 1 sequence and the likely lack of expression, the new sequence is most probably a part of a VHL processed pseudogene. The putative pseudogene was mapped to human chromosome band 1q12 using the polymerase chain reaction with template DNA from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, a radiation hybrid panel, and a set of primers that were chosen to be maximally divergent from the genuine VHL gene. The human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs were then used on Southern blots to determine which human bands are from the pseudogene and which are from the functional gene.

Steady-state levels of FL-160 mRNA were 80 to 100-fold higher in trypomastigotes than in epimastigotes, yet transcription rates were equivalent between the lifecycle stages. Luciferase reporter constructs demonstrated that the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and intergenic region (IR) following the coding sequence of FL-160 was sufficient to generate 8-fold higher luciferase expression in trypomastigotes compared with epimastigotes. Transfection of 3' UTR/IR deletion constructs revealed cis-acting elements which conferred a trypomastigote-specific expression pattern similar to that of FL-160. Parasites treated with translation and transcription inhibitors, cyclohexamide and Actinomycin D, respectively, displayed a stage-specific pattern of FL-160 mRNA degradation. Epimastigotes, but not trypomastigotes, treated with the inhibitors accumulated a 1.4 Kb FL-160 cleavage product. The cleavage site mapped to a 31 base poly-purine tract in the FL-160 coding region. The first 526 aa of FL-160, containing the 31 base poly-purine tract and several smaller tracts, were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed from the T. cruzi tubulin locus. Stable transformants expressed 4-fold more FL-160:GFP fusion mRNA and 12-fold more fusion protein in the trypomastigote stage than in the epimastigote stage suggesting post-transcriptional and translational control elements. These data reveal at least two distinct control mechanisms for trypomastigote-specific expression of FL-160 surface glycoproteins, one involving the 3' UTR/IR and one involving the coding region of FL-160.</text></passage></document><document><id>98</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>TP53 mutation and haplotype analysis of two large African American families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>Two large apparently unrelated African American families with a high incidence of breast cancer and other tumors characteristic of Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome were studied. Mutation screening revealed that in both families the affected members carried a germline mutation of the TP53 gene at codon 133 (ATG--> ACG, M133T). In order to determine whether an ancestral haplotype was shared by these two families, polymorphic markers within and flanking the TP53 gene were studied. Haplotype analysis using five markers revealed an identical haplotype shared by the two families. Loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus in the probands' tumor tissues from each family was observed; in each case, the retained allele carried the common haplotype. The frequency of this haplotype in the general African American population is &lt;0.003. This unique haplotype, combined with the rare TP53 mutation, suggests that these African American families share a common ancestry. This finding suggests that other African Americans may be carriers of this mutation and thus may be at risk of early-onset breast cancer or other cancers characteristic of the Li-Fraumeni breast sarcoma cancer family syndrome. The finding of recurring mutations in African Americans may facilitate carrier screening and identification in this population.</text></passage></document><document><id>99</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of 12 novel mutations and two new polymorphisms in the arylsulfatase A gene: haplotype and genotype-phenotype correlation studies in Spanish metachromatic leukodystrophy patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>195</offset><text>Arylsulfatase A (ARSA) deficiency is the main cause of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), a lysosomal disorder with no specific treatment. In view of the importance of genetic counseling, analyses of mutations and polymorphisms, including the ARSA pseudodeficiency allele, were carried out in 18 unrelated Spanish MLD patients. A systematic search allowed us to identify 100% of the alleles involving 17 different mutations, 12 of which are novel: G32S, L68P, R84W, P94A, G99V, P136S, W193X, H227Y, R288H, G308D, T327I, and IVS6-12C-->G. Two new polymorphisms, 2033C>T and 2059C>T, were identified in intron 6 which, in combination with two polymorphisms previously described (2161C>G and 2213C>G), gave rise to four different haplotypes in the control population. In addition, we also studied polymorphism 842G>T. Linkage disequilibrium was detected between mutations IVS2+1G-->A, D255H, and T327I and specific haplotypes, suggesting a unique origin for these mutations. Moreover, mutation T327I was always associated with the T allele of the new rare variant A210A (893C>T). The distribution of mutation D255H (frequency 19.4%) among patients with different MLD clinical presentation revealed a clear genotype-phenotype correlation paralleling that reported for mutation IVS2+1G-->A (frequency 25%). Among the novel mutations, only P136S and R288H occurred on a background of the ARSA pseudodeficiency allele. Screening 182 normal chromosomes identified a frequency of 8.8% of this allele; moreover, we identified two unrelated subjects with the polyA- mutation in the absence of the N350S mutation, and this infrequent haplotype reinforced the heterogeneity of conditions with ARSA deficiency.</text></passage></document><document><id>100</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Inactivation of both alleles of the DPC4/SMAD4 gene in advanced colorectal cancers: identification of seven novel somatic mutations in tumors from Japanese patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>166</offset><text>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of loci on chromosome 18q occurs in a majority of colorectal cancers. The DPC4/SMAD4 gene, lying in close proximity to the DCC gene at 18q21.1, was recently identified as a candidate tumor suppressor for the genesis of pancreatic cancer as well as a predisposing gene for Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome (JPS). The gene product functions as a cytoplasmic mediator in the signaling pathway of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). To investigate the potential role of DPC4/SMAD4 gene in colorectal cancers, we examined 73 tumors of clinical stages II or III from Japanese patients, for LOH at 18q21 and also for subtle mutations anywhere within the coding region of DPC4/SMAD4. LOH was identified in 50 (78%) of the 64 tumors that were informative for polymorphic markers in the region. Somatic mutations were identified in seven of those tumors: two frameshift mutations, a 1-bp deletion (326 del T) in exon 8 and a 1-bp insertion (50-51 ins A) in exon 1; two nonsense mutations, Arg445Ter in exon 10 and Glu538Ter in exon 11; and three missense mutations, Asn129Lys in exon 2, Tyr95Asn in exon 2, and Asp355Glu in exon 8. Three of the seven mutations were observed in the mad homology 1 (MH1) domain encoded by exons 1 and 2. In all of the tumors carrying intragenic mutations of one allele, LOH analysis had shown that the other allele was missing. The results demonstrated that inactivation of both alleles of the DPC4/SMAD4 gene occurs in a substantial proportion of advanced colorectal cancers, and that the DPC4/SMAD4 gene probably exerts a tumor-suppressor effect for colorectal carcinogenesis that fulfills the criterion of the two-hit concept proposed by Knudson [A.G.

In this study, we investigated the role of VLCFA biosynthesis in X-ALD fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that elongation of both saturated and mono-unsaturated VLCFAs is enhanced in fibroblasts from patients with peroxisomal beta-oxidation defects including X-ALD, and peroxisome biogenesis disorders. These data indicate that enhanced VLCFA elongation is a general phenomenon associated with an impairment in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and not specific for X-ALD alone. Analysis of plasma samples from patients with X-ALD and different peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiencies revealed increased concentrations of VLCFAs up to 32 carbons. We infer that enhanced elongation does not result from impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation alone, but is due to the additional effect of unchecked chain elongation. We demonstrate that elongated VLCFAs are incorporated into complex lipids. The role of chain elongation was also studied retrospectively in samples from patients with X-ALD previously treated with "Lorenzo's oil." We found that the decrease in plasma C26:0 previously found is offset by the increase of mono-unsaturated VLCFAs, not measured previously during the trial. We conclude that evaluation of treatment protocols for disorders of peroxisomal beta-oxidation making use of plasma samples should include the measurement of saturated and unsaturated VLCFAs of chain lengths above 26 carbon atoms. We also conclude that chain elongation offers an interesting target to be studied as a possible mode of treatment for X-ALD and other peroxisomal beta-oxidation disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>102</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cloning of mouse prostaglandin transporter PGT cDNA: species-specific substrate affinities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>We recently identified and/or cloned the PG transporter PGT in the rat (rPGT) (Kanai, N., R.

Here we have cloned and expressed the mouse PGT (mPGT) cDNA. The tissue distribution of mPGT mRNA expression is significantly more restricted than that of rPGT and hPGT mRNA. Although the deduced amino acid sequence of mPGT is similar to the rat (91% identity) and human (82% identity) homologues, it has three regions of dissimilarity: amino acids 128-163 and 283-298, and valine 610 and isoleucine 611 (predicted to lie within putative transmembrane span 12). Affinities of hPGT, rPGT, and mPGT for several PG substrates differed, with hPGT having the highest [low Michaelis constant (K(m))] and mPGT the lowest affinity. A chimeric protein, linking the N-terminal domain of mPGT with the C-terminal domain of hPGT, had affinity for PGE2 indistinguishable from that of hPGT, indicating that the C-terminal domain dictates K(m). We mutagenized mouse valine 610 and isoleucine 611 to their corresponding human residues (methionine and glycine, respectively); however, these changes did not convert the inhibition constant of mPGT to that of hPGT. The mouse gene was localized to chromosome 9 in a region syntenic with the region of human chromosome 3 containing the hPGT gene. These studies highlight the species-dependence of tissue expression and function of PGT and lay the groundwork for the use of the mouse as a model system for the study of PGT function.</text></passage></document><document><id>103</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Comparative mapping of the DiGeorge region in the dog and exclusion of linkage to inherited canine conotruncal heart defects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>Conotruncal defects (CTDs) of the heart are a frequent component of DiGeorge, velocardiofacial, or other syndromes caused by deletions of the human chromosome 22q11 region (HSA22q11). In addition, some human patients with isolated nonsyndromic CTDs have been reported to have deletions of this region. Taken together, these findings lead to the conclusion that deletions of an HSA22q11 locus or loci produce abnormalities in cardiac development leading to CTDs. A spontaneous model of isolated inherited conotruncal malformations occurs in the keeshond dog. We have previously shown in experimental matings that nonsyndromic CTDs in the keeshond are inherited in a manner consistent with a major underlying locus. In the studies described in this article we tested two hypotheses: (1) the region of HSA22q11 commonly deleted in DiGeorge and related syndromes is evolutionarily conserved in the dog, and (2) a locus in this region is linked to hereditary CTD in the keeshond. Two loci within the minimal DiGeorge critical region (MDGCR) and two loci that lie telomeric to the MDGCR, one of which is commonly deleted in DiGeorge patients, were mapped in the dog using a combination of linkage analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The results confirm conserved synteny of the loci DGS-I, CTP, D22S788 (N41), and IGLC on the telomeric end of canine chromosome 26 (CFA26). The group of four syntenic gene loci, which spans a genetic distance of 2.5 cM is the first to be mapped to this small acrocentric canine chromosome and adds gene-associated polymorphic markers to the developing dog linkage map. Linkage of loci in this region to hereditary CTD in the keeshond was excluded.</text></passage></document><document><id>104</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Photoreceptor layer reconstruction in a rodent model of retinal degeneration.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>We have examined the potential of retinal cell transplantation to dystrophic retinal degeneration mice as a way of replacing photoreceptors lost because of an intrinsic genetic defect.

Cystinuria is very common among Jews of Libyan ancestry living in Israel. Previously we have shown that the disease-causing gene in Libyan Jews maps to an 8-cM interval on chromosome 19q between the markers D19S409 and D19S208. Several markers from chromosome 19q showed strong linkage disequilibrium, and a specific haplotype was found in more than half of the carrier chromosomes. In this study we have analyzed Libyan Jewish cystinuria families with eight markers from within the interval containing the gene. Seven of these markers showed significant linkage disequilibrium. A common haplotype was found in 16 of the 17 carrier chromosomes. Analysis of historical recombinants placed the gene in a 1.8-Mb interval between the markers D19S430 and D19S874. Two segments of the historical carrier chromosome used to calculate the mutation's age revealed that the disease-causing mutation was introduced into this population 7-16 generations ago.</text></passage></document><document><id>106</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Trocar implantation metastasis after laparoscopy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer: can the risk be reduced?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>116</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors for trocar implantation metastasis after diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with primary or recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-three women with primary advanced ovarian cancer and 21 women with recurrent ovarian cancer undergoing a laparoscopy for a tissue diagnosis and for assessment of operability were included in the study. The occurrence of implantation metastasis at the trocar incision scars was analyzed according to clinicopathologic characteristics. RESULTS: A recurrence developed at the trocar site in 7 (58%) of 12 patients undergoing a laparoscopy in which only the skin was closed at the end of the procedure and in 2 (2%) of 92 patients undergoing a laparoscopy with closure of all layers (odds ratio, 63; 95% confidence interval, 10.3-385; P &lt;.001). The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage at initial presentation, tumor histologic type, tumor differentiation, maximal tumor diameter at the time of diagnosis, estimated weight of the metastatic tumor, residual tumor after cytoreductive surgery, surgical characteristics, and type of chemotherapy were well balanced among both groups. Patients with implantation metastasis had significantly more ascites (median, 700 mL vs 300 mL; P =.032) and a longer interval between the start of platinum-based chemotherapy or cytoreductive surgery (median, 6 days vs 17 days; P &lt;.01) compared with patients without abdominal wall recurrence. A palpable abdominal wall metastasis developed in none of the patients undergoing a laparoscopy with closure of all layers of the abdomen followed by cytoreductive surgery or chemotherapy within 1 week after the laparoscopy. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with abdominal wall implantation metastasis had a survival rate similar to that of the other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy with careful closure of the peritoneum, rectus sheath, and skin followed by chemotherapy or cytoreductive surgery with excision of the trocar trajectories within 1 week is safe in patients with disseminated ovarian cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>107</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Use of protamine to augment adenovirus-mediated cancer gene therapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>Improving the therapeutic potential of adenoviral (Ad) suicide gene therapy has become an area of intense investigation since the inception of gene therapy strategies for cancer treatment. Poor efficiency of gene transfer to target tissues has become one of the most important limitations to Ad-based gene therapy. Since polycations have been shown to enhance adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo, we hypothesized that polycations could augment treatment efficacy in animals with established tumor. To address this hypothesis, protamine sulfate, a polycation already safely administered in humans, was complexed with a recombinant Ad (E1E3-deleted) vector containing the herpes simplex 1 thymidine kinase (HSVtk) suicide gene to treat cancer cell lines in vitro and in animals bearing intraperitoneal tumor. In the presence of 5 microg/ml protamine, the efficiency of gene transfer to a number of cancer cell lines normally resistant to adenovirus was significantly enhanced. Protamine's effect in vitro was found to be inversely proportional to the level of expression of the high affinity Ad binding site, coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), on the sur- face of the various cell lines tested. Ad.tk infected tumor cells were rendered 2.5- to three-fold more sensitive to 20 microM ganciclovir (GCV) in the presence of protamine. Protamine also augmented the in vivo transfer efficiency of the marker gene, LacZ (contained in an Ad vector), on the surface of tumors derived from an intraperitoneal mouse model. Quantitative imaging revealed 50% tumor surface transduced with LacZ when treatment was performed in the presence of 50 microg/ml protamine compared with 12% tumor surface in controls. However, experiments performed utilizing intraperitoneal administration of Ad.tk/GCV in the presence or absence of 50 microg/ml protamine demonstrated no significantly improved median survival in mice bearing established intraperitoneal tumors. Similarly, in Fischer rats bearing intrapleural tumor, no improvement in anti-tumor response was observed when Ad treatment was performed intrapleurally in the presence of protamine. Thus, although protamine induced an enhancement of Ad-mediated gene transfer in vitro and in vivo, its use as an adjunct to intracavitary Ad-based cancer gene therapy in vivo appears to be limited.</text></passage></document><document><id>108</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Multiple roles for activated LEF/TCF transcription complexes during hair follicle development and differentiation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>LEF/TCF DNA-binding proteins act in concert with activated beta -catenin, the product of Wnt signaling, to transactivate downstream target genes. To probe the role of activated LEF/TCF transcription factor complexes in hair follicle morphogenesis and differentiation, we engineered mice harboring TOPGAL, a beta -galactosidase gene under the control of a LEF/TCF and beta -catenin inducible promoter. In mice, TOPGAL expression was directly stimulated by a stabilized form of beta -catenin, but was also dependent upon LEF1/TCF3 in skin. During embryogenesis, TOPGAL activation occurred transiently in a subset of LEF1-positive cells of pluripotent ectoderm and underlying mesenchyme. Downgrowth of initiated follicles proceeded in the absence of detectable TOPGAL expression, even though LEF1 was still expressed. While proliferative matrix cells expressed the highest levels of Lef1 mRNAs, LEF1 concentrated in the precursor cells to the hair shaft, where TOPGAL expression was co-induced with hair-specific keratin genes containing LEF/TCF-binding motifs. LEF1 and TOPGAL expression ceased during catagen and telogen, but reappeared at the start of the postnatal hair cycle, concomitant with precortex formation. In contrast to hair shaft precursor cells, postnatal outer root sheath expressed TCF3, but not TOPGAL. TCF3 was also expressed in the putative follicle stem cells, and while TOPGAL was generally silent in this compartment, it was stimulated at the start of the hair cycle in a fashion that appeared to be dependent upon stabilization of beta -catenin. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that LEF1/TCF3 is necessary but not sufficient for TOPGAL activation, revealing the existence of positive and negative regulators of these factors in the skin. Furthermore, our findings unveil the importance of activated LEF/TCF complexes at distinct times in hair development and cycling when changes in cell fate and differentiation commitments take place.</text></passage></document><document><id>109</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 2 and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome: a case for "lumping". </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>Recent studies demonstrated the existence of a genetically distinct , usually lethal form of the Schwartz-Jampel syndrome ( SJS ) of myotonia and skeletal dysplasia , which we called SJS type 2 .

These complications are preceded by years of iron accumulation, and most are believed to be preventable by removal of excess iron by phlebotomy. Thus, early identification and treatment - the quintessential functions of health screening - seem to make sense for HH. However, the available screening tests are imperfect. While they can identify many persons at increased risk from HH, the proportion that will develop serious clinical manifestations related to iron overload is not known with certainty.

In this study, the structure and location of the murine thrombospondin-4 gene and the location of the human thrombospondin-4 gene are reported. The murine thrombospondin-4 gene is approximately 4.5 kb in length and includes 22 exons. Interspecific backcross analysis of progeny derived from matings of (C57BL/6J x Mus spretus)F(1) x C57BL/6J mice indicates that the thrombospondin-4 gene is tightly linked to the Dhfr locus on murine Chromosome (Chr) 13. The human gene maps to Chr 5 in band q13 by in situ hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes. The thrombospondin-4 promoter is similar to promoters of some housekeeping, growth control, and other thrombospondin genes in that it contains multiple GC box sequences and lacks a CAAT box. The presence of multiple E-box sequence motifs is consistent with thrombospondin-4 expression in muscle and bone tissue.</text></passage></document><document><id>112</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fusion of TEL/ETV6 to a novel ACS2 in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia with t(5;12)(q31;p13).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>We identified a novel human long fatty acyl CoA synthetase 2 gene, ACS2, as a new ETV6 fusion partner gene in a recurrent t(5;12)(q31;p13) translocation in a patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) with basophilia, a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with eosinophilia, and a patient with acute eosinophilic leukemia (AEL). ACS2 is expressed in the brain and bone marrow and is highly conserved in man and rats. The resulting ETV6/ACS2 fusion transcripts showed an out-frame fusion of exon 1 of ETV6 to exon 1 of ACS2 in the AEL case, an out-frame fusion of exon 1 of ETV6 to exon 11 of ACS2 in the AML case, and a short in-frame fusion of ETV6 exon 1 to the 3' untranslated region of ACS2 in the RAEB case.

In addition to this late requirement, vHNF1 may play earlier roles during development, as it is first expressed in the visceral endoderm at the onset of gastrulation. In order to shed light on its function during embryogenesis, we have inactivated the murine gene by homologous recombination. The homozygous mutation results in embryonic lethality by day 7.5 of development and vHNF1(-)(/)(-) embryos display a disorganized visceral endoderm and a significantly reduced size. Studies of ES cell differentiation and aggregation with tetraploid morulae establish that vHNF1 expression is essential for visceral endoderm differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of differentiation markers confirms that vHNF1 is part of a genetic network that directs the expression of HNF4 and downstream endodermal genes. Furthermore, the complementation of the mutant embryos with wild-type visceral endoderm rescues the day 7.5 lethality and reveals an additional phenotype linked to vHNF1 later expression. The examination of chimeric embryos suggests that vHNF1 expression might be cell-autonomously required in the gut for the proper morphogenesis of the embryo.</text></passage></document><document><id>115</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nucleotide sequence of exon 2 to 4 of the R-ras gene in the hermaphroditic fish Rivulus marmoratus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>We have cloned the ras homologue from the mangrove rivulus (Rivulus marmoratus) after low-stringency plaque hybridization of the mangrove rivulus genomic DNA library.

In order to determine the effect of in vivo hyperinsulinemia on these processes, we determined apoB mRNA editing, apobec-1 expression, hepatic expression of mRNA for apoB and other VLDL apoproteins, and the quantity and composition of plasma VLDL in the hyperinsulinemic fatty Zucker rat. Total apoB mRNA content of the livers of the fatty rats and lean littermates did not differ; however, edited apoB message coding for hepatic apo B48, and abundance of mRNA for the catalytic subunit of the apoB mRNA editing complex, apobec-1, was increased by 1.7- and 3.3-fold, respectively, in fatty rats. ApoCIII mRNA abundance was increased in livers of fatty rats as well, but the abundance of hepatic apoE mRNA in the fatty animal was not different from that of the lean rat. Hepatic apoAI mRNA abundance was also increased in the fatty rats. Associated with increased apoB mRNA editing, was the 1.7-fold increase in the fraction of apoB in plasma as apoB48 in fatty rats. VLDL-triglyceride and -apoB in plasma were 15- and 3-fold higher, respectively, in fatty Zucker rats compared to lean littermates, indicating both enrichment of VLDL with triglycerides and increased accumulation of VLDL particles. Increased hepatic expression of mRNA for apoCIII and apoAI was associated with increased content of apoC (and relative depletion of apoE) in VLDL of fatty rats, and plasma apoAI was increased in fatty Zucker rats, primarily in the HDL fraction. The current study provides further evidence that chronic exposure to high levels of insulin influences both the quantity of and lipid/apoprotein composition of VLDL in plasma. The increased apoC and decreased apoE (as well as increased triglyceride) content of VLDL in the fatty Zucker rat observed in the current study may affect VLDL clearance and therefore may be a factor in the observed accumulation of VLDL in the plasma of the fatty hyperinsulinemic Zucker rats.</text></passage></document><document><id>120</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sensing of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage by ATM through interaction with histone deacetylase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>102</offset><text>The ATM gene is mutated in individuals with ataxia telangiectasia, a human genetic disease characterized by extreme sensitivity to radiation.

Binding and immunoprecipitation assays have now shown that ATM interacts with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 both in vitro and in vivo, and that the extent of this association is increased after exposure of MRC5CV1 human fibroblasts to ionizing radiation. Histone deacetylase activity was also detected in immunoprecipitates prepared from these cells with antibodies to ATM, and this activity was blocked by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A.

The PTEN structure reveals a phosphatase domain that is similar to protein phosphatases but has an enlarged active site important for the accommodation of the phosphoinositide substrate. The structure also reveals that PTEN has a C2 domain. The PTEN C2 domain binds phospholipid membranes in vitro, and mutation of basic residues that could mediate this reduces PTEN's membrane affinity and its ability to suppress the growth of glioblastoma tumor cells. The phosphatase and C2 domains associate across an extensive interface, suggesting that the C2 domain may serve to productively position the catalytic domain on the membrane.</text></passage></document><document><id>124</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Image analysis of p53 and cyclin D1 expression in premalignant lesions of the oral mucosa.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: The expression of p53 and cyclin D1 proteins was analyzed by image analysis in oral premalignant lesions and normal oral mucosa. STUDY DESIGN: Punch biopsies from the normal oral mucosa were obtained from 20 normal donors and 41 patients with oral dysplastic leukoplakias. After controlled formaldehyde fixation and paraffin embedding, immunohistochemistry was used to detect cyclin D1 and p53. Image analysis was performed using stain intensity levels established by determining color thresholds (nuclear score) in the basal and parabasal layers. RESULTS: Analysis of sections showed a similar pattern: only two normal donors had a few intensely positive p53 cells in the basal layer of the floor of the mouth and the tongue epithelia. Similarly, only three donors had intensely positive cyclin D1 cells in the normal epithelia of the same sites. Most cells fell in the range of negative or marginal stain (lower quartiles or terciles of nuclear score). These data on normal mucosa were compared with low grade oral leukoplakias (LGD) with mild to moderate dysplasia and with high grade leukoplakias (HGD) with severe dysplasia. Both markers were differentially expressed in precursor lesions versus normal epithelia. Statistical analysis of our data shows that the intensity of the immunohistochemical stain, as reflected in the nuclear scores of p53, is a reliable parameter that can differentiate between LGD and HGD of the oral mucosa. This was especially true when higher nuclear scores were compared. In contrast, low nuclear scores are more effective in differentiating normal epithelia from dysplastic epithelia. Although cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry does not stain as intensely as p53 stain, similar conclusions can be derived from those data. CONCLUSION: Image analysis of these two markers proved useful in distinguishing normal oral epithelia from low grade and high grade leukoplakias. With further developments in this field it is hoped that image analysis procedures could be used in different types of studies in which variations of protein expression in tissue sections could have prognostic implications or could be useful to determine subtle effects of curative or preventive treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>125</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Interstitial 4p deletion in a child with an Angelman syndrome-like phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset></passage></document><document><id>126</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Large-scale analysis of differential gene expression in the hindlimb muscles and diaphragm of mdx mouse.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>The mdx mouse is an animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is caused by the absence of dystrophin.

An 85 kb genomic sequence located in the proximal region of the map was analyzed for putative exons. Four pseudogenes were found, including psiIGSF3, psiEIF3, psiGCT-rel whose functional copies map to chromosome 1p13, chromosome 2 and chromosome 22q11, respectively. The TTLL1 pseudogene corresponds to a new gene whose functional copy maps to chromosome 22q13. Ten gene fragments represent novel sequences that have related sequences on different human chromosomes and show 97-100% nucleotide identity to chromosome 21. These may correspond to pseudogenes on chromosome 21 and to functional genes in other chromosomes. The 85 kb genomic sequence was analyzed also for GC content, CpG islands, and repetitive sequence distribution. A GC-poor L isochore spanning 40 kb from satellite 1 was observed in the most centromeric region, next to a GC-rich H isochore that is a candidate region for the presence of functional genes. The pericentric duplication of a 7.8 kb region that is derived from the 22q13 chromosome band is described. We showed that the juxta-centromeric region of human chromosome 21 is enriched for retrotransposed pseudogenes and gene fragments transferred by interchromosome duplications, but we do not rule out the possibility that the region harbors functional genes also.</text></passage></document><document><id>128</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product interacts with Sp1 to repress vascular endothelial growth factor promoter activity. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene ( VHL ) has a critical role in the pathogenesis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , as VHL mutations have been found in both von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated and sporadic RCCs .

One hundred eleven men with African American ancestry were tested for G6PD deficiency (Type A-202/376) and for the cytokine gene promoter polymorphisms of IL-10 (-1082 G/A, -819 T/C, and -592 A/C), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (-308 G/A), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (C/T codon 10 and C/G codon 25), IL-6 (-174 G/C), and interferon (IFN)-gamma (+874 A/T). There were no differences in the allele frequencies for TNF-alpha, IL-6, or TGF-beta1 between the G6PD-deficient and nondeficient population. In contrast, the low-producing IL-10 alleles (-592A) and low-producing IFN-gamma (+874A) allele frequencies were greater in G6PD-deficient than nondeficient samples (P = 0.035 and 0.009). Seventy-one percent of G6PD-deficient and 50% of nondeficient samples carried the high-producing IL-6(G) allele with low-producing IL-10(A) allele (P = 0.03). Furthermore, 95% of deficient and 81% of nondeficient samples carried the IL-6(G) allele together with low-producing IFN-gamma(A) allele (P = 0.017). These investigations indicate a predominant presence of high-producing IL-6 alleles together with low-producing IL-10 and IFN-gamma alleles in individuals with ancestry from malaria-endemic regions. The frequency of low-producing IL-10 genotypes is greater in the G6PD-deficient compared with nondeficient patients. The fact that these genetic differences are preserved in the current African American G6PD-deficient population indicates their potential role in pathophysiological processes in the absence of the selective pressure caused by tropical diseases.</text></passage></document><document><id>130</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>HFE downregulates iron uptake from transferrin and induces iron-regulatory protein activity in stably transfected cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal-recessive disorder of iron metabolism.

A previously identified interaction of HFE and the transferrin receptor suggests a possible regulatory role of HFE in cellular iron absorption. Using an HeLa cell line stably transfected with HFE under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter, we investigated the effect of HFE expression on cellular iron uptake. We demonstrate that the overproduction of HFE results in decreased iron uptake from diferric transferrin. Moreover, HFE expression activates the key regulators of intracellular iron homeostasis, the iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs), implying that HFE can affect the intracellular "labile iron pool." The increase in IRP activity is accompanied by the downregulation of the iron-storage protein, ferritin, and an upregulation of transferrin receptor levels. These findings are discussed in the context of the pathophysiology of HH and a possible role of iron-responsive element (IRE)-containing mRNAs.</text></passage></document><document><id>131</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of the role of heat shock protein (Hsp) molecular chaperones in polyglutamine disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>Polyglutamine (polygln) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation.

We further demonstrate that expression of expanded polygln protein elicits a stress response in cells as manifested by marked induction of Hsp70. Studies of SCA3/MJD disease brain confirm these findings, showing localization of Hsp40 and, less commonly, Hsp70 chaperones to intranuclear ataxin-3 aggregates. In transfected cells, overexpression of either of two Hsp40 chaperones, the DNAJ protein homologs HDJ-1 and HDJ-2, suppresses aggregation of truncated or full-length mutant ataxin-3. Finally, we extend these studies to a PC12 neural model of polygln toxicity in which we demonstrate that overexpression of HDJ-1 suppresses polygln aggregation with a parallel decrease in toxicity. These results suggest that expanded polygln protein induces a stress response and that specific molecular chaperones may aid the handling of misfolded or aggregated polygln protein in neurons.

METHODS: Quantitative fluorescent multiplex PCR (QFM-PCR) involves amplification of the promoter region and all 27 exons of the RB1 gene with fluorescein labeled primers in multiplex sets. Primers were divided into multiplex sets of three to seven pairs of primers, also contained were internal control primers C4. Four external controls were also tested by using nullisomic, monosomic, diploid, and trisomic for RB1. The number of copies of a fragment in a test sample was calculated by comparing fluorescence intensity of the fragment with these standards. Fragment value detection and subsequent calculations were performed automatically by Fragment Manager 2.1 Software. RESULTS: Small deletions, insertions and whole exon deletion in the RB1 gene were detected from genomic DNA. Sequencing analysis and RB tumor homozygous mutation comfirmed the defects detected by QFM-PCR. CONCLUSION: The approach is a rapid, cost-effective initial method for screening patient samples. It has been used to identify approximately 50% positives of tested samples. The mutations shown were not only small deletion and insertion, but also the single copy exons heterozygous mutation in the RB1 gene which the previously used methods were unable to detect.

This recessively inherited disorder, similar in many respects to Wilson disease, is of particular interest because the canine Atp7b gene, homologous to ATP7B defective in Wilson disease, is not responsible for canine copper toxicosis as has been expected. Atox1, a copper chaperone delivering copper to Atp7b, therefore became a potential candidate. We cloned canine Atox1, which shows conserved motifs of the copper-binding domain (MTCXXC) and of the lysine-rich region (KTGK), and showed 88, 80, and 41% amino acid sequence identity with the orthologous mouse, human, and yeast proteins. No gross deletions of Atox1 could be identified in the affected Bedlington terriers by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA. The canine Atox1 gene spans about 4 kb, with a 204-bp open reading frame cDNA contained within two exons. Sequence analysis of the coding regions, including intron/exon boundaries, showed no mutations in Atox1 from genomic DNA of an affected dog. We have also identified an apparently nontranscribed canine Atox1 pseudogene, with 12 sequence changes and no intron. Mapping of Atox1 and a marker closely linked to the canine copper toxicosis locus indicated lack of synteny. Atox1 is therefore excluded as a candidate gene for canine copper toxicosis, indicating that some other unidentified gene must be responsible for this copper storage disease in dogs and also suggesting the possibility of a similar gene responsible for a copper storage disease in humans.</text></passage></document><document><id>135</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Peripheral neuropathy caused by proteolipid protein gene mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a dysmyelinating disorder of the central nervous system typically caused by duplications or missense mutations of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene.

The three affected individuals in the two families were born to non-consanguineous parents and had an early onset bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. In both families, differing SSCP patterns were observed in affected and unaffected individuals. Sequence analysis in both families demonstrated an in-frame 3 bp deletion (423-425delATT) in one allele, which leads to the loss of an isoleucine residue at codon 141, and a 423A-->G transversion in the other allele, which creates an Ile-->Val substitution at codon 141 (I141V). Neither of these two mutations was detected in DNA from 100 unrelated control subjects. The altered isoleucine residue lies within the third conserved alpha-helical transmembrane domain (M3), which is critical for the formation of the wall of the gap junction pore. Both the deletion of the isoleucine residue 141 and its substitution to valine in the two families could alter the structure of M3, and impair the function of the gap junction. The present data demonstrate that, like mutations in connexin26, mutations in Cx31 can lead to both recessive and dominant forms of non-syndromic deafness.</text></passage></document><document><id>137</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Orofaciodigital syndrome, type I: a phenotypic and genetic analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>An additional family with the orofaciodigital syndrome.

For many years, Ham's test has been essential for diagnostic testing of erythrocytes for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. We present a 3-colour flowcytometry method used for quantification of CD59-negative erythrocytes and CD55/CD59-negative leukocytes. The results from analysis of blood samples from six patients suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and six healthy blood donors, using the flowcytometry method, Ham's test and a microtyping gelcard method are compared. Our flow cytometric method, using directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies to test both erythrocytes and leukocytes, is the most sensitive method. It is specific and delivers fast results.

The upstream breakpoint is in intron 1, 18. 8 kb 3' of exon 1; the downstream breakpoint lies 10.5 kb past the final aggrecan exon 18. The deletion is flanked by sequences homologous to topoisomerase I and II cleavage sites and a 7-bp direct repeat, suggesting the defect resulted from a nonhomologous recombination event. Additionally, the size of the first intron and the intron-exon structure between exons 12 and 14 were determined, establishing the length of the murine aggrecan gene as 68.6 kb.

Down-regulation of Ce-lamin causes embryonic lethality. Abnormalities include rapid changes in nuclear morphology during interphase, inability of cells to complete mitosis, abnormal condensation of chromatin, clustering of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), and missing or abnormal germ cells. Ce-emerin and Ce-MAN1 are both embedded in the inner nuclear membrane, and both bind Ce-lamin and Ce-BAF; in addition, both require Ce-lamin for their localization. Mutations in human emerin cause X-linked recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. In C. elegans, loss of Ce-emerin alone has no detectable phenotype, while loss of 90% Ce-MAN1 causes approximately 15% embryonic lethality. However in worms that lack Ce-emerin, a approximately 90% reduction of Ce-MAN1 is lethal to all embryos by the 100-cell stage, with a phenotype involving chromatin condensation and repeated cycles of anaphase chromosome bridging and cytokinesis. The anaphase-bridged chromatin retained a mitosis-specific phosphohistone H3 epitope, and failed to recruit detectable Ce-lamin or Ce-BAF. Down-regulation of Ce-BAF showed similar phenotypes. These findings suggest that lamin, LEM-domain proteins and BAF are part of a lamina network essential for chromatin organization and cell division, and that Ce-emerin and Ce-MAN1 share at least one and possibly multiple overlapping functions, which may be relevant to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.</text></passage></document><document><id>142</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Four years analysis of cancer genetic clinics activity in France from 1994 to 1997: a survey on 801 patients.

METHOD: A questionnaire was sent to all the 29 French non-specialized cancer genetic clinics to evaluate activity during a period of 4 consecutive weeks each year from 1994 to 1997. Items concerning the cancer genetic clinics, the consultees and the types of consultation were explored. RESULTS: A total number of 801 consultees were seen during the period of analysis. Some prominent characteristics of patients attending cancer genetic clinics were found. The majority of these are women (88%), and the mean age of consultees is 48 years. Fifty five percent of consultees are affected with cancer, and breast (personal and/or family history) is the most frequent site involved (63%). A genetic predisposition is certain or likely in about 53% of cases and unlikely in only 13% of consultations. The majority of consultations are devoted to new families (71%). The mean duration of consultations is 50 minutes, but 40% have a duration of at least 1 hour. Variations of several parameters during the 4 years period were observed and analyzed. Finally, since duration of consultations (more or equal to 1 hour) and personal or family history of breast/ovarian cancer appeared as pivotal elements in our study and consequently may affect the organization of clinics and the structuring as well as the evolution of cancer genetic activity in France, we analyzed more precisely the factors significantly associated with these 2 elements. CONCLUSION: Study compliance was fair (60% of centers) and these results give a good measure of cancer genetic activity in France. The variation of parameters from one year to another may reflect modifications in medical practice (medical orientation rather than research focus and content of cancer genetic clinics) and/or scientific breakthroughs in cancer genetics such as identification of genes predisposing to cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>143</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein corrects dysfunctional high density lipoproteins and reduces aortic atherosclerosis in lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase transgenic mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>176</offset><text>Expression of human lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in mice (LCAT-Tg) leads to increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels but paradoxically, enhanced atherosclerosis. We have hypothesized that the absence of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in LCAT-Tg mice facilitates the accumulation of dysfunctional HDL leading to impaired reverse cholesterol transport and the development of a pro-atherogenic state. To test this hypothesis we cross-bred LCAT-Tg with CETP-Tg mice. On both regular chow and high fat, high cholesterol diets, expression of CETP in LCAT-Tg mice reduced total cholesterol (-39% and -13%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05), reflecting a decrease in HDL cholesterol levels. CETP normalized both the plasma clearance of [(3)H]cholesteryl esters ([(3)H]CE) from HDL (fractional catabolic rate in days(-1): LCAT-Tg = 3.7 +/- 0.34, LCATxCETP-Tg = 6.1 +/- 0.16, and controls = 6.4 +/- 0.16) as well as the liver uptake of [(3)H]CE from HDL (LCAT-Tg = 36%, LCATxCETP-Tg = 65%, and controls = 63%) in LCAT-Tg mice. On the pro-atherogenic diet the mean aortic lesion area was reduced by 41% in LCATxCETP-Tg (21.2 +/- 2.0 micrometer(2) x 10(3)) compared with LCAT-Tg mice (35.7 +/- 2.0 micrometer(2) x 10(3); p &lt; 0.001). Adenovirus-mediated expression of scavenger receptor class B (SR-BI) failed to normalize the plasma clearance and liver uptake of [(3)H]CE from LCAT-Tg HDL. Thus, the ability of SR-BI to facilitate the selective uptake of CE from LCAT-Tg HDL is impaired, indicating a potential mechanism leading to impaired reverse cholesterol transport and atherosclerosis in these animals. We conclude that CETP expression reduces atherosclerosis in LCAT-Tg mice by restoring the functional properties of LCAT-Tg mouse HDL and promoting the hepatic uptake of HDL-CE. These findings provide definitive in vivo evidence supporting the proposed anti-atherogenic role of CETP in facilitating HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport and demonstrate that CETP expression is beneficial in pro-atherogenic states that result from impaired reverse cholesterol transport.</text></passage></document><document><id>144</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The hybrid PAX3-FKHR fusion protein of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma transforms fibroblasts in culture. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is characterized by a chromosomal translocation that fuses parts of the PAX3 and FKHR genes .

Colonic polyps early in the tumor progression pathway showed similar numbers of events. These results indicate that, as with certain hereditary cancer syndromes, genomic destabilization is an early step in sporadic tumor development. Together these results support the model of genomic instability being a cause rather than an effect of malignancy, facilitating vastly accelerated somatic cell evolution, with the observed orderly steps of the colon cancer progression pathway reflecting the consequences of natural selection.</text></passage></document><document><id>147</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular defects leading to human complement component C6 deficiency in an African-American family. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>Complement component C6 deficiency ( C6D ) was diagnosed in a 16-year-old African-American male with meningococcal meningitis .

The channel is localized on the plasma membrane where it controls the flow of Na+ and Ca2+ into the outer segment in response to light-induced changes in cGMP. The rod channel consists of two homologous subunits, designated alpha and beta, which assemble into a heterotetrameric complex. Both subunits contain a core structural unit consisting of six transmembrane segments, a pore region and a cGMP binding domain. The alpha subunit is the dominant functional subunit since it forms a functional channel by itself. The beta subunit does not assemble into a functional channel by itself, but modulates the activity of the channel. The peripherin/rds-rom-1 complex is localized along the rim region of disk membranes where it plays a crucial role in disk morphogenesis. This complex consists of two peripherin/rds and two rom-1 subunits that interact non-covalently to form a heterotetramer. Peripherin/rds is the dominant subunit since, in the absence of rom-1, it self-assembles into a homotetramer that effectively supports outer segment disk formation and structure. Rom-1 on its own does not initiate outer segment formation. Instead, it plays a minor role in fine tuning disk structure. Recently, peripherin/rds-containing tetramers have been shown to form disulfide-mediated higher-order oligomers. This novel oligomerization is suggested to play a central role in outer segment disk formation.</text></passage></document><document><id>149</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Gastric and duodenal polyps in Smad4 (Dpc4) knockout mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>59</offset><text>The SMAD4 (DPC4) gene was initially isolated as a candidate tumor suppressor from the convergent site of homozygous deletions on 18q in a panel of pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. It encodes a common cytoplasmic signaling molecule shared by the transforming growth factor-beta, activin, and bone morphogenic pathways. We recently inactivated its mouse homologue Smad4 and demonstrated its role in the malignant progression of benign adenomas to invasive adenocarcinomas by analyzing mice with Apc and Smad4 compound mutations. Although simple Smad4 homozygotes were embryonically lethal, the heterozygotes were fertile and appeared normal up to the age of 1 year. Upon further investigation, however, they have developed inflammatory polyps in the glandular stomach and duodenum. By PCR genotyping and immunohistochemical staining, the wild-type Smad4 allele has been lost in the polyp epithelial cells, ie., loss of heterozygosity. On the other hand, we have not found any mutations in such genes as K-Ras, H-Ras, N-Ras, p53, or PTEN. Histologically, the polyps are similar to human juvenile polyps showing moderate stromal cell proliferation and infiltrations by eosinophils and plasma cells. In addition, foci of adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells are also found. These results are consistent with a recent report that germ-line SMAD4 mutations are found in a subset of familial juvenile polyposis.</text></passage></document><document><id>150</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Androgen receptor gene mutations in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>Prostate cancer is considered to be one of the most hormone-dependent human malignancies. As a key mediator of hormonal response, the androgen receptor (AR) is believed to have an important role in the progression of prostate cancer. Mutations in the coding region of the AR gene have been found in both untreated and hormone-refractory prostate cancer, but the frequency of such mutations at different stages of the disease is poorly documented and even contradictory results have been published. In the present study, the frequency of AR gene mutations was determined in 30 locally recurrent and two metastatic hormone-refractory prostate tumours using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), non-radioactive single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and sequencing. The length of the polymorphic CAG repeat, which is inversely correlated with the ability of the AR to activate transcription, was also analysed as well as the GGC repeat. Twelve samples were known to contain an AR gene amplification. Altogether, one point mutation (Gly(674)-->Ala) and one microsatellite mutation (CAG(20)-->CAG(18)) were found, both in cancers containing the AR gene amplification. The mean lengths of the polymorphic CAG and GGC repeats were similar to those observed in the normal population. These results favour the view that mutations in the AR gene are rare in hormone-refractory prostate cancer and do not play an important role, at least, in local relapse. Instead, the amplification and consequent overexpression of the wild-type AR gene seem to be the most common alteration involving the AR in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>151</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA in carrier males: a new mechanism of involvement in the fragile-X syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>Fragile-X syndrome is a trinucleotide-repeat-expansion disorder in which the clinical phenotype is believed to result from transcriptional silencing of the fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene as the number of CGG repeats exceeds approximately 200. For premutation alleles ( approximately 55-200 repeats), no abnormalities in FMR1-gene expression have been described, despite growing evidence of clinical involvement in premutation carriers. To address this (apparent) paradox, we have determined, for 16 carrier males (55-192 repeats), the relative levels of leukocyte FMR1 mRNA, by use of automated fluorescence-detection reverse transcriptase-PCR, and the percent of lymphocytes that are immunoreactive for FMR1 protein (FMRP). For some alleles with>100 repeats, there was a reduction in the number of FMRP-positive cells. Unexpectedly, FMR1 mRNA levels were elevated at least fivefold within this same range. No significant increase in FMR1 mRNA stability was observed in a lymphoblastoid cell line (160 repeats) derived from one of the carrier males, suggesting that the increased message levels are due to an increased rate of transcription. Current results support a mechanism of involvement in premutation carriers, in which reduced translational efficiency is at least partially compensated through increased transcriptional activity. Thus, diminished translational efficiency may be important throughout much of the premutation range, with a mechanistic switch occurring in the full-mutation range as the FMR1 gene is silenced.</text></passage></document><document><id>152</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Checkpoint gene linked to human cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>40</offset></passage></document><document><id>153</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Architecture of high mobility group protein I-C.DNA complex and its perturbation upon phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>The high mobility group I-C (HMGI-C) protein is an abundant component of rapidly proliferating undifferentiated cells.

The protein has three minor groove DNA-binding domains (AT-hooks). Here, we describe the complex of HMGI-C with a fragment of the beta-interferon promoter. We show that the protein binds to NRDI and PRDII elements of the promoter with its first and second AT-hook, respectively. Phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase leads to a partial derailing of the AT-hooks from the minor groove, affecting mainly the second binding domain. In contrast, binding to long AT stretches of DNA involves contacts with all three AT-hooks and is marginally sensitive to phosphorylation. Our data stress the importance of conformation of the DNA binding site and protein phosphorylation for its function.</text></passage></document><document><id>154</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic studies of the Syrian hamster.

A total of 14 527 cases registered by the East Anglian cancer registry and diagnosed between 1989 and 1993 were included. The cases were analysed in two age groups (&lt; 75, 75+ years) and two hospital groups: group 1, those treated at hospitals with radiotherapy and oncology departments; group 2, other district general hospitals. Adjusted hazard ratios derived from Cox's proportional hazards model and adjusted conditional survival curves were presented. We found that after adjustment for age, sex and tumour stage at diagnosis, survival up to 5 years after diagnosis was usually worse in group 2 hospitals and significantly so for patients aged &lt; 75 years with breast, ovarian and rectal tumours. Hospital workload produced little significant effect independently from hospital group. Analysing the selected cancer sites using uniform definitions and consistent staging supports the view that the strategy proposed in the Calman-Hine report is likely to be beneficial, but particular priority for change should be given to younger patients with breast, ovarian and rectal tumours.</text></passage></document><document><id>156</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Germline p53 mutation in a case of Li-Fraumeni syndrome presenting gastric cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset></passage></document><document><id>157</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>APC gene mutations and colorectal adenomatosis in familial adenomatous polyposis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset><text>Correlations between germline APC mutation sites and colorectal pathophenotypes, as evaluated by the direct count of adenomas at colectomy, were investigated analysing colectomy specimens from 29 FAP patients carrying one mis-sense (codon 208) and 14 frame-shift or non-sense APC mutations (codons 232, 367, 437, 623, 876, 995, 1061, 1068, 1075, 1112, 1114, 1309, 1324, 1556). The mis-sense mutation at codon 208 was associated with a relatively mild colorectal pathophenotype. The mutation at codon 367, subject to alternative splicing, was associated with attenuated FAP. The mutation at codon 1309 was associated with the profuse colorectal adenomatosis. For 13 mutations, predicted to result in null alleles or truncated APC proteins, we correlated density and distribution of colorectal adenomas with the predicted functional effects of the mutation. The most severe colorectal pathophenotype was significantly associated with the truncating mutation at codon 1309, which is located downstream to the I beta-catenin binding domain but upstream II beta-catenin-binding domain. Mutations between codons 867 and 1114, which affect the I beta-catenin binding domain, as well as mutations occurring in exons 6 and 9, predicted to result in null alleles, were associated with a less severe colorectal pathophenotype. Overall, the highest number of adenomas was detected in the right colon, followed by the left colon, transverse colon sigma and rectum.

The present molecular studies of six Japanese WAS patients identified five different mutations of WASP, including two novel mutations (45delG, 395insGGAGAT), the latter appearing to have occurred de novo. Familial carriers were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis, restriction enzyme digestion and direct sequencing of PCR products. Neither mRNA nor the protein product were detectable in any of the patients, while various amounts of WASP protein were expressed in carriers, normal controls, haematopoietic cell lines of all lineages and in one patient after receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

The OAT4 cDNA consisted of 2210 base pairs that encoded a 550-amino acid residue protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. The amino acid sequence of OAT4 showed 38 to 44% identity to those of other members of the OAT family. Northern blot analysis revealed that OAT4 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the placenta as well as in the kidney. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, OAT4 mediated the high affinity transport of estrone sulfate (K(m) = 1.01 microM) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (K(m) = 0.63 microM) in a sodium-independent manner. OAT4 also mediated the transport of ochratoxin A. OAT4-mediated transport of estrone sulfate was inhibited by several sulfate conjugates, such as p-nitrophenyl sulfate, alpha-naphthyl sulfate, beta-estradiol sulfate, and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. By contrast, glucuronide conjugates showed little or no inhibitory effect on the OAT4-mediated transport of estrone sulfate. OAT4 interacted with chemically heterogeneous anionic compounds, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, sulfobromophthalein, penicillin G, and bile salts, whereas tetraethylammonium, an organic cation, did not. OAT4 is the first member of the multispecific organic anion transporter family, which is expressed abundantly in the placenta. OAT4 might be responsible for the elimination and detoxification of harmful anionic substances from the fetus.</text></passage></document><document><id>166</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of a human melanoma cell line with non-oestrogen receptor dependent tamoxifen resistance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>While investigating the mechanism of synergistic cytotoxicity between tamoxifen (TAM) and cisplatin (DDP) we developed a TAM-resistant variant of the human melanoma cell line T-289. We sought to characterize this cell line with respect to the effect of TAM resistance on a variety of different intracellular cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways. A TAM-resistant variant cell line (289 TAMs) was developed and the technique of Western analysis was to determine the changes in protein expression that occurred as a result of the development of TAM resistance. In this model, TAM resistance resulted in an increase in the detectable basal levels of cyclin E, GADD 153, p16, BAX, Bcl-XL, and wild-type and mutant p53, an increase in TAM induction of p16, and a decrease in the detectable basal levels of cyclin D1, p21 and p27. There were no detectable changes in the levels of pRb. In the TAM-resistant variant, p21 levels were essentially undetectable, while p27 was present and maintained its response to TAM Induction, albeit at a much lower level. This investigation demonstrates that the development of TAM resistance is associated with a change in the detectable levels of a variety of cell cycle control and apoptosis-related proteins. While the exact role that each change plays in the development of tamoxifen resistance remains to be determined, these data suggest that the development of resistance to a particular agent results in changes in multiple, seemingly unrelated pathways. These data have implications for future studies in both the laboratory and the clinic.</text></passage></document><document><id>167</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Three differentially expressed survivin cDNA variants encode proteins with distinct antiapoptotic functions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family that is believed to play a role in oncogenesis. To elucidate further its physiologic role(s), we have characterized the murine survivin gene and complementary DNA (cDNA). The structural organization of the survivin gene, located on chromosome 11E2, is similar to that of its human counterpart, both containing 4 exons. Surprisingly, 3 full-length murine survivin cDNA clones were isolated, predicting the existence of 3 distinct survivin proteins. The longest open reading frame, derived from all 4 exons, predicts a 140-amino acid residue protein, survivin(140), similar to human survivin, which contains a single IAP repeat and a COOH-terminal coiled-coil domain that links its function to the cell cycle. A second cDNA, which retains intron 3, predicts the existence of a 121-amino acid protein, survivin(121) that lacks the coiled-coil domain. Removal of exon 2-derived sequences by alternative pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing results in a third 40-amino acid residue protein, survivin(40), lacking the IAP repeat and coiled-coil structure. Predictably, only recombinant survivin(140) and survivin(121) inhibited caspase-3 activity. All 3 mRNA species were variably expressed during development from 7.5 days postcoitum. Of the adult tissues surveyed, thymus and testis accumulated high levels of survivin(140) mRNA, whereas survivin(121)-specific transcripts were detected in all tissues, while those representing survivin(40) were absent. Human counterparts to the 3 survivin mRNA transcripts were identified in a study of human cells and tissues. The presence of distinct isoforms of survivin that are expressed differentially suggests that survivin plays a complex role in regulating apoptosis.

The objectives of this study were to estimate the proportion of unselected pancreatic cancer patients belonging to hereditary cancer syndrome families and to determine the frequency ofp16, BRCA1, BRCA2, hMSH2, and hMLH1 germ-line mutations in patients with a personal or family history of cancer. The study population consisted of 102 patients with histologically verified pancreatic adenocarcinoma, unselected for age, sex, family history, or ethnic origin. Patients completed a family history questionnaire and provided blood for mutation analysis. Three-generation pedigrees were constructed and classified as high risk/familial, intermediate risk/ familial, intermediate risk/nonfamilial, or low risk according to defined criteria. High- and intermediate-risk cases were analyzed for germ-line mutations using a combination of methods. Thirty-eight of 102 (37%) patients were characterized as high or intermediate risk, and the remainder were classified as low risk. Germ-line mutations were identified in five (13%) of these cases [one in p16 (I49S); one in BRCA1 (5382 insC); and three in BRCA2 (6174delT)]. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were identified in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Four of the mutation carriers had strong family histories of the syndromes associated with the mutated genes. No mutations were identified in patients in whom the sole risk factor was a family history of pancreatic cancer, and only one mutation was found among patients with early-onset disease. We conclude that known causes of genetic predisposition are an important risk factor in a small proportion of pancreatic cancer patients, especially if associated with a strong family history of syndromes associated with the disease. The lack of detectable germ-line mutations in most high- and intermediate-risk cases suggests that there are probably additional, as yet unidentified genes predisposing to this disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>169</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA 1/2 gene mutation testing-based cancer prevention and the moral concerns of different types of patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset></passage></document><document><id>170</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Type II human complement C2 deficiency.

In order to study the genomic organization and transcriptional regulation of the AMAC-1 gene, genomic clones were isolated by screening a human lambda genomic library. Sequencing of a clone with a 1.7-kb insert gave a partial genomic sequence for the AMAC-1 gene. The complete AMAC-1 genomic sequence was obtained by bioinformational methods and the whole region spanning the AMAC-1 gene was verified by PCR amplification of subfragments and sequencing. The AMAC-1 gene consists of three exons. Whereas exons 2 and 3 were separated by a small intron of 411 bp, exon 1 and exon 2 were separated by 6 kb of non-translated genomic sequence containing two pseudoexons that are not expressed although they feature intact exon/intron boundaries and complete open reading frames. In order to allow a detailed analysis, a 2.7-kb fragment containing the promoter region and the first exon of AMAC-1 gene was cloned into a reporter gene construct. In the AMAC-1 promoter, two possible transcription start points were identified. In addition, several putative regulatory sequences for IL-4- and IFN-gamma-dependent transcriptional pathways were found including STAT6 and STAT1 binding sites as well as several AP-1 and C/EBP elements. Interestingly, a combined STAT6/STAT1 binding element is located in the direct vicinity of the first putative transcription start point. Competitive binding of IL-4-induced STAT6 versus IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 to this site may explain the antagonistic effects these cytokines exert on AMAC-1 expression.</text></passage></document><document><id>172</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Temperature-dependent sex determination in the American alligator: expression of SF1, WT1 and DAX1 during gonadogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>Sex determination in mammals and birds is chromosomal, while in many reptiles sex determination is temperature dependent. Morphological development of the gonads in these systems is conserved, suggesting that many of the genes involved in gonad development are also conserved. The genes SF1, WT1 and DAX1 play various roles in the mammalian testis-determining pathway. SF1 and WT1 are thought to interact to cause male-specific gene expression during testis development, while DAX1 is believed to inhibit this male-specific gene expression. We have cloned SF1 and DAX1 from the American alligator, a species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). SF1, DAX1 and WT1 are expressed in the urogenital system/gonad throughout the period of alligator gonadogenesis which is temperature sensitive. SF1 appears to be expressed at a higher level in females than in males. This SF1 expression pattern is concordant with the observed pattern during chicken gonadogenesis, but opposite to that observed during mouse gonadogenesis. Although the observed sexual dimorphism of gonadal SF1 expression in alligators and chickens is opposite that observed in the mouse, it is probable that SF1 is involved in control of gonadal steroidogenesis in all these vertebrates. DAX1 and WT1 are both expressed during stages 22-25 of both males and females. However, there appear to be no sex differences in the expression patterns of these genes. We conclude that DAX1, WT1 and SF1 may be involved in gonadal development of the alligator. These genes may form part of a gonadal-development pathway which has been conserved through vertebrate evolution.</text></passage></document><document><id>173</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[The Schmid-Fraccaro syndrome].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>32</offset><text>The authors describe a female patient with bilateral colobomatous malformations of the uvea in conjunction with anorectal atresia and other symptoms suggesting Schmid-Fraccaro's syndrome called also cat eye syndrome.

However, mutation analysis of the hemochromatosis-associated HFE gene has recently become available. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of no screening with four screening strategies that incorporate HFE gene testing or serum iron studies. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Siblings and children of an affected proband. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime from 10 years of age (children) or 45 years of age (siblings). PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: 1) Serum iron studies. 2) Gene testing of the proband. If the proband is homozygous (C82Y+/+), the spouse undergoes gene testing; if he or she is heterozygous (C82Y+/-), the children undergo gene testing. 3) Gene testing of the proband; if he or she is homozygous, relatives undergo gene testing. 4) Direct gene testing of relatives. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per life-year saved and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In children, HFE gene testing of the proband was the most cost-effective strategy for screening one child (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio,  508 per life-year saved). HFE gene testing of the proband followed by testing of the spouse was the most cost-effective strategy for screening two or more children (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio,  3665 per life-year saved). In siblings, all screening strategies were dominant compared with no screening. Strategies using HFE gene testing were less costly than serum iron studies. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Despite varying the prevalence of mutations and regardless of the cost of the genetic test in one- and two-way sensitivity analyses, HFE gene testing remained cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: HFE gene testing for the C282Y mutation is a cost-effective method of screening relatives of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>175</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A median nodule of the upper lip as a familial trait.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>54</offset></passage></document><document><id>176</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Suggestive evidence of a locus on chromosome 10p using the NIMH genetics initiative bipolar affective disorder pedigrees.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>As part of a four-center NIMH Genetics Initiative on Bipolar Disorder, a genome screen using 365 markers was performed on 540 DNAs from 97 families, enriched for affected relative pairs.

The aim of this study was to characterise BRCA2 germ-line mutations in Spanish male breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened DNA from 11 affected men and 6 women with breast cancer (BC) who had an affected male relative (father or brother). Exons 2-9 and 12-27 were screened by SSCP, and exons 10 and 11 were screened by PTT. PCR products with a variant band were sequenced. RESULTS: Three BRCA2 frameshift mutations were identified (17.6%): the 3374delA in codon 1049 (exon 11), 6857delAA in codon 2010 (exon 11), and 9254delATCAT in codon 3009 (exon 23). These mutations were present in patients with affected first-degree relatives (3 of 9, 33%). The proportion of male patients with a family history of BC in at least one first-degree relative was 53%. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between BRCA2 mutations and male breast cancer, especially in those with a family history of BC. The high prevalence of BRCA2 mutations among males should be considered when estimating risk for female relatives. All new male cases of BC should be regarded as being possibly inherited and should be fully investigated.</text></passage></document><document><id>178</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>ATM germline mutations in classical ataxia-telangiectasia patients in the Dutch population. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>Germline mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) .

Axin-(298-506) or Axin-(298-832), which has the GSK-3beta- and beta-catenin- but not APC-binding sites, did not enhance GSK-3beta-dependent phosphorylation of either APC-(1211-2075) or APC-(959-1338). Furthermore, beta-catenin stimulated the phosphorylation of APC-(959-1338) and APC-(1211-2075) by GSK-3beta in the presence of Axin. Consistent with these in vitro observations, expression of beta-catenin or Axin in COS cells promoted an SDS gel band shift of APC. These results indicate that APC complexed with Axin is effectively phosphorylated by GSK-3beta and that beta-catenin may modulate this phosphorylation. In addition, the heterodimeric form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) directly bound to Axin, and PP2A complexed with Axin dephosphorylated APC phosphorylated by GSK-3beta. Taken together, these results suggest that GSK-3beta-dependent phosphorylation of APC can be modulated by beta-catenin and PP2A complexed with Axin.</text></passage></document><document><id>181</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Structural analysis of PAX7 rearrangements in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>In the pediatric cancer alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the common 2;13 and less frequent 1;13 translocations fuse PAX3 and PAX7, respectively, with FKHR to produce chimeric genes.

Furthermore, we detected PAX7-FKHR genomic amplification in 10 of 11 cases, in contrast with the &lt; 5% frequency of PAX3-FKHR amplification. The differences in occurrence, reciprocity, and amplification between the PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusions indicate important differences in the mechanism of the two associated chromosomal translocation events.</text></passage></document><document><id>182</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Retino-vascular malformations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>31</offset></passage></document><document><id>183</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Eomesodermin is required for mouse trophoblast development and mesoderm formation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>The earliest cell fate decision in the mammalian embryo separates the extra-embryonic trophoblast lineage, which forms the fetal portion of the placenta, from the embryonic cell lineages. The body plan of the embryo proper is established only later at gastrulation, when the pluripotent epiblast gives rise to the germ layers ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Here we show that the T-box gene Eomesodermin performs essential functions in both trophoblast development and gastrulation. Mouse embryos lacking Eomesodermin arrest at the blastocyst stage. Mutant trophoectoderm does not differentiate into trophoblast, indicating that Eomesodermin may be required for the development of trophoblast stem cells. In the embryo proper, Eomesodermin is essential for mesoderm formation. Although the specification of the anterior-posterior axis and the initial response to mesoderm-inducing signals is intact in mutant epiblasts, the prospective mesodermal cells are not recruited into the primitive streak. Our results indicate that Eomesodermin defines a conserved molecular pathway controlling the morphogenetic movements of germ layer formation and has acquired a new function in mammals in the differentiation of trophoblast.</text></passage></document><document><id>184</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of the NF1 gene by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis reveals a high incidence of mutations in exon 4b.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>A total of 196 unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) was screened for mutations in exons 4a-c of the NF1 gene by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA fragments using intron-based primers. DNA samples with abnormal TGGE band patterns were subjected to sequence analysis. Sequence alterations were identified in ten patients (5.1%): 496delGT (1), 499delTGTT (4), T528A = D176E (2), T539A = L180X (1), 540insA (1), C574T = R192X (1). Thus, a total of six different mutations was identified in exon 4b but none in exons 4a and 4c. Only the missense mutation D176E, which we assume to be a nonpathogenic polymorphism, and the 4-base pair (bp) deletion 499delTGTT have been described before. The reason for the high incidence of mutations in exon 4b is obviously a tetranucleotide tandem repeat comprising nucleotides 495-502 (TGTTTGTT) that may give rise to slipped mispairing and subsequent deletion of one repeat unit during replication. Additionally, the recurrent 4 bp deletion was found as a second hit in a malignant schwannoma of a further NF1 patient, suggesting that microlesions may be as frequent among somatic as among germline mutations. This is the first report of a systematic study of NF1 exons 4a-c in a large group of NF1 patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>185</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The COOH-terminal transactivation domain plays a key role in regulating the in vitro and in vivo function of Pax3 homeodomain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>Efficient transcription activation by Pax3 requires binding to a complex DNA sequence element containing binding sites for both the paired domain and the Prd type homeodomain. Previously, we have shown that this requirement is lost in PAX3-FKHR, the product of a t(2;13) chromosomal translocation associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. In contrast to Pax3, the chimeric PAX3-FKHR, which acts as an oncogene, can efficiently activate a DNA sequence element containing only a homeodomain binding site (TAATAN(2-3)ATTA), despite the presence of an intact Pax3 paired domain. Here, we showed that this alteration in sequence-specific transcription activity was determined in part by the transactivation domain. First, we demonstrated that in intact Pax3, substitution of the Pax3 transactivation domain with an unrelated viral VP16 transactivation domain enabled Pax3 to transactivate homeodomain-specific DNA sequence, as well as to transform fibroblasts. Furthermore, we could abolish the homeodomain-dependent transcription and transforming activities of PAX3-FKHR by replacing its FKHR transactivation domain with Pax3 transactivation domain. Collectively, these results suggested that the transactivation domain influences the DNA binding specificity of Pax3. The translocation process increased the oncogenic potential of Pax3 by removing the inhibitory action of Pax3 transactivation domain on its homeodomain.</text></passage></document><document><id>186</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>APC mutations in sporadic colorectal tumors: A mutational "hotspot" and interdependence of the "two hits".</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Although APC mutations occur at a high frequency in colorectal cancers, few studies have performed a comprehensive analysis by screening the whole gene for mutations and assessing allelic loss. APC seems to act as a tumor-suppressor gene in a "nonclassical" fashion: data from familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) show that the site of the germ-line mutation determines the type of "second hit" in FAP tumors, and simple protein inactivation is selected weakly, if at all. In this study, we screened the entire coding region of APC for mutations and assessed allelic loss in a set of 41 colorectal cancer cell lines. Of 41 cancers, 32 (83%) showed evidence of APC mutation and/or allelic loss. We identified several APC mutations and found a "hotspot" for somatic mutation in sporadic colorectal tumors at codon 1,554. Our results suggest that APC mutations occur in the great majority of colorectal cancers, the exceptions almost all being RER+ tumors, which may substitute for altered APC function by mutations in beta-catenin and/or at other loci. When combined with previously published data, our results show that there is interdependence of the "two hits" at APC in sporadic colorectal tumors as well as in FAP. APC mutations in the "mutation cluster region," especially those close to codon 1,300, are associated with allelic loss, whereas tumors with mutations outside this region tend to harbor truncating mutations. The causes of this phenomenon are probably selection for retained N-terminal and lost C-terminal APC functions, effects on beta-catenin levels, and APC protein stability.</text></passage></document><document><id>187</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The E148Q mutation in the MEFV gene: is it a disease-causing mutation or a sequence variant?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by recurrent attacks of serositis.

While screening FMF patients for mutations in the MEFV gene, we have identified 2 individuals parents of 2 unrelated FMF patients, who were homozygous for E148Q mutation. Upon clinical examination they were absolutely disease free and therefore raised the possibility that this mutation is a benign polymorphism rather than a mutation causing disease. To further investigate the role of the E148Q in FMF we analyzed 25 parents of FMF patients and a control group of 70 individuals, Jews of Moroccan extraction to match for ethnicity of the patients. The rate of E148Q in the control group was 6.4%, being 7.8% among the patient group. Among the parents group (obligatory carriers), in addition to the 2 parents that were homozygous E148Q, in 2 families one of the parents was heterozygote for E148Q but transmitted the other allele (apparently with unknown FMF mutation) to the affected child. Two healthy sibs of one of the E148Q homozygous were also homozygous E148Q. These observations are not in accordance to the notion that E148Q is a mutation causing disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>188</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy CTG repeats in an Italian population sample: evaluation of the polymorphism for forensic applications.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>The myotonic dystrophy (DM) CTG repeat polymorphism has been studied in an Italian population sample.

METHODS: The recombinant retroviral vector pDORGM was constructed by cloning the GM-CSF cDNA into the replication defective retroviral vector pDORneo, and transferred into packaging cell line PA317 by Lipofectin method. The viral titer was determined with the NIH3T3. Using the NIH3T3 amplification assay, replication competent retroviral particles were detected. A high titer of retrovirus was used to infect the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. RESULTS: The retrovirus containing GM-CSF gene had a highest titer of virus of 1 x 10(6) colony-forming units/ml. No replication competent retrovirus were detectable in the vector preparation from the packaging cells. GM-CSF gene-modified MCF-7 cell lines stably released 500 to 800 units/10(6) cell of GM-CSF within 24h in vitro. CONCLUSION: The GM-CSF gene transferring vector mediated by retrovirus was effective and safe.

Noticeably, the first mutation in a nuclear-encoded respiratory chain component, a mutation in the 5p15 copy of the flavoprotein (Fp) subunit gene of the SDH, was reported 4 years ago in two siblings with LS and SDH deficiency. We now report a new patient with LS and SDH deficiency. Because two copies of the Fp gene are present in the human genome, we first determined the complete structure of these two copies. This allowed us to identify a 1 bp deletion creating a frameshift in the 3q29 copy, confirming that this second copy was a pseudogene. We also sequenced the promoter region of the 5p 15 gene and, in addition, screened for mutations in the patient. Sequencing of the Fp SDH cDNA in the patient only allowed us to identify a heterozygous C to T transition, changing an alanine to a valine in one allele. This transition was found to be heterozygous in the patient's father but was absent from 150 controls. Transfection of the corresponding mutant cDNA into human Fp-deficient cells failed to restore normal SDH activity, confirming the deleterious effect of this mutation. The second allele, inherited from the mother, carried an A to C substitution changing the methionine translation initiation codon to a leucine. This mutant transcript represented only 10% of total Fp transcript suggesting instability of this transcript. So far, profound deficiencies in complex II activity resulting from mutations in the Fp gene of the SDH present only as LS, a striking observation in view of the ubiquitous expression of this typical housekeeping gene in humans.</text></passage></document><document><id>191</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>TSG101 protein steady-state level is regulated posttranslationally by an evolutionarily conserved COOH-terminal sequence.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>Antisense inactivation of the tsg101 tumor susceptibility gene in murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts leads to neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis, which are reversed by restoration of tsg101 activity. tsg101 deficiency is associated with a series of mitosis-related abnormalities, whereas overexpression of TSG101 can also result in neoplastic transformation and the perturbation of cell cycling. Together, these observations imply that TSG101 production outside of a narrow range can lead to abnormal cell growth. We report here that the TSG101 protein is maintained at an almost constant steady-state level in cultured murine and human cells and that this occurs through a posttranslational process involving TSG101 protein degradation. Sustained overproduction of TSG101 from chromosomally inserted adventitious constructs resulted in compensatory down-regulation of endogenous TSG101 and replacement of the native protein by the adventitious one. Using deletion mutants of TSG101, we mapped the region responsible for autoregulation of the TSG101 steady-state level to an evolutionarily conserved sequence, here termed the "steadiness box," located near TSG101's COOH-terminal end. Our results suggest a model in which the biological effects of TSG101 are modulated either by self-promoted proteolysis or participation with other cellular protein(s) in a proteolytic feedback-control loop.</text></passage></document><document><id>192</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Somatic mutations of beta-catenin play a crucial role in the tumorigenesis of sporadic hepatoblastoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common malignant hepatic tumor during early childhood. Its molecular pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene have been identified in sporadic cases and in individuals associated with familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. beta-catenin is a key element in the cadherin-mediated cell adhesion system and Wnt/wingless pathway, and is controlled by APC. APC affects the degradation of beta-catenin by its NH(2)-terminal phosphorylation on the serine/threonine residues of exon 3. Mutations of these phosphorylation sites are primary targets for activating mutations in several types of human cancer and lead to nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin protein. In this study, we examined nine patients with HB using immunohistochemistry and direct DNA sequencing. All nine cases showed predominant nuclear expression of beta-catenin. Eight cases (89%) showed mutations involving exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene, including five with deletions and three with missense mutations. All five deletions were in-frame deletions without frameshift. The very high frequency of mutations in the beta-catenin gene suggests that beta-catenin mutations are crucial in the tumorigenesis of HB.</text></passage></document><document><id>193</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A role for complement in antibody-mediated inflammation: C5-deficient DBA/1 mice are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) represents an animal model of autoimmune polyarthritis with significant similarities to human rheumatoid arthritis that can be induced upon immunization with native type II collagen. As in rheumatoid arthritis, both cellular and humoral immune mechanisms contribute to disease pathogenesis. Genotypic studies have identified at least six genetic loci contributing to arthritis susceptibility, including the class II MHC. We have examined the mechanism of Ab-mediated inflammation in CIA joints, specifically the role of complement activation, by deriving a line of mice from the highly CIA-susceptible DBA/1LacJ strain that are congenic for deficiency of the C5 complement component. We show that such C5-deficient DBA/1LacJ animals mount normal cellular and humoral immune responses to native type II collagen, with the activation of collagen-specific TNF-alpha-producing T cells in the periphery and substantial intra-articular deposition of complement-fixing IgG Abs. Nevertheless, these C5-deficient mice are highly resistant to the induction of CIA. These data provide evidence for an important role of complement in Ab-triggered inflammation and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis.</text></passage></document><document><id>194</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic heterogeneity and penetrance analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in breast cancer families.

The first linkage and mutational studies suggested that mutations in these two genes would account for the majority of high-risk breast cancer families, but recent studies show how the proportion of families due to BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations strongly depends on the population and the types of family analyzed. It is now clear that, in the context of families with a modest cancer profile, which are the most commonly found in the clinical practice, the percentage of mutations found is much lower than that suggested by the first studies. In the present study, we analyze a group of 32 Spanish families, which contained at least three cases of female breast cancer (at least one of them diagnosed before the age of 50 years), for the presence of mutations in the BRCA genes. The total proportion of mutations was low (25%), although the percentage of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was higher, considering the breast and ovarian cancer families and the male breast cancer families respectively. Our results are in agreement with the idea that a great proportion of moderate-risk cancer families could be due to low penetrance susceptibility genes distinct from BRCA1 or BRCA2.</text></passage></document><document><id>196</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Detection of heterozygous mutations in BRCA1 using high density oligonucleotide arrays and two-colour fluorescence analysis. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>The ability to scan a large gene rapidly and accurately for all possible heterozygous mutations in large numbers of patient samples will be critical for the future of medicine .

This was markedly higher than other native complement factors studied (factor B: 35.9%, C4: 45.1%, C3: 56.2%). The concentration of C9 showed a positive correlation with gestational age and was very low, 10.8% of normal adult values in cord blood and 8.3% in the patients. Fifteen percent of the neonates had C9 levels lower than 2% of adult values. The complement activation products Bb and SC5 b-9 were significantly elevated in the patients (159% and 130% of control values, respectively), indicating alternative and terminal pathway activation. In contrast, C4 bc and C3 bc levels were not increased. The maximum amount of SC5 b-9 which could be generated in the neonatal sera by cobra venom factor was highly correlated with C9 concentration (rs = 0.86, p = 0.0001) The profound C9 deficiency found in neonates is correlated with gestational age, limits the capacity to form bacteriolytic C5 b-9 (m) and may predispose for severe invasive bacterial infection. The plasma level of SC5 b-9 under normal conditions was very low, only 0.3% (0.1%-3.0%) of the values obtained after CVF activation of the same samples.

No loci responsible for this disease or any underexcretion-type hyperuricemia/gout have ever been identified. The aim of the study was to localize a gene responsible for FJHN by linkage analysis. METHODS: A single large family with at least 20 affected members was analyzed. DNA was obtained from 13 affected and 18 non-affected members after lymphoblastoid cell lines were established. Initially, polymorphic data were obtained for 343 microsatellite loci covering all chromosomes except the X chromosome. Parametric linkage analysis was performed using the obtained data with LINKAGE package software. RESULTS: Following a genome-wide search using a set of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, initial evidence for linkage was obtained for a marker on chromosome 16p. We subsequently genotyped the same subjects for 12 additional markers spanning approximately 30 cM on the short arm of chromosome 16. We obtained a maximum 2-point logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 6.04 at theta = 0 with the marker D16S401; multipoint linkage analysis yielded a maximum LOD score of 6.14 with markers D16S401 and D16S3113, and established a minimum candidate interval of approximately 9 cM. CONCLUSION: A gene for FJHN was localized to a candidate interval of approximately 9 cM at 16p12. These findings will be useful for the presymptomatic diagnosis of FJHN in some families and for testing genetic heterogeneity of FJHN in general.</text></passage></document><document><id>199</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Substrate-dependent effect of acetonitrile on human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>Acetonitrile is an organic solvent commonly used to increase the solubility of lipophilic substrates for in vitro studies.

In both cases, the effect of acetonitrile on activity was found to be substrate-dependent. Namely, it increased diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase and tolbutamide methyl hydroxylase activities, but decreased celecoxib methyl hydroxylase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. By comparison, hydroxylation of phenytoin was resistant to its effect. The presence of acetonitrile (3%, v/v) gave rise to a lower K(m) and a higher V(max) for diclofenac hydroxylase in both liver microsomes and recombinant CYP2C9 preparations (87 and 52% increase in V(max)/K(m) ratio, respectively). On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of the solvent (1%, v/v) toward celecoxib hydroxylase was characterized by a decrease in V(max) (human liver microsomes) or a change in both K(m) and V(max) (rCYP2C9), leading to 25 and 46% decrease in V(max)/K(m) for both systems.

Similar to other tumor suppressor genes, both APC alleles are inactivated by mutation in colon tumors, resulting in the loss of full-length protein in tumor cells. The functional significance of altering APC is the dysregulation of several physiologic processes that govern colonic epithelial cell homeostasis, which include cell cycle progression, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. Roles for APC in some of these processes are in large part attributable to its ability to regulate cytosolic levels of the signaling molecule beta-catenin and to affect the transcriptional profile in cells. This article summarizes numerous genetic, biochemical, and cell biologic studies on the mechanisms of APC-mediated tumor suppression. Mouse models of FAP, in which the APC gene has been genetically inactivated, have been particularly useful in testing therapeutic and chemopreventive strategies. These data have significant implications for colorectal cancer treatment approaches as well as for understanding other disease genes and cancers of other tissue types.</text></passage></document><document><id>204</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Germline BRCA2 mutation in a patient with fallopian tube carcinoma: a case report.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: Fallopian tube carcinoma is similar to ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma with respect to histology, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis. BRCA germline mutations have been commonly reported in ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma but rarely in other gynecologic cancers. METHODS: A patient with fallopian tube carcinoma and a family history of ovarian carcinoma underwent genetic counseling and BRCA testing as did her daughter. RESULTS: The patient and her daughter were found to have a germline BRCA2 mutation. CONCLUSION: Like a family history of ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma, the occurrence of fallopian tube cancer should alert the clinician to the possibility of an abnormality in the breast cancer susceptibility 1 or 2 genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>205</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy protein, emerin, is a nuclear membrane protein. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset><text>A large fragment of emerin cDNA was prepared by PCR and expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli .

So far, maternal UPD 7 has been described in 28 cases. Here, we report 4 new cases, present clinical information of 5 cases previously reported by us, and review the clinical and molecular findings of all 32 cases. We found a phenotype characterized by pre- and postnatal growth retardation, occipitofrontal head circumference in the lower normal range, a triangular face, and retarded bone maturation. Findings of the facial gestalt included a high and broad forehead and a pointed chin. A broad mouth with down-turned corners, prominent ears, caf  -au-lait spots, hemihypotrophy, or clinodactyly were rarely present. Psychomotor development was delayed in 6 cases. The clinical findings strikingly resemble the phenotype of the heterogeneous Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). Other anomalies were less frequently found than in SRS. Molecular investigations revealed 11 cases with isodisomy and 17 cases with heterodisomy. In 4 cases this information was not available. From the allelic distribution of the microsatellites investigated, 9 cases might be the consequence of an error at maternal meiosis I, and 6 cases might be due to non-disjunction at maternal meiosis II. Three of the 17 heterodisomic cases had trisomy 7 in chorionic villi, in the remaining cases no prenatal diagnosis through chorionic villus sampling was reported. CONCLUSION: Maternal UPD 7 should investigated in children with pre- and postnatal growth retardation anda facial gestalt characterized by a high and broad forehead and a pointed chin, as well as in cofined placental mosaicism for trisomy 7.</text></passage></document><document><id>207</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The Kell blood group system: Kell and XK membrane proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>Two membrane proteins express the antigens that comprise the Kell blood group system. A single antigen, Kx, is carried on XK, a 440-amino acid protein that spans the membrane 10 times, and more than 20 antigens reside on Kell, a 93-kd, type II glycoprotein. XK and Kell are linked, close to the membrane surface, by a single disulfide bond between Kell cysteine 72 and XK cysteine 347. Although primarily expressed in erythroid tissues, Kell and XK are also present in many other tissues. The polymorphic forms of Kell are due to single base mutations that encode different amino acids. Some Kell antigens are highly immunogenic and may cause strong reactions if mismatched blood is transfused and severe fetal anemia in sensitized mothers. Antibodies to KEL1 may suppress erythropoiesis at the progenitor level, leading to fetal anemia. The cellular functions of Kell/XK are complex. Absence of XK, the McLeod phenotype, is associated with acanthocytic red blood cells (RBCs), and with late-onset forms of muscular dystrophy and nerve abnormalities. Kell, by homology, is a member of the neprilysin (M13) family of membrane zinc endopeptidases and it preferentially activates endothelin-3 by specific cleavage of the Trp21-Ile22 bond of big endothelin-3.</text></passage></document><document><id>208</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Exon deletions and duplications in BRCA1 detected by semiquantitative PCR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>rearrangements have recently been identified in the BRCA1 gene.

Although >100 mutations in the gene for human glucocerebrosidase have been described, most genotype-phenotype studies have focused upon screening for a few common mutations. In this study, we used several approaches-including direct sequencing, Southern blotting, long-template PCR, restriction digestions, and the amplification refraction mutation system (ARMS)-to genotype 128 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (64 of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and 64 of non-Jewish extraction) and 24 patients with type 3 Gaucher disease. More than 97% of the mutant alleles were identified. Fourteen novel mutations (A90T, N117D, T134I, Y135X, R170C, W184R, A190T, Y304X, A341T, D399Y, c.153-154insTACAGC, c.203-204insC, c.222-224delTAC, and c.1122-1123insTG) and many rare mutations were detected. Recombinant alleles were found in 19% of the patients. Although 93% of the mutant alleles in our Ashkenazi Jewish type 1 patients were N370S, c.84-85insG, IVS2+1G-->A or L444P, these four mutations accounted for only 49% of mutant alleles in the non-Jewish type 1 patients. Genotype-phenotype correlations were attempted. Homozygosity or heterozygosity for N370S resulted in type 1 Gaucher disease, whereas homozygosity for L444P was associated with type 3. Genotype L444P/recombinant allele resulted in type 2 Gaucher disease, and homozygosity for a recombinant allele was associated with perinatal lethal disease. The phenotypic consequences of other mutations, particularly R463C, were more inconsistent. Our results demonstrate a high rate of mutation detection, a large number of novel and rare mutations, and an accurate assessment of the prevalence of recombinant alleles. Although some genotype-phenotype correlations do exist, other genetic and environmental factors must also contribute to the phenotypes encountered, and we caution against relying solely upon genotype for prognostic or therapeutic judgements.</text></passage></document><document><id>210</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Targeted disruption of the cell-cycle checkpoint gene ATR leads to early embryonic lethality in mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>102</offset><text>Checkpoints of DNA integrity are conserved throughout evolution, as are the kinases ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related), which are related to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase [1] [2] [3]. The ATM gene is not essential, but mutations lead to ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a pleiotropic disorder characterised by radiation sensitivity and cellular checkpoint defects in response to ionising radiation [4] [5] [6]. The ATR gene has not been associated with human syndromes and, structurally, is more closely related to the canonical yeast checkpoint genes rad3(Sp) and MEC1(Sc) [7] [8]. ATR has been implicated in the response to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and blocks to DNA synthesis [8] [9] [10] [11], and may phosphorylate p53 [12] [13], suggesting that ATM and ATR may have similar and, perhaps, complementary roles in cell-cycle control after DNA damage. Here, we report that targeted inactivation of ATR in mice by disruption of the kinase domain leads to early embryonic lethality before embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5). Heterozygous mice were fertile and had no aberrant phenotype, despite a lower ATR mRNA level. No increase was observed in the sensitivity of ATR(+/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells to a variety of DNA-damaging agents. Attempts to target the remaining wild-type ATR allele in heterozygous ATR(+/-) ES cells failed, supporting the idea that loss of both alleles of the ATR gene, even at the ES-cell level, is lethal. Thus, in contrast to the closely related checkpoint gene ATM, ATR has an essential function in early mammalian development.</text></passage></document><document><id>211</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular and phenotypic characteristics of metachromatic leukodystrophy patients from Poland.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>95</offset><text>The occurrence and genotype-phenotype correlations of the eight most common mutations in the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene were studied in 43 unrelated Polish patients suffering from different types of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).

In the whole investigated group of patients, mutations c.459+1G>A and p.P426L were the most frequent, 19 and 17%, respectively. The prevalence of the third most frequent mutation, i.e. p.I179S (13%), seems to be higher than that in other populations. The incidence of c.1204+1G>A was 5%, which is higher than reported earlier (2%). It seems that p.I179S and c.1204+1G>A are more prevalent in MLD patients from Poland than from other countries. In the group examined by us, mutations p.R84Q, p.S96F, p.A212V, and c.1401-1411del were not detected; thus, 46.5% of MLD alleles remained unidentified. This indicates that other, novel or already described, but rare, mutations exist in Polish population. In late infantile homozygotes for c.459+1G>A and one homozygote for c.1204+1G>A, first clinical symptom was motor deterioration. In adult homozygotes for p.P426L, the disease onset manifested as gait disturbances, followed by choreoathetotic movements, difficulties in swallowing, dysarthria, tremor, and nystagmus. In the carriers of the p.I179S mutation, the hallmark of the clinical picture was psychotic disturbances.</text></passage></document><document><id>212</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Retinoblastoma susceptibility protein, Rb, possesses multiple BRCT-Ws, BRCA1 carboxyl-terminus-related W regions with DNA break-binding activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>146</offset><text>The BRCT region, the carboxyl-terminus of BRCA1 (the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 product), is ubiquitous in several proteins that participate in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair.

Although a variety of naturally occurring mutations have been identified in patient alleles, few have been well characterized. We have explored the functional significance of a common patient mutation, F171S, using a strategy of conservative substitution at the defined residue followed by expression of the wild-type and, alternatively, substituted proteins in a null-background strain of yeast. As expected from patient studies, the F171S-hGALT protein demonstrated &lt;0.1% wild-type levels of activity, although two of three conservatively substituted moieties, F171L- and F171Y-hGALT, demonstrated approximately 10% and approximately 4% activity, respectively. The third protein, F171W, demonstrated severely reduced abundance, precluding further study. Detailed kinetic analyses of purified wild-type, F171L- and F171Y-hGALT enzymes, coupled with homology modeling of these proteins, enabled us to suggest that the effects of these substitutions resulted largely from altering the position of a catalytically important residue, Gln-188, and secondarily, by altering the subunit interface and perturbing hexose binding to the uridylylated enzyme. These results not only provide insight into the functional impact of a single common patient allele and offer a paradigm for similar studies of other clinically or biochemically important residues, but they further help to elucidate activity of the wild-type human GALT enzyme.</text></passage></document><document><id>214</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Spectrum of Delta(7)-dehydrocholesterol reductase mutations in patients with the Smith-Lemli-Opitz (RSH) syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS; also known as the RSH syndrome) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, leading to characteristic multi-organ developmental abnormalities, dysmorphic facies, limb malformations and mental retardation. Mutations in the gene for Delta(7)-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Delta(7)-reductase), which catalyzes the last step in cholesterol biosynthesis, cause the disease. We screened 32 patients with SLOS, 28 from the USA and four from Sweden. Twenty-two different nucleotide changes, predicted to be disease-causing mutations, were identified; 20 missense mutations, one nonsense mutation and one splice-site mutation involving the exon 9 acceptor site (IVS8 -1G-->C) were detected. All probands were heterozygous for mutations. Twelve of these mutations have not been reported previously, including missense mutations L148R, F168I, D175H, P179L, P243R, F284L, N287K, F302L, R404S, Y462H, R469P and one nonsense mutation W37X [corrected]. Coupled with previously reported mutations, these findings bring the total of different Delta(7)-reductase mutations to 36. These are distributed throughout the coding sequence of the Delta(7)-reductase gene except exons 3 and 5, with a clustering in exon 9. Three mutations account for 54% of those observed in our cohort, the splice acceptor site mutation IVS8 -1G-->C (22/64 alleles, 34%), T93M (8/64, 12.5%) and V326L (5/64, 7.8%). Severity of SLOS was negatively correlated with both plasma cholesterol and relative plasma cholesterol, but not with 7-dehydrocholesterol, the immediate precursor, confirming previous observations. However, no correlation was observed between mutations and phenotype, suggesting that the degree of severity may be affected by other factors. We estimate that between 33 and 42% of the variation in the SLOS severity score is accounted for by variation in plasma cholesterol. Thus, factors other than plasma cholesterol are additionally involved in determining severity.</text></passage></document><document><id>215</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 susceptibility markers and postmenopausal breast cancer: the Iowa Women's Health Study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Much research on early-onset breast cancer families has been performed and has shown that breast cancer in many of these families is linked to either BRCA1 or BRCA2. Fewer studies have examined the role of genetic predisposition in postmenopausal breast cancer. A nested case-control family study of breast cancer was conducted within the Iowa Women's Health Study, a population-based prospective study of 41,836 postmenopausal women. Probands were 251 incident cases diagnosed between 1988 and 1989. Three-generation pedigrees were developed through mailed questionnaires. From this collection of pedigrees, thirteen were identified for more detailed genetic analysis. Sibling-pair linkage analyses were performed using polymorphic markers in candidate regions in these 13 families with multiple cases of breast and other cancers. Four of the DNA markers are located on chromosome 17, and two of these (D17S579 and THRA1) flank the BRCA1 locus. Significant evidence for linkage to D17S579 was obtained in the total sample, in a model without inclusion of covariates or age at onset (P = 0.005), and in a model adjusted for five measured covariates and for variable age at onset (P = 0.008). Complete sequencing of the BRCA1 gene in these families, including all intron/exon boundaries, failed to reveal any mutations in 24 women with breast cancer from the 13 families. These data suggest that in some families identified by postmenopausal breast cancer cases, breast cancer risk may be mediated by a gene (or genes) in the BRCA1 region, but not BRCA1 itself.</text></passage></document><document><id>216</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The extent of linkage disequilibrium caused by selection on G6PD in humans.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>The gene coding for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is subject to positive selection by malaria in some human populations.

To delimit the impact of selection on patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and nucleotide diversity, we resequenced 5.1 kb at G6PD and approximately 2-3 kb at each of eight loci in a 2.5-Mb region roughly centered on G6PD in a diverse sub-Saharan African panel of 51 unrelated men (including 20 G6PD A-, 11 G6PD A+, and 20 G6PD B chromosomes). The signature of selection is evident in the absence of genetic variation at G6PD and at three neighboring loci within 0.9 Mb from G6PD among all individuals bearing G6PD A- alleles. A genomic region of approximately 1.6 Mb around G6PD was characterized by long-range LD associated with the A- alleles. These patterns of nucleotide variability and LD suggest that G6PD A- is younger than previous age estimates and has increased in frequency in sub-Saharan Africa due to strong selection (0.1 &lt; s &lt; 0.2). These results also show that selection can lead to nonrandom associations among SNPs over great physical and genetic distances, even in African populations.</text></passage></document><document><id>217</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The expression profile for the tumour suppressor gene PTEN and associated polymorphic markers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>95</offset><text>PTEN, a putative tumour suppressor gene associated with prostate and other cancers, is known to be located within the chromosomal region 10q23.3. Transcription of the PTEN gives rise to multiple mRNA species. Analyses by Northern blots, using cell lines which express PTEN together with cell lines which have lost the PTEN or carry a truncated version of the gene, has allowed us to demonstrate that the pseudogene is not transcribed. In addition, 3' RACE studies confirmed that the multiple mRNA species arising from the gene probably result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. No evidence for tissue- or cell-specific patterns of transcription was found. Analysis by 5' RACE placed the putative site for the start of transcription around 830 bp upstream of the start codon. A map of the location of the PTEN gene with a series of overlapping YAC, BAC and PACs has been constructed and the relative position of eight microsatellite markers sited. Two known and one novel marker have been positioned within the gene, the others are in flanking regions. The more accurate location of these markers should help in future studies of the extent of gene loss. Several polymorphisms were also identified, all were within introns. Four of the common polymorphisms appear to be linked. In blood, DNA from 200 individuals, including normal, BPH and prostate cancer patients, confirmed this link. Only two samples of 200 did not carry the linked haplotype, both were patients with advanced prostate cancer.

The FMF gene (MEFV) was cloned and missense mutations were found to be responsible for the disease. We investigated a large series of 303 unselected and unrelated patients of various ethnic backgrounds with a clinical suspicion of FMF to confirm or invalidate the diagnosis of FMF and to determine the spectrum of MEFV mutations. Molecular analysis focused on all the most frequent mutations identified so far, and an exhaustive analysis of exon 10, containing the mutational hotspot, was performed through DNA sequencing. Sixty-two percent of Sephardic, North African Arabs, Armenian and Turkish patients were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for MEFV mutations. In other populations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea such as Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Kurdish and Lebanese populations, mutations were also found. In general, patients without Mediterranean origin had no mutations in the MEFV gene.

The index of paternity calculated for other serological (seven erythrocyte antigens, six serum protein systems, and seven isozymes, as well as the A- and B-HLA loci) and nine DNA markers, excluding ACP and Apo B, gives a very high (virtually certain) degree of paternity for the presumptive father. Maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 2 was suspected. Evaluation of polymorphic DNA markers (STRs) spanning chromosome 2 of the child, mother, and presumptive father demonstrated that the girl had inherited two maternal chromosome 2 homologues, whereas alleles for markers from other chromosomes were inherited from the father in a Mendelian fashion. The girl was homoallelic for informative markers mapping to the chromosomal regions 2p23-25, but she was heteroallelic for informative markers on the long arm of chromosome 2, establishing that the maternal UPD with partial isodisomy of the short arm was caused by a meiosis I nondisjunction event with genetic recombination (chiasmata in this region 2p23-25) during oogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>220</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Twenty-four novel mutations in Wilson disease patients of predominantly European ancestry.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>Wilson disease (WND), an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport, shows wide genotypic and phenotypic variability, with hepatic and/or neurological symptoms.

ATP7B mutations result in copper storage in liver and brain. From 247 WND patients worldwide whose DNA has been sequenced in our laboratory, we have identified 24 new mutations. The origins of the patients were European white (one deletion, one nonsense, one splice site, and 18 missense), Chinese (one deletion, one missense) and Bangladeshi (one missense). Most of these had strong support as disease causing mutations, based on conservation between species, structural changes, and absence in controls. One missense mutation in a Chinese patient was considered uncertain because of its conservative nature and position in the protein. We also identified 15 nucleotide substitutions (11 of them new) causing silent or intronic changes, none of which produce an additional splice site that could lead to disease. Characterization of mutations, both disease-causing and normal variants, is essential for accurate molecular diagnosis of this condition.</text></passage></document><document><id>221</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>C3 metabolism in a patient with deficiency of the second component of complement (C2) and discoid lupus erythematosus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>A patient with a hereditary deficiency of the second component of complement and discoid lupus erythematosus with features of systemic lupus erythematosus was studied.

Examination of his serum disclosed antinuclear antibodies but no total haemolytic complement activity. C2 was absent. Serum concentrations of C1s, C3, C5 and C9 were elevated; other complement components were present in normal concentration, including C3 pro-activator. The patient's C3 pro-activator was electrophoretically converted by inulin and four of five lipopolysaccharides, but was poorly converted by aggregated human IgG. Two separate turnover studies with radiolabelled C3 showed fractional catabolic rates of 3-03 and 2-48% of the remaining plasma pool/hr (range of three normals: 1-62-2-18%/hr); and estimated C3 synthetic rates of 2-74 and 2-31 mg/kg/hr (range of three normals: 0-89-1-40 mg/kg/hr). Serum complement profiles of the patient's family demonstrated that the C2 deficiency was inherited as an autosomal codominant. One sibling, homozygous for C2 deficiency, and three other siblings, both parents and one daughter, all heterozygous for C2 deficiency, are in good health. Immunofluorescent studies of the patient's diseased skin exhibited substantial deposits of IgG, IgM, C1q, and C4 but not of later acting complement components, properdin, or C3 proactivator.

Although an 'at-risk' individual may receive a gene-positive result, neurological examination remains the most accessible, reliable and cost effective means of determining clinical disease onset.</text></passage></document><document><id>223</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Somatosensory evoked potentials after multisegmental lower limb stimulation in focal lesions of the lumbosacral spinal cord.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: Recording techniques permit the separate analysis of the response from cauda equina roots and the spinal potential that is probably generated by the activation of dorsal horn cells. To improve the functional assessment of focal lesions of the lumbosacral cord, lower limb somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were measured by multisegmental stimulation. METHODS: Common peroneal and tibial nerves SEPs were recorded in 14 patients in whom MRI demonstrated compressive cord damage ranging from T9 to L1 levels. SEPs were recorded in each patient at the lumbar level (cauda equina response), lower thoracic level (spinal response), and from the scalp (cortical response). RESULTS: Abnormalities in spinal response occurred in 50% and 70% of tibial and common peroneal nerve SEPs respectively; these findings were well explained by the radiological compression level, involving in most of the patients lumbar rather than sacral myelomeres. The SEPs were often more effective than the clinical examination in showing the actual extension of damage. CONCLUSIONS: The recording of spinal SEPs after multisegmental lower limb stimulation proved useful in assessing cord dysfunction and determining the cord levels mainly involved by the compression.</text></passage></document><document><id>224</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Transcriptional modulation of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL by the paired box transcription factors PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>The aberrant expression of the transcription factors PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR associated with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), solid tumors displaying muscle cell features, suggests that these proteins play an important role in the pathogenesis of RMS. We could previously demonstrate that one of the oncogenic functions of PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR in RMS is protection from apoptosis. BCL-XL is a prominent anti-apoptotic protein present in normal skeletal muscle and RMS cells. In the present study, we establish that BCL-XL is transcriptionally modulated by PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR, since enhanced expression of both PAX proteins stimulates transcription of endogenous BCL-XL mRNA in a cell type specific manner. Further, we present evidence that both PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR can transcriptionally activate the Bcl-x gene promoter in cotransfection assays. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, an ATTA binding site for PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR could be localized in the upstream promoter region (position -42 to -39). Finally, ectopic overexpression of either PAX3, PAX3/FKHR or BCL-XL can rescue tumor cells from apoptosis induced by antisense treatment. These results suggest that at least part of the anti-apoptotic effect of PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR is mediated through direct transcriptional modulation of the prominent anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL.

Transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, can be induced by cell-cell contact. In the current work, we sought to determine if this induction is dependent on transformation of cells to a malignant phenotype and subsequently to determine which signaling molecules mediate activation of VEGF transcription. METHODS: Normal and transformed prostate epithelial cell lines were examined at various cell densities to simulate the effect of increased cell contact on expression of VEGF messenger RNA. Transformed cells were also cotransfected with a VEGF promoter-reporter construct and with constructs that express dominant negative or activated versions of signal transduction proteins hypothesized to be involved in the cell-cell contact process, and reporter activity was assessed at various cell densities. All P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Direct cell-cell contact, but not extracellular matrix components, resulted in transcriptional activation of a VEGF promoter-reporter construct in malignant (P&lt;.0001) but not in nonmalignant (P =.37) prostate cells. This process was mediated via a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); it required the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rap1, and Raf and was Ras independent. In addition, transcriptional activation of a Ras-sensitive Elk-1 chimeric reporter by cell-cell contact suggests that Rap1 is a key factor in regulating the specificity of convergent MAPK-signaling pathways arising from different upstream extracellular stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: Cell contact induction of VEGF transcription via FAK and Rap1 provides a novel Ras-independent, but transformation-dependent, mechanism for stimulus-specific regulation of tumor VEGF expression via MAPK.</text></passage></document><document><id>226</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characteristics of BRCA1 mutations in a population-based case series of breast and ovarian cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>Breast and ovarian cancers account for approximately 210000 newly diagnosed cases per year. More than half a million American women are estimated to be carriers of a breast cancer susceptibility gene. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of characteristics such as, age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity and family history of cancer with inherited BRCA1 mutations in a population-based sample of breast and ovarian cancer cases. No selection was made by race, age at diagnosis or positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The population under study was all breast cancer cases diagnosed in Orange County, CA, during the 1-year period beginning 1 March 1994 and all ovarian cancer cases diagnosed in Orange County during the 2-year period beginning 1 March 1994. This report focuses on the first consecutively ascertained 802 participating probands enrolled in the study, of which 9 were male breast cancer probands, 673 were female breast cancer probands and 120 were ovarian cancer probands. We observed 11 BRCA1 mutations or 1.6% (95% CI: 0.8-2.9) among the 673 female breast cancer probands and 4 BRCA1 mutations or 3.3% (95% CI: 0.8-8. 3) among the 120 ovarian cancer probands. No BRCA1 mutations were identified among the 98 non-white breast and ovarian cancer probands. The prevalence of BRCA1 mutations in non-Hispanic-white breast cancer cases below the age of 50 years was 2%. Positive family history of breast or ovarian cancers was significantly associated with BRCA1 mutation status among breast cancer probands. Similarly, positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer was significantly associated with BRCA1 mutation status among the ovarian cancer probands. In summary, we present results on the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations in a significantly larger sample of population-based breast and ovarian cancer cases than previously reported. The results indicate that, using a conservative approach to targeted genotyping of BRCA1, the frequency of mutations was consistent with those reported using similar methods of population-based case ascertainment.</text></passage></document><document><id>227</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The new voltage gated potassium channel KCNQ5 and neonatal convulsions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>In 1998, mutations in the voltage gated potassium channel gene KCNQ2 were found to be the main cause underlying the autosomal dominant inherited syndrome of benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC).

As a combination of mutations in the RDS/Peripherin and the ROM1 genes leads to the phenotype of retinitis pigmentosa in man we first performed mutation analysis to screen these genes for disease causing mutations followed by the investigation of a digenic inheritance in dogs. We cloned the RDS/Peripherin gene and investigated the RDS/Peripherin and ROM1 genes for disease causing mutations in 13 gPRA-affected dog breeds including healthy animals, obligate gPRA carriers and gPRA-affected dogs. We screened for mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Sequence analysis revealed several sequence variations. In the coding region of the RDS/Peripherin gene three nucleotide exchanges were identified (A277C; C316T; G1255A), one of which leads to an amino acid substitution (Ala339Thr). Various silent sequence variations were found in the coding region of the ROM1 gene (A536G, G1006A, T1018C, T1111C, C1150T, C1195T), as well as an amino acid substitution (G252T; Ala54Ser). By excluding the respective gene as a cause for gPRA several sequence variations in the intronic regions were investigated. None of these sequence variations cosegregated with autosomal recessively (ar) transmitted gPRA in 11 breeds. The candidate gene RDS/Peripherin obviously does not harbour the critical mutation causing the autosomal recessive form of gPRA because diseased individuals show heterozygous genotypes for sequence variations in the Miniature Poodle, Dachshund, Australian Cattle Dog, Cocker Spaniel, Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Entlebucher Sennenhund, Sloughi, Yorkshire Terrier, Tibet Mastiff, Tibet Terrier and Labrador Retriever breeds. In the following breeds the ROM1 gene was also excluded indirectly for gPRA: Miniature Poodle, Dachshund, Australian Cattle Dog, Sloughi, Collie, Tibet Terrier, Labrador Retriever and Saarloos/Wolfhound. Digenic inheritance for gPRA is practically excluded for both these genes in four breeds: Miniature Poodle, Dachshund, Labrador Retriever and Saarloos/Wolfhound.</text></passage></document><document><id>230</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular analysis of the HEXA gene in Italian patients with infantile and late onset Tay-Sachs disease: detection of fourteen novel alleles.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>142</offset><text>Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a recessively inherited disorder caused by the hexosaminidase A deficiency.

Phenotypic expression is variable making clinical diagnosis difficult, while diagnosis by Southern blotting is relatively expensive and labour intensive. The prevalence in Singapore has not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a rapid screening test using a PCR analysis. We studied 255 males with unexplained cause for learning difficulties from 8 special schools. A clinical scoring system based on characteristic features described was devised. RESULTS: PCR analysis showed absence of the band for the normal allele in 11 samples, 6 of which were confirmed by Southern blotting to be positive for FMR1 expansion, giving a 2% false-positive rate with PCR. Sensitivity of the PCR test was evaluated by performing Southern blotting in all PCR-normal samples; all of which were confirmed to be normal. This PCR test was shown to be highly reproducible. Clinical criteria were not predictive. CONCLUSIONS: Six (2.4%) new cases of fragile X syndrome were detected. There is a need to incorporate fragile X testing in routine screening of patients with developmental delay and learning difficulties. The use of PCR could eliminate the need for Southern blotting in up to 95% of cases. PCR analysis provides a simple, reliable and rapid tool for screening.</text></passage></document><document><id>232</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evaluation of the accuracy of enzymatically determined carrier status for Krabbe disease by DNA-based testing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>111</offset></passage></document><document><id>233</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fragile X CGG repeat structures among African-Americans: identification of a novel factor responsible for repeat instability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>The cryptic CGG repeat responsible for the fragile X syndrome, located in the 5'-UTR of FMR1, is unique compared with the many other triplet repeat-causing diseases, making it ideal for identifying factors involved in repeat expansion that may be common to other triplet repeat diseases. To date, a number of factors have been identified which may influence repeat instability, including the number and position of interspersed AGGs, length of the 3' pure CGG repeat and haplotype background. However, nearly all such data were derived from studies of Caucasians. Using a large African-American population, we present the only comprehensive examination of factors associated with CGG repeat instability in a non-Caucasian population. Among Caucasians, susceptible alleles were thought to come from those in the intermediate repeat range (41-60 repeats); however, we find that susceptible alleles may come from a larger repeat pool (35-60 repeats) and are better defined by their pure CGG repeat and/or -presence of only one AGG interruption. These results demonstrate the existence of different susceptible alleles among world populations and may account for the similar prevalence of the fragile X syndrome in African-Americans compared with Caucasians despite the lower frequency of inter-mediate sized alleles in the African-American population. Finally, we show that repeat structures among unaffected African-Americans with the most frequent fragile X haplotype background are either pure or contain a single distal interruption. We propose that the lack of a proximal most interruption is a novel factor involved in CGG repeat instability.</text></passage></document><document><id>234</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Early-latency somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by electrical acupuncture after needling acupoint LI-4.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>111</offset><text>The stimulating methods of prior studies on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) elicited by acupoint stimulus had involved surface electrodes, while the clinical practice of acupuncture is mostly performed by inserting the acupuncture needle inside the body. Clinical observations show that there are often some special sensations when LI-4 is needled. To observe if the SEPs produced by acupoint acupuncture had a distinguishing property, we studied the SEPs elicited by electrical acupuncture after the acupuncture needle was inserted into LI-4 and its control point, and then mapped them with the 128-channel Electric Brain Signal Image system. We also compared this to SEPs by median nerve stimuli. Results showed that the most interesting finding was the marked differences of N1-P1 and N2-P2 amplitude between SEPs at LI-4 (SEP-LI) and its control point (SEP-CP), which were in the opposite direction. Marked differences were also found between latencies and amplitudes of the SEPs elicited by acupuncture and by median nerve stimulus (SEP-M). The differences between SEP-LI and SEP-CP might be due to the additional effects of the activation of nerve endings and muscle spindles in LI-4 to the SEPs formed by the activation of superficial and deep radial nerves during electrical acupuncture. The differences between SEPs to acupoint and median nerve stimuli might be mainly due to the different distances from the stimulated regions to the cerebral cortex, the diversity and the number of activated fibers.</text></passage></document><document><id>235</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis and quantitation of mRNAs encoding the alpha- and beta-subunits of rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase in neonatal retinal degeneration (rd) mouse retinas.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>170</offset><text>The retinal degeneration(rd) mouse is a commonly-studied animal model of the family of human-inherited retinal blindness known as retinitis pigmentosa, and is a likely model in which therapies for these conditions will continue to be developed and tested.

BACKGROUND: PROMM is a recently described autosomal dominantly inherited disorder similar to but distinct from myotonic dystrophy (DM). DM belongs to the group of inherited disorders with anticipation caused by an unstable trinucleotide repeat expansion. In PROMM, no mutation has been identified, although PROMM has recently been mapped to a gene locus on chromosome 3q. METHODS: We investigated 10 German families with the PROMM phenotype and linkage to chromosome 3q. We based our analysis of anticipation on the age of disease onset. Anticipation was assumed if the offspring had first symptoms earlier in life than his or her affected parent. For statistical analysis Independence Estimating Equations (IEE) and a Monte-Carlo bootstrap were used. RESULTS: In 27 affected living parent-offspring pairs from these 10 families, the mean difference of disease onset was 18.8 years with either statistical analysis (p &lt; 10-14 and p &lt; 10-15). The mean disease onset interval in years was greater in father-offspring as compared to the mother-offspring pairs (p &lt; 0.05; IEE). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the occurrence of anticipation in parent-offspring pairs from families with the PROMM phenotype and linkage to chromosome 3q. The different disease onset intervals in mother-offspring and father-offspring pairs could indicate a mild parent-of-origin effect. These observations are compatible with the suggestion that PROMM, like DM, may be a trinucleotide repeat associated disorder. In contrast to DM, anticipation in PROMM is milder, a congenital form does not seem to occur, and fertility does not appear to be affected.</text></passage></document><document><id>237</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular analysis of the APC gene in 205 families: extended genotype-phenotype correlations in FAP and evidence for the role of APC amino acid changes in colorectal cancer predisposition. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>189</offset><text>BACKGROUND / AIMS  The development of colorectal cancer and a variable range of extracolonic manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is the result of the dominant inheritance of adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene mutations .

The protein C (PROC) genes of nine unrelated individuals with severe protein C deficiency were sequenced yielding a total of 13 different lesions. Eight of these were novel, including a gross gene deletion, three missense mutations, two micro-deletions, a splicing mutation and a single base-pair substitution in the HNF-3 binding site in the PROC gene promoter. Evidence for the pathogenicity of the mutations detected was obtained by molecular modelling, in vitro splicing assay and reporter gene assay. Neither the plasma protein C activity level nor the nature of the PROC gene lesions detected were found to be a good prognostic indicator of the age of onset or clinical severity of thrombotic symptoms. Other factors may thus complicate the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype. Indeed, in two patients, the inheritance of either one or two Factor V Leiden alleles in addition to two PROC gene lesions could have served to precipitate the thrombotic events. No association was however apparent between clinical severity and the possession of a particular promoter polymorphism genotype.

Analysis of WND variant ATP7B proteins revealed that several were able to completely, or nearly completely, complement a mutant yeast strain in which the ATP7B ortholog CCC2 was disrupted, indicating that these ATP7B proteins retained copper transport activity. We analyzed the intracellular localization of these active WND ATP7B variant proteins using transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells and triple-label immunofluorescence microscopy, as a second possible aspect of defective function. Two ATP7B variants, Asp765Asn and Leu776Val, which have normal copper transport activity in yeast, retained partial normal Golgi network localization, but were predominantly mislocalized throughout the cell. Asp765Asn and Leu776Val proteins were capable of only partial copper-dependent redistribution. WND variant protein Arg778Leu, which has defective function in yeast, was extensively mislocalized, presumably to the endoplasmic reticulum. ATP7B variant proteins Gly943Ser, which has nearly normal function in yeast, and CysProCys/Ser (mutation of the conserved CysProCys motif to SerProSer), inactive in yeast, were localized normally but were unable to redistribute in response to copper. Localization data from this study, combined with functional data from our yeast studies, provide a biochemical mechanism that can explain in part the variable biochemical features of WND, in particular the normal holo-ceruloplasmin levels observed in some patients. Our data have direct implications for WND diagnosis, indicating that decreased serum ceruloplasmin concentration is not likely to be observed with certain genetic variants of WND.</text></passage></document><document><id>240</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Adenomatous polyposis families that screen APC mutation-negative by conventional methods are genetically heterogeneous.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>120</offset><text>PURPOSE: One third of families with classical adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and a majority of those with attenuated FAP (AFAP), remain APC mutation-negative by conventional methods. Our purpose was to clarify the genetic basis of polyposis and genotype-phenotype correlations in such families. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a cohort of 29 adenomatous polyposis families that had screened APC mutation-negative by the protein truncation test, heteroduplex analysis, and exon-specific sequencing. The APC gene was investigated for large genomic rearrangements by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and for allelic mRNA expression by single nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE). The AXIN2 gene was screened for mutations by sequencing. RESULTS: Four families (14%) showed a constitutional deletion of the entire APC gene (three families) or a single exon (one family). Seven families (24%) revealed reduced or extinct mRNA expression from one APC allele in blood, accompanied by loss of heterozygosity in the APC region in six (75%) of eight tumors. In 15 families (52%), possible APC involvement could be neither confirmed nor excluded. Finally, as detailed elsewhere, three families (10%) had germline mutations in genes other than APC, AXIN2 in one family, and MYH in two families. CONCLUSION: "APC mutation-negative" FAP is genetically heterogeneous, and a combination of MLPA and SNuPE is able to link a considerable proportion (38%) to APC. Significant differences were observed in clinical manifestations between subgroups, emphasizing the importance of accurate genetic and clinical characterization for the proper management of such families.</text></passage></document><document><id>241</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A t(1;22)(p13;q13) in four children with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7), two with Down syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>We report four children with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML-M7) and t(1;22)(p13;q13), two of them with Down syndrome; their ages were 7 months, and 6, 7, and 10 years.

More than 130 different molecular abnormalities have been described worldwide, with considerable variation in the enzyme among various racial groups. Data from Kuwaiti populations are scarce, and the studies available are the result of screening male blood donors who may not be truly representative of the Kuwaiti population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the mutation spectrum of the G6PD gene among Kuwaiti Arabs. DESIGN: DNA was extracted from 82 G6PD-deficient Kuwaiti subjects (75 men and 7 women) and screened for gene mutations using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct sequencing. A total of 1209 randomly selected Kuwaiti adult subjects of both sexes were then screened for any characterized mutation. RESULTS: G6PD Mediterranean(563C-->T), and A-(202G-->A,376A-->G) genotypes were characterized as the most common variants among the G6PD-deficient population, representing 0.742 and 0.124 allele frequencies, respectively. The 2 previously described mutations, G6PD Chatham(1003G-->A) and Aures(143T-->C), were found at lower frequencies (0.101 and 0.034, respectively). The allele frequencies for these 4 G6PD variants among the randomly selected Kuwaitis were 0.035, 0.0074, 0.0046, and 0.0023 for Mediterranean, A-, Chatham, and Aures, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has characterized the molecular heterogeneity of G6PD variants among ethnic Kuwaitis. The findings suggest that gene flow from the Indian subcontinent, sub-Saharan African, and other parts of the Mediterranean may have contributed to the observed G6PD mutations seen in the Kuwaiti population.</text></passage></document><document><id>243</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Unique maternal deletion of 15q in a patient with some symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Human chromosome 15q11-q13 is a critical region for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) and most of the genes are under the condition of imprinting mechanism. PWS results from the loss of expression of paternally expressed genes and AS of maternally expressed genes. In this study molecular studies about a patient with congenital anomalies and mental retardation are analyzed. METHODS: Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were analyzed by PCR. These markers exist within 15q11-q13 and distal to 15q13. RESULTS: Only the maternal D15S986 locus within 15q11-q13 was deleted and other markers were biallelic. CONCLUSIONS: The result of maternal small region deletion in this patient is different from the typical PWS with paternal chromosome deletion and it suggests that nearby the deleted region there exists a gene (genes) which is not imprinted but needs biallelic expression.</text></passage></document><document><id>244</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prevalence of GH-1 gene deletion in patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency in Japan.

Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood samples of 48 patients (34 males and 14 females) at 20 hospitals. All the patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria as follows: (1) IGHD patients whose every peak serum GH level in more than two tests &lt;5 ng/ml and (2) pretreatment height &lt; -- 3SD, regardless of family history and facial feature characteristic of GH-1 gene deletion. The subjects were screened for deletions in GH-1 gene, using a PCR method that could identify deletions of 6.7, 7.0 and 7.6 kbp. Three (6.25%) out of 48 subjects were found to have such deletion fragments. The first case was a boy homozygous for deletion of 6.7 kbp fragments. The second case was a girl heterozygous for 6.7 kbp deletion. A direct sequence analysis revealed a 2-bp deletion in exon 3 on the remaining allele that created a stop codon in exon 4. The third case was a boy also heterozygous for 6.7 kbp deletion. By direct sequencing analysis, three point mutations were detected in the promoter region on the opposite allele together with a four-base addition at base 250. One of the mutations was in the area of Pit-1 binding site (at base - 123). The latter two cases apparently represent new types of compound heterozygote of GH-1 gene deletion. Our results suggest that GH-1 gene mutation is not so rare in extremely short IGHD children in Japan.</text></passage></document><document><id>245</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Voltage-sensor sodium channel mutations cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis type 2 by enhanced inactivation and reduced current.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>130</offset><text>The pathomechanism of familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is a mystery, despite knowledge of the underlying dominant point mutations in the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) voltage sensor. In five HypoPP families without DHPR gene defects, we identified two mutations, Arg-672-->His and -->Gly, in the voltage sensor of domain 2 of a different protein: the skeletal muscle sodium channel alpha subunit, known to be responsible for hereditary muscle diseases associated with myotonia. Excised skeletal muscle fibers from a patient heterozygous for Arg-672-->Gly displayed depolarization and weakness in low-potassium extracellular solution. Slowing and smaller size of action potentials were suggestive of excitability of the wild-type channel population only. Heterologous expression of the two sodium channel mutations revealed a 10-mV left shift of the steady-state fast inactivation curve enhancing inactivation and a sodium current density that was reduced even at potentials at which inactivation was removed. Decreased current and small action potentials suggested a low channel protein density. The alterations are decisive for the pathogenesis of episodic muscle weakness by reducing the number of excitable sodium channels particularly at sustained membrane depolarization. The results prove that SCN4A, the gene encoding the sodium channel alpha subunit of skeletal muscle is responsible for HypoPP-2 which does not differ clinically from DHPR-HypoPP. HypoPP-2 represents a disease caused by enhanced channel inactivation and current reduction showing no myotonia.</text></passage></document><document><id>246</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The major histocompatibility complex-encoded HFE in iron homeostasis and immune function.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>HFE is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I molecule that complexes with a beta2-microglobulin. A functional link between HFE and iron metabolism has been established by the discovery of a physical association between HFE and the transferrin receptor. By inhibiting transferrin receptor internalization, HFE functions as a negative modulator of transferrin receptor function. In addition, HFE appears to be an iron sensor that directly or indirectly communicates the body's iron status to T cells, which then use cytokines as feedback modulators to achieve iron homeostasis. A working model for the feedback regulatory mechanism between iron metabolism and immune function is proposed.</text></passage></document><document><id>247</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Low levels of high density lipoproteins in Turks, a population with elevated hepatic lipase.

Here we report that Turks have low levels of high density lipoprotein subclass 2 (HDL(2)), apoA-I-containing lipoproteins (LpA-I), and pre-beta-1 HDL and increased levels of HDL(3) and LpA-I/A-II particles (potentially an atherogenic lipid profile). The frequency distributions of HDL-C and LpA-I levels were skewed toward bimodality in Turkish women but were unimodal in Turkish men. The apoE genotype affected HDL-C and LpA-I levels in women only. In women, but not men, the varepsilon2 allele was strikingly more prevalent in those with the highest levels of HDL-C and LpA-I than in those with the lowest levels. The higher prevalence of the epsilon2 allele in these subgroups of women was not explained by plasma triglyceride levels, total cholesterol levels, age, or body mass index. The modulating effects of apoE isoforms on lipolytic hydrolysis of HDL by hepatic lipase (apoE2 preventing efficient hydrolysis) or on lipoprotein receptor binding (apoE2 interacting poorly with the low density lipoprotein receptors) may account for differences in HDL-C levels in Turkish women (the epsilon2 allele being associated with higher HDL levels). In Turkish men, who have substantially higher levels of hepatic lipase activity than women, the modulating effect of apoE may be overwhelmed. The gender-specific impact of the apoE genotype on HDL-C and LpA-I levels in association with elevated levels of hepatic lipase provides new insights into the metabolism of HDL.</text></passage></document><document><id>248</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Defective radiation signal transduction in ataxia-telangiectasia cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>PURPOSE: The product of the gene ATM mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is predominantly present in the nucleus Compatible with a role in DNA-damage recognition and cell-cycle control. However, ATM is also present outside the nucleus in cytoplasmic and membrane associated vesicles, which may explain the more general signalling defect in A-T. This led us to investigate signalling events initiated by ionizing radiation, remote from the nucleus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A-T and control lymphoblastoid cells were employed to study radiation-induced signalling at the level of protein activation using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Flow cytometry was used to determine mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. RESULTS: Lymphoblastoid cells from A-T patients were found to be defective in the radiation-induced activation of protein tyrosine kinase p53/p56lyn. In control cells Ca2+ was mobilized in response to gamma-radiation largely from internal stores, and increased significantly over a 20 min period. This mobilization of Ca2+ was either absent or increased very slowly in A-T cells post-irradiation. The same pattern of release was observed after treatment with the radiometric agent, streptonigrin. In addition the phospatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin suppressed the release of Ca2+. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that ionizing radiation activates lyn kinase and leads to the release of Ca2+, and-for the first time-that these steps are ATM-dependent.</text></passage></document><document><id>249</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Refined localization of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness DFNB10 locus using 34 novel microsatellite markers, genomic structure, and exclusion of six known genes in the region.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>185</offset><text>An autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness locus, DFNB10, was previously localized to a 12-cM region near the telomere of chromosome 21 (21q22.3).

We have identified and ordered a total of 50 polymorphic microsatellite markers in 21q22.3, comprising 16 published and 34 new markers, precisely mapped and ordered on BAC/cosmid contigs. Using these microsatellite markers, the locus for DFNB10 has been refined to an area of less than 1 Mb between markers 1016E7.CA60 and 1151C12.GT45. Six previously published cDNAs were mapped to this critical region, and their genomic structures were determined to facilitate mutation analysis in DFNB10. All six genes in this region (in order from centromere to telomere: White/ABCG1, TFF3, TFF2, TFF1, PDE9A, and NDUVF3) have been screened and eliminated as candidates for DFNB10. The new microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in this study should enable the refined mapping of other genetic diseases that map to 21q22.3. In addition, the critical region for DFNB10 has been reduced to a size amenable to an intensive positional cloning effort.</text></passage></document><document><id>250</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>C21orf5, a novel human chromosome 21 gene, has a Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog (pad-1) required for embryonic patterning.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>To contribute to the development of the transcription map of human chromosome 21 (HC21), we isolated a new transcript, C21orf5 (chromosome 21 open reading frame 5), encoding a predicted 2298-amino-acid protein. Analysis of the genomic DNA sequence revealed that C21orf5 consists of 37 exons that extend over 130 kb and maps between the CBR3 (carbonyl reductase 3) and the KIAA0136 genes. Northern blot analyses showed a ubiquitously expressed RNA species of 8.5 kb. RNA in situ hybridization on brain sections of normal human embryos revealed a strong labeling in restricted areas of the cerebral cortex. In silico analysis of the deduced C21orf5 protein revealed several highly probable transmembrane segments but no known protein domains or homology with known proteins. However, there were significant homologies to several hypothetical Caenorhabditis elegans proteins and Drosophila melanogaster genomic sequences. To investigate the function of C21orf5, we isolated the cDNA of the C. elegans ortholog and performed double-stranded RNA-mediated genetic interference experiments. The major phenotype observed in the progeny of injected animals was embryonic lethality. Most of the tissues of the embryo failed to undergo proper patterning during gastrulation, and morphogenesis did not occur; thus we termed the ortholog pad-1, for patterning defective 1. These results indicated that pad-1 is essential for the development and the survival of C. elegans. This study provides the first example of the use of C. elegans as a model to study the function of genes on human chromosome 21 that might be involved in Down syndrome.</text></passage></document><document><id>251</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Complex patterns of inheritance of an imprinted murine transgene suggest incomplete germline erasure.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>102</offset><text>Here we report a transgenic mouse line that exhibits significant deviations from a classic pattern of parental imprinting. When the transgene is passed through the female germline, it is completely silenced in some offspring while in others expression is reduced. This variable expressivity does not appear to be the result of differences in the presence of unlinked modifiers. Female transmission of the transgene is associated with hypermethylation. The transgene is generally reactivated on passage through the male germline. Extended pedigrees reveal complex patterns of inheritance of the phenotype. The most likely explanation for this result is that the imprint is not completely erased and reset when passed through the germline of either sex. FISH analysis reveals that the transgene has integrated into chromosome 3 band E3, a region not known to carry imprinted genes, and the integration site shows no sign of allele-specific differential methylation. These findings, in conjunction with other recent work, raise the possibility that the introduction of foreign DNA into the mammalian genome, either through retrotransposition or transgenesis, may be associated with parental imprinting that is not always erased and reset during meiosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>252</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Defective peroxisome membrane synthesis due to mutations in human PEX3 causes Zellweger syndrome, complementation group G.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>Zellweger cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome is a severe congenital disorder associated with defective peroxisomal biogenesis. At least 23 PEX genes have been reported to be essential for peroxisome biogenesis in various species, indicating the complexity of peroxisomal assembly. Cells from patients with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders have previously been shown to segregate into >/=12 complementation groups. Two patients assigned to complementation group G who had not been linked previously to a specific gene defect were confirmed as displaying a cellular phenotype characterized by a lack of even residual peroxisomal membrane structures. Here we demonstrate that this complementation group is associated with mutations in the PEX3 gene, encoding an integral peroxisomal membrane protein. Homozygous PEX3 mutations, each leading to C-terminal truncation of PEX3, were identified in the two patients, who both suffered from a severe Zellweger syndrome phenotype. One of the mutations involved a single-nucleotide insertion in exon 7, whereas the other was a single-nucleotide substitution eight nucleotides from the normal splice site in the 3' acceptor site of intron 10. Expression of wild-type PEX3 in the mutant cell lines restored peroxisomal biogenesis, whereas transfection of mutated PEX3 cDNA did not. This confirmed that the causative gene had been identified. The observation of peroxisomal formation in the absence of morphologically recognizable peroxisomal membranes challenges the theory that peroxisomes arise exclusively by growth and division from preexisting peroxisomes and establishes PEX3 as a key factor in early human peroxisome synthesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>253</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 carriers is modified by the HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset><text>Women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene ( on chromosome 17q21 ) , have an 80 % risk of breast cancer and a 40 % risk of ovarian cancer by the age of 70 ( ref . 1 ) .

MTF-1 contains six zinc fingers of the Cys(2)-His(2) type. It was previously shown that MTF-1 is reversibly activated to bind DNA in response to changes in zinc status, unlike other zinc finger transcription factors, which do not appear to be reversibly activated by zinc in the cellular environment. Here we show that zinc fingers 2-4 constitute the core DNA-binding domain, whereas fingers 5 and 6 appear to be unnecessary for DNA binding in vitro. Deletion of finger 1 resulted in a protein that bound DNA constitutively in vitro. Furthermore, transfer of MTF-1 finger 1 to a position immediately preceding the three zinc fingers of Sp1 resulted in a chimeric protein that required exogenous zinc to activate DNA binding in vitro, unlike native Sp1, which binds DNA constitutively. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that intact MTF-1 activated a reporter 2.5-4-fold above basal levels after metal treatment in mouse MTF-1 knockout cells, Drosophila SL2 cells, and yeast. However, the metal response was lost in all three systems when finger 1 was deleted, but was unaffected by deletion of fingers 5 and 6. These data suggest that finger 1 of MTF-1 constitutes a unique metal-sensing domain that, in cooperation with the transactivation domains, produces a zinc-sensing metalloregulatory transcription factor.</text></passage></document><document><id>255</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of meiotic segregation, using single-sperm typing: meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy locus. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency , in the human population , of DM chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state .

Recently it has been reported that a member of the histone H2A family, H2AX, becomes extensively phosphorylated within 1-3 minutes of DNA damage and forms foci at break sites. RESULTS: In this work, we examine the role of H2AX phosphorylation in focus formation by several repair-related complexes, and investigate what factors may be involved in initiating this response. Using two different methods to create DNA double-strand breaks in human cells, we found that the repair factors Rad50 and Rad51 each colocalized with phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) foci after DNA damage. The product of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 also colocalized with gamma-H2AX and was recruited to these sites before Rad50 or Rad51. Exposure of cells to the fungal inhibitor wortmannin eliminated focus formation by all repair factors examined, suggesting a role for the phosphoinositide (PI)-3 family of protein kinases in mediating this response. Wortmannin treatment was effective only when it was added early enough to prevent gamma-H2AX formation, indicating that gamma-H2AX is necessary for the recruitment of other factors to the sites of DNA damage. DNA repair-deficient cells exhibit a substantially reduced ability to increase the phosphorylation of H2AX in response to ionizing radiation, consistent with a role for gamma-H2AX in DNA repair. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of gamma-H2AX foci that is established within a few minutes of DNA damage accounts for the patterns of Rad50, Rad51, and Brca1 foci seen much later during recovery from damage. The evidence presented strongly supports a role for the gamma-H2AX and the PI-3 protein kinase family in focus formation at sites of double-strand breaks and suggests the possibility of a change in chromatin structure accompanying double-strand break repair.</text></passage></document><document><id>258</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Heterozygous expansion of the GAA tract of the X25/frataxin gene is associated with insulin resistance in humans.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>114</offset><text>Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease that has been attributed to a GAA triplet repeat expansion in the first intron of the X25/frataxin gene. Impaired glucose tolerance is present in up to 39% of FA patients, and clinically apparent diabetes is seen in approximately 18% of the affected individuals. Subjects carrying the X25/frataxin GAA repeat in a heterozygous state do not develop FA and, therefore, represent an ideal model to study the underlying metabolic defects that contribute to the diabetes associated with this disorder. In the present study, we have compared 11 first-degree relatives of FA patients (i.e., parents or heterozygous siblings of FA patients) with matched normal control subjects to study the parameters of glucose metabolism. An oral glucose tolerance test revealed diabetes in one of the heterozygous subjects who was excluded from further analyses. Using an octreotide-based quantification of insulin sensitivity, 8 of the remaining 10 study subjects showed pronounced insulin resistance, reflecting a significant difference from the control group (P = 0.001). In conclusion, a heterozygous expansion of the X25/frataxin GAA repeat in healthy individuals is associated with insulin resistance and might be considered a genetic co-factor in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial subtypes of diabetes.</text></passage></document><document><id>259</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Alterations of adenomatous polyposis Coli (APC) gene in oral squamous cell carcinoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset><text>The present study assessed the roles of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene during oral carcinogenesis.

The apparent APC heterozygosity (27%) in non-cancerous matched oral tissue (NCMOT) adjacent to OSCC at an exon 11 locus was significantly lower than normally found in the Taiwanese population (49%). These findings suggest that the allelic status of APC could indicate a cancer risk. No polymorphism of 11307 allele of APC was identified in NCMOT or OSCC.

Thus, we compared the systemic and local inflammatory responses induced by the parasite, and the outcome of infection, between congenic C5-sufficient (B10.D2 n/SnJ) and C5-deficient (B10.D2 o/SnJ) mice challenged with protoscoleces. Indirect evidence of in-vivo complement activation during the establishment phase was obtained; infection induced serum amyloid P and eosinophil responses which were dependent on C5. Early recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells was not dependent on the presence of C5. The higher capacity of C5-sufficient mice to recruit eosinophils was also observed during the cystic phase of infection, and mice recruiting more eosinophils developed lower parasite masses. Analysis of the outcome of infection after 8 months showed that C5-sufficient mice were more resistant to infection than C5-deficient mice in terms of individuals with no cysts; this trend was not statistically significant. In addition, C5-deficient mice developed higher numbers of large (> 5 mm in diameter) cysts and higher cyst weights than C5-sufficient mice indicating that C5-mediated mechanisms are detrimental for parasite growth. Taken together, our results suggest that complement, through C5-mediated effectors, contributes to host defences by both restricting the establishment of infection and controlling the growth of established cysts. This contribution may, at least partially, be associated with the ability of C5a to promote eosinophil infiltration.</text></passage></document><document><id>261</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Role of Cl- in electrogenic Na+-coupled cotransporters GAT1 and SGLT1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>71</offset><text>We have investigated the functional role of Cl(-) in the human Na(+)/Cl(-)/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Na(+)/glucose cotransporters (GAT1 and SGLT1, respectively) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Substrate-evoked steady-state inward currents were examined in the presence and absence of external Cl(-). Replacement of Cl(-) by gluconate or 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid decreased the apparent affinity of GAT1 and SGLT1 for Na(+) and the organic substrate. In the absence of substrate, GAT1 and SGLT1 exhibited charge movements that manifested as pre-steady-state current transients. Removal of Cl(-) shifted the voltage dependence of charge movements to more negative potentials, with apparent affinity constants (K(0.5)) for Cl(-) of 21 and 115 mm for SGLT1 and GAT1, respectively. The maximum charge moved and the apparent valence were not altered. GAT1 stoichiometry was determined by measuring GABA-evoked currents and the unidirectional influx of (36)Cl(-), (22)Na(+), or [(3)H]GABA. Uptake of each GABA molecule was accompanied by inward movement of 2 positive charges, which was entirely accounted for by the influx of Na(+) in the presence or absence of Cl(-). Thus, the GAT1 stoichiometry was 2Na(+):1GABA. However, Cl(-) was transported by GAT1 because the inward movement of 2 positive charges was accompanied by the influx of one Cl(-) ion, suggesting unidirectional influx of 2Na(+):1Cl(-):1GABA per transport cycle. Activation of forward Na(+)/Cl(-)/GABA transport evoked (36)Cl(-) efflux and was blocked by the inhibitor SKF 89976A. These data suggest a Cl(-)/Cl(-) exchange mechanism during the GAT1 transport cycle. In contrast, Cl(-) was not transported by SGLT1. Thus, in both GAT1 and SGLT1, Cl(-) modulates the kinetics of cotransport by altering Na(+) affinity, but does not contribute to net charge transported per transport cycle. We conclude that Cl(-) dependence per se is not a useful criterion to classify Na(+) cotransporters.</text></passage></document><document><id>262</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sensitivity and specificity of clinical criteria for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer associated mutations in MSH2 and MLH1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>135</offset><text>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are multiple criteria for the clinical diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). The value of several of the newer proposed diagnostic criteria in identifying subjects with mutations in HNPCC associated mismatch repair genes has not been evaluated, and the performance of the different criteria have not been formally compared with one another. METHODS: We classified 70 families with suspected hereditary colorectal cancer (excluding familial adenomatous polyposis) by several existing clinical criteria for HNPCC, including the Amsterdam criteria, the Modified Amsterdam criteria, the Amsterdam II criteria, and the Bethesda criteria. The results of analysis of the mismatch repair genes MSH2 and MLH1 by full gene sequencing were available for a proband with colorectal neoplasia in each family. The sensitivity and specificity of each of the clinical criteria for the presence of MSH2 and MLH1 mutations were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 70 families, 28 families fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria, 39 fulfilled the Modified Amsterdam Criteria, 34 fulfilled the Amsterdam II criteria, and 56 fulfilled at least one of the seven Bethesda Guidelines for the identification of HNPCC patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the Amsterdam criteria were 61% (95% CI 43-79) and 67% (95% CI 50-85). The sensitivity of the Modified Amsterdam and Amsterdam II criteria were 72% (95% CI 58-86) and 78% (95% CI 64-92), respectively. Overall, the most sensitive criteria for identifying families with pathogenic mutations were the Bethesda criteria, with a sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 88-100); the specificity of these criteria was 25% (95% CI 14-36). Use of the first three criteria of the Bethesda guidelines only was associated with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 49% (95% CI 34-64). CONCLUSIONS: The Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for use as a sole criterion for determining which families should undergo testing for MSH2 and MLH1 mutations. The Modified Amsterdam and the Amsterdam II criteria increase sensitivity, but still miss many families with mutations. The most sensitive clinical criteria for identifying subjects with pathogenic MSH2 and MLH1 mutations were the Bethesda Guidelines; a streamlined version of the Bethesda Guidelines may be more specific and easier to use in clinical practice.</text></passage></document><document><id>263</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Role of the cerebellar flocculus region in the coordination of eye and head movements during gaze pursuit.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>The contribution of the flocculus region of the cerebellum to horizontal gaze pursuit was studied in squirrel monkeys.

The question addressed in this study was whether the flocculus region of the cerebellum also plays a role in canceling the VOR produced by active head movements during gaze pursuit. The firing behavior of 121 Purkinje (Pk) cells that were sensitive to horizontal smooth pursuit eye movements was studied. The sample included 66 eye velocity Pk cells and 55 gaze velocity Pk cells. All of the cells remained sensitive to smooth pursuit eye movements during combined eye and head tracking. Eye velocity Pk cells were insensitive to smooth pursuit head movements. Gaze velocity Pk cells were nearly as sensitive to active smooth pursuit head movements as they were passive whole body rotation; but they were less than half as sensitive ( approximately 43%) to smooth pursuit head movements as they were to smooth pursuit eye movements. Considered as a whole, the Pk cells in the flocculus region of the cerebellar cortex were &lt;20% as sensitive to smooth pursuit head movements as they were to smooth pursuit eye movements, which suggests that this region does not produce signals sufficient to cancel the VOR during smooth head tracking. The comparative effect of injections of muscimol into the flocculus region on smooth pursuit eye and head movements was studied in two monkeys. Muscimol inactivation of the flocculus region profoundly affected smooth pursuit eye movements but had little effect on smooth pursuit head movements or on smooth tracking of visual targets when the head was free to move. We conclude that the signals produced by flocculus region Pk cells are neither necessary nor sufficient to cancel the VOR during gaze pursuit.</text></passage></document><document><id>264</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Coincidence of two novel arylsulfatase A alleles and mutation 459+1G>A within a family with metachromatic leukodystrophy: molecular basis of phenotypic heterogeneity. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>167</offset><text>In a family with three siblings , one developed classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) , fatal at age 5 years , with deficient arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) activity and increased galactosylsulfatide ( GS ) excretion .

Mutation screening and sequence analysis disclosed the involvement of three different ARSA mutations being the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity . The late infantile patient inherited from his mother the frequent 0-type mutation 459 + 1G > A , and from his father a novel , single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 ( 7delG ) . The two clinically unaffected siblings carried the maternal mutation 459 + 1G > A and , on their paternal allele , a novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8 , resulting in substitution of alanine 464 by valine ( A464V ) . The fathers genotype thus was 7delG / A464V . Mutation A464V was not found in 18 unrelated MLD patients and 50 controls . A464V , although clearly modifying ARSA and GS levels , apparently bears little significance for clinical manifestation of MLD , mimicking the frequent ARSA pseudodeficiency allele . Our results demonstrate that in certain genetic conditions MLD-like ARSA and GS values need not be paralleled by clinical disease , a finding with serious diagnostic and prognostic implications . Moreover , further ARSA alleles functionally similar to A464V might exist which , together with 0-type mutations , may cause pathological ARSA and GS levels , but not clinical outbreak of the disease . . </text></passage></document><document><id>265</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Gene mutation in hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation (HPD), strictly defined dopa-responsive dystonia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>Mutations of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-cyclohydrolase I (GCH-I) gene, which catalyzes the first step in the tetrahydrobiopterin (the natural cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase) biosynthesis, are demonstrated to cause HPD, i.e. strictly defined dopa-responsive dystonia. We analyzed the GCH-I gene of patients who fulfilled clinical criteria for typical hereditary progressive dystonia (HPD) to finalize the diagnosis. Two novel point mutations in two independent families and one novel de novo point mutation in one sporadic patient were identified. In a Japanese family, a T-to-C transition was found at exon 2, which resulted in a substitution of Cys 141 to Arg. In another Japanese family, a C-to-T mutation in exon 4 caused a nonsense codon Gln180Stop. In a clinically sporadic Japanese patient, T-to-G transition in exon 1 brought Met 102 Arg missense mutation, which was not observed in its biological parents. These three mutations were not observed in previously reported 57 pedigrees/patients and no polymorphisms in the coding region of the GCH-I gene were identified. None of the mutations of GCH-I gene in HPD reported to date or in this study have been detected more than once in any ethnicity suggesting a relatively high spontaneous mutation rate in this gene.</text></passage></document><document><id>266</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 is secreted and exhibits properties of a granin. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>55</offset><text>Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast and ovarian cancer .

We found a recessive GTPCH mutation (R249S, 747C-->G in a dystonia patient. Her PHA-stimulated mononuclear blood cells had a normal amount of GTPCH mRNA, but low GTPCH activity. Arginine 249 is located at the C-terminus of GTPCH, outside the catalytic site. E. coli expressed recombinant R249S mutant protein possessed normal enzyme activity and kinetics. However, in transfected eukaryotic cells, R249S mutant protein expression level was lower than the wild-type protein. Therefore, this is suspected to be a destabilizing mutation.

The PIGA mutation results in absence or marked deficiency of more than a dozen proteins on PNH blood cells. Current flow cytometric assays for PNH rely on the use of labeled antibodies to detect deficiencies of specific GPI anchor proteins, such as CD59. However, because no single GPI anchor protein is always expressed in all cell lineages, no one monoclonal antibody can be used with confidence to diagnose PNH. We describe a new diagnostic test for PNH, based on the ability of a fluorescently labeled inactive variant of the protein aerolysin (FLAER) to bind selectively to GPI anchors. We compared GPI anchor protein expression in 8 patients with PNH using FLAER and anti-CD59. In all cases, FLAER detected similar or higher proportions of PNH monocytes and granulocytes compared with anti-CD59. Because of the increased sensitivity of detection, FLAER could detect small abnormal granulocyte populations in patients to a level of about 0.5%; samples from healthy control subjects contained substantially fewer FLAER-negative cells. FLAER gives a more accurate assessment of the GPI anchor deficit in PNH.</text></passage></document><document><id>270</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Systematic analysis of coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene defects in hereditary coproporphyria and mutation update. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>Hereditary coproporphyria ( HC ) is an acute hepatic porphyria with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase ( CPO ) .

The HPRT gene is situated in the region Xq26-q27.2 and consists of 9 exons. At least 300 different mutations at different sites in the HPRT coding region from exon 1 to exon 9 have been identified. A new mutation in the HPRT gene has been determined in one patient with complete deficiency of erythrocyte activity, with hyperuricemia and gout but without Lesch-Nyhan disease. Analysis of cultured fibroblasts revealed minimal residual HPRT activity mainly when guanine was the substrate. Genomic DNA sequencing demonstrated patient's mother heterozygosity for the mutation and no mutation in her brother. The mutation consists in a C-->T transversion at cDNA base 463 (C463T) in exon 6, resulting in proline to serine substitution at codon 155 (P155S). This mutation had not been reported previously and has been designated HPRT(Sardinia). The mutation identified in this patient allows some expression of functional enzyme in nucleated cells such as fibroblasts, indicating that such cell type may add further information to conventional blood analysis. A multicentre survey gathering patients with variant neurological forms could contribute to understand the pathophysiology of the neurobehavioral symptoms of HPRT deficiency.</text></passage></document><document><id>272</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>von Willebrand disease R1374C: type 2A or 2M?

Twenty-one patients from two large unrelated families and 104 normal controls were studied. VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, FVIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C), bleeding time (BT), PFA(100), and multimeric analysis of VWF were tested. Genetic analysis by sequencing exon 28 on the VWF gene was also carried out. Patients presented lower levels of VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo, a dissociation between VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag, and the presence of all sizes of multimers in plasma VWF. The results for VWF:CB varied depending on the type of collagen used. The genetic analysis showed that the mutation R1374C is responsible for type 2M VWD. A high frequency of the R1374C mutation is observed in northwestern Spain (Galicia). Some types of 2M VWD are misdiagnosed as type 1 VWD. The VWF:CB (with type I collagen) assay was unable to discriminate defective platelet binding of the R1374C VWF. This confirms that VWF:CB cannot substitute for VWF:RCo, and both should be tested when diagnosing VWD.</text></passage></document><document><id>273</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Molecular-genetic analysis of torsion dystonia in Russia].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>For the first time in Russia, analysis of the GCH-I and DYT1 genes was carried out for the purpose of direct DNA diagnostics in families with various forms of hereditary torsion dystonia (TD).

We measured macroscopic and single channel Na currents from cell-attached patches of skeletal myocytes from mice heterozygous (DMPK(+/-)) and homozygous (DMPK(-/-)) for DMPK loss. In DMPK(-/-) myocytes, Na current amplitude was reduced because of reduced channel number. Single channel recordings revealed Na channel reopenings, similar to the gating abnormality of human myotonic muscular dystrophy (DM), which resulted in a plateau of Na current. The gating abnormality deteriorated with increasing age. In DMPK(+/-) muscle there was reduced Na current amplitude and increased Na channel reopenings identical to those in DMPK(-/-) muscle. Thus, these mouse models of complete and partial DMPK deficiency reproduce the Na channel abnormality of the human disease, providing direct evidence that DMPK deficiency underlies the Na channel abnormality in DM.</text></passage></document><document><id>276</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Expression of SIALYL-Le(x) antigen defined by MAb AM-3 is an independent prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>Expression of mucin-bound sialyl-Le(x) antigen during the progression of colorectal carcinoma and its potential prognostic value were analysed in sections of tumours from 182 patients with a documented follow-up by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody (MAb) AM-3.

The percentage of strongly expressing tumours increased with the progression of the disease (UICC stage I = 10%, stage II = 46%, stage III = 63%, stage IV = 68%, p &lt; 0.0001). Seventy-four percent of patients with carcinomas exhibiting a strong sialyl-Le(x) expression but only 34% of patients with weak sialyl-Le(x) expression died of the disease (p = 0.0026). In multivariate analysis, strong sialyl-Le(x) expression increased the relative risk of cancer-related death 3.8-fold (95% CI = 1.8-7.9, p = 0.00034). The separate analyses of patients in UICC stage II (n = 56), III (n =5 9) and IV (n = 57) revealed that strong sialyl-Le(x) expression was associated with a reduction of the 5-year overall survival rate in UICC stage II (84% vs. 54%, p = 0.0013) and in stage III patients (86% vs. 35%, p = 0.0008) after curative resection but was not relevant in patients with distant metastases. In conclusion, the strong expression of sialyl-Le(x) antigen defined by the MAb AM-3 in colorectal carcinomas is an independent unfavourable prognostic factor after curative resection in stage II and III patients. The predictive power of the sialyl-Le(x) expression may be helpful to define subgroups of patients at high risk for whom preventive adjuvant therapy can be selectively applied before the occurrence of detectable metastases.</text></passage></document><document><id>277</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A new betaA1-crystallin splice junction mutation in autosomal dominant cataract.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>PURPOSE: To map the locus for autosomal dominant cataracts (ADCs) in a Brazilian family using candidate gene linkage analyses, describe the clinical variability, and identify potential mutations in the human betaA1-crystallin gene (CRYBA1), a candidate gene identified through linkage studies demonstrating cosegregation with markers on chromosome 17. METHODS: Members of a Brazilian family with ADC were studied. Clinical examinations and linkage analyses with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) polymorphisms of 22 anonymous markers and 2 within the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene were performed; two-point lod scores were calculated. DNA sequences of all 6 exons and 12 exon-intron boundaries of the betaA1-crystallin gene, a proximal candidate gene mapped to 17q11.1-q12 in one unaffected and two affected individuals, were screened and new variants assessed for cosegregation with the disease. RESULTS: Affected individuals exhibited variable expressivity of pulverulent opacities in the embryonal nucleus and sutures; star-shaped, shieldlike, or radial opacities in the posterior embryonal nucleus; and/or midcortical opacities. All known loci for ADC in this family on chromosomes 1 and 13 were excluded. A positive lod score on chromosome 17 was calculated. This ADC locus was mapped to two potential regions on the long arm with an intervening recombination. The only known candidate gene in these regions was betaA1-crystallin. Three previously unreported single nucleotide variants were found in this gene, one in the donor splice junction site of intron C. This variant was found in all affected members and is presumed to be the causative mutation. CONCLUSIONS: An ADC locus was mapped in a Brazilian family with variable expressivity to either 17q23.1-23.2 or 17q11.1-12 based on linkage analyses. Analyses of DNA sequences of the betaA1-crystallin gene in this family revealed three new variants, one of which is within a donor splice junction and cosegregates with affected members.</text></passage></document><document><id>278</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Small evolutionarily conserved RNA, resembling C/D box small nucleolar RNA, is transcribed from PWCR1, a novel imprinted gene in the Prader-Willi deletion region, which Is highly expressed in brain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>199</offset><text>Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the inactivation or deletion of imprinted, paternally expressed genes in chromosome band 15q11.2.

Expressed only from the paternal allele, both genes require the imprinting-center regulatory element for expression and are transcribed from the same strand. They are intronless and do not appear to encode a protein product. High human/mouse sequence similarity (87% identity) is limited to a 99-bp region called "HMCR" (for "human-mouse conserved region"). The HMCR sequence has features of a C/D box small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and is represented in an abundant small transcript in both species. Located in nucleoli, snoRNAs serve as methylation guidance RNAs in the modification of ribosomal RNA and other small nuclear RNAs. In addition to the nonpolyadenylated small RNAs, larger polyadenylated PWCR1 transcripts are found in most human tissues, whereas expression of any Pwcr1 RNAs is limited to mouse brain. Genomic sequence analysis reveals the presence of multiple copies of PWCR1 and Pwcr1 that are organized within local tandem-repeat clusters. On a multispecies Southern blot, hybridization to an HMCR probe encoding the putative snoRNA is limited to mammals.</text></passage></document><document><id>279</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Further examples confirming the existence of Pi null (Pi-).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>The existence of the Pi- allele (Pi null) was envisaged by Talamo when he discovered a subject whose serum contained no alpha-1-antitrypsin.

Reduced NIS activity has been reported in thyroid diseases, including thyroid cancer and congenital hypothyroidism. The study of iodide uptake in thyrocytes has been limited by the availability of appropriate in vitro models. A new culture technique was recently developed that allows normal human thyroid primary culture cells to grow as monolayer cells and express differentiated functions for more than 3 months. We used this technique to study the effect of follicle formation and TSH on iodide uptake in these cells. Iodide uptake by the cells grown in monolayer was very low. Follicle formation was induced from monolayer cells, and electron micrographs demonstrated cell polarity in the follicles. No significant increase in iodide uptake was observed after TSH treatment of cells in monolayer or when follicle formation was induced without TSH. TSH stimulation of follicles, however, significantly increased iodide uptake ( approximately 4. 4-fold; P&lt;0.001). Compared with iodide uptake in monolayers, the combination of follicle formation and TSH treatment stimulated iodide uptake synergistically to 12.0-fold (P&lt;0.001). NIS messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were almost the same in both monolayer cells and follicles. TSH treatment of monolayers and follicles produced significant (P&lt;0.05) stimulation of mRNA ( approximately 4. 8- and approximately 4.3-fold respectively) and protein ( approximately 6.8- and 4.9-fold respectively). TSH stimulated NIS protein levels in both monolayer and follicles, however, stimulation of functional iodide uptake was only seen with TSH stimulation of follicles. The function of NIS may involve post-transcriptional events, such as intracellular sorting, membrane localization of NIS or another NIS regulatory factor. Polarized functions, such as iodide efflux into follicular lumina, may also contribute to the increased iodide concentration after follicle formation.</text></passage></document><document><id>281</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Threonine 68 is required for radiation-induced phosphorylation and activation of Cds1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells use a system of checkpoint controls to delay cell-cycle progression. Checkpoint delays provide time for repair of damaged DNA before its replication in S phase and before segregation of chromatids in M phase. The Cds1 (Chk2) tumour-suppressor protein has been implicated in certain checkpoint responses in mammalian cells. It directly phosphorylates and inactivates the mitosis-inducing phosphatase Cdc25 in vitro and is required to maintain the G2 arrest that is observed in response to gamma-irradiation. Cds1 also directly phosphorylates p53 in vitro at a site that is implicated in its stabilization, and is required for stabilization of p53 and induction of p53-dependent transcripts in vivo upon gamma-ionizing radiation. Thus, Cds1 functions in both the G1 and G2 checkpoint responses. Like Cds1, the checkpoint protein kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) is required for correct operation of both the G1 and G2 damage checkpoints. ATM is necessary for phosphorylation and activation of Cds1 in vivo and can phosphorylate Cds1 in vitro, although evidence that the sites that are phosphorylated by ATM are required for activation is lacking. Here we show that threonine 68 of Cds1 is the preferred site of phosphorylation by ATM in vitro, and is the principal irradiation-induced site of phosphorylation in vivo. The importance of this phosphorylation site is demonstrated by the failure of a mutant, non-phosphorylatable form of Cds1 to be fully activated, and by its reduced ability to induce G1 arrest in response to ionising radiation.</text></passage></document><document><id>282</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Comparison of the interactions of transferrin receptor and transferrin receptor 2 with transferrin and the hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>147</offset><text>The transferrin receptor (TfR) interacts with two proteins important for iron metabolism, transferrin (Tf) and HFE, the protein mutated in hereditary hemochromatosis.

We find no detectable binding between TfR2 and HFE by co-immunoprecipitation or using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay. The affinity of TfR2 for iron-loaded Tf was determined to be 27 nm, 25-fold lower than the affinity of TfR for Tf. These results imply that HFE regulates Tf-mediated iron uptake only from the classical TfR and that TfR2 does not compete for HFE binding in cells expressing both forms of TfR.</text></passage></document><document><id>283</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia.

We investigated the CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.</text></passage></document><document><id>284</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genomic structure of the human plasma prekallikrein gene, identification of allelic variants, and analysis in end-stage renal disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>135</offset><text>Kallikreins are serine proteases that catalyze the release of kinins and other vasoactive peptides. Previously, we have studied one tissue-specific (H. Yu et al., 1996, J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 7: 2559-2564) and one plasma-specific (H. Yu et al., 1998, Hypertension 31: 906-911) human kallikrein gene in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Short sequence repeat polymorphisms for the human plasma kallikrein gene (KLKB1; previously known as KLK3) on chromosome 4 were associated with ESRD in an African American study population. This study of KLKB1 in ESRD has been extended by determining the genomic structure of KLKB1 and searching for allelic variants that may be associated with ESRD. Exon-spanning PCR primer sets were identified by serial testing of primer pairs designed from KLKB1 cDNA sequence and DNA sequencing of PCR products. Like the rat plasma kallikrein gene and the closely related human factor XI gene, the human KLKB1 gene contains 15 exons and 14 introns. The longest intron, F, is almost 12 kb long. The total length of the gene is approximately 30 kb. Sequence of the 5'-proximal promoter region of KLKB1 was obtained by shotgun cloning of genomic fragments from a bacterial artificial clone containing the KLKB1 gene, followed by screening of the clones using exon 1-specific probes. Primers flanking the exons and 5'-proximal promoter region were used to screen for allelic variants in the genomic DNA from ESRD patients and controls using the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. We identified 12 allelic variants in the 5'-proximal promoter and 7 exons. Of note were a common polymorphism (30% of the population) at position 521 of KLKB1 cDNA, which leads to the replacement of asparagine with a serine at position 124 in the heavy chain of the A2 domain of the protein. In addition, an A716C polymorphism in exon 7 resulting in the amino acid change H189P in the A3 domain of the heavy chain was observed in 5 patients belonging to 3 ESRD families. A third polymorphism in the coding sequence was a C699A shift that caused an amino acid change, H183Q. This allele was observed in 8 cases from 6 ESRD families but was not found in any control DNAs. Individually or combined, the allelic variants observed are not statistically associated with ESRD, though in several cases (e.g., H183Q) the small number of people in the population carrying these alleles limits our ability to statistically test for significant association with ESRD. Two new CA/GT repeat polymorphic markers, designated KLK3f and KLK3g, that have heterozygosities of 0.65 and 0.84, respectively, were identified within introns M and N. Analysis using the relative predispositional effect technique indicated that the frequencies of alleles 4 and 8 of KLK3f and allele 8 of KLK3g were significantly different between controls and ESRD cases. They accounted for 0.226, 0.096, and 0.313, respectively, in the probands of 166 ESRD families compared to 0.172, 0.066, and 0.244 in 139 healthy race-matched controls (allele P and total P &lt; 0.05 for all three alleles). Therefore, although polymorphisms in the coding and 5'-proximal promoter of KLKB1 show no statistically significant association with ESRD in African Americans, there is still evidence for association of this part of chromosome 4 with ESRD. This observation suggests that other sequences within or near KLKB1, or another gene nearby, may contribute to ESRD susceptibility.</text></passage></document><document><id>285</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Induction of VEGF gene transcription by IL-1 beta is mediated through stress-activated MAP kinases and Sp1 sites in cardiac myocytes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a multipotent cytokine participating in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we examined the effects of IL-1 beta on the expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and pursued the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect. Treatment of cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes with IL-1 beta increased the levels of VEGF mRNA in a time- and a concentration-dependent manner. These effects were completely abolished by SB203580 and SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitors) but not by PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor), calphostin C (protein kinase C inhibitor), or genistein (tyrosine kinase inhibitor). While IL-1 beta phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminus protein kinase (JNK) rapidly and transiently, the effect of IL-1 beta on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was gradual and persistent. Transient transfection assays showed that IL-1 beta increases the transcription from the VEGF promoter. A series of 5;-deletion and site-specific mutation analyses indicated that IL-1 beta as well as overexpression of p38 MAPK and JNK activate VEGF promoter activity through two G+C-rich sequences located at -73 and -62. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays showed Sp1 and Sp3 proteins specifically bind to the G+C-rich sequences. The half-life of VEGF mRNA was significantly increased in cells treated with IL-1 beta. Together, these results indicate that IL-1 beta induces VEGF gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and IL-1 beta evokes p38 MAPK and JNK signalings, which in turn stimulate the transcription of the VEGF gene through Sp1-binding sites. These findings suggest the role of IL-1 beta as a cytokine inducing VEGF in cardiac myocytes, and imply that activation of stress-activated MAP kinases regulate Sp1 sites-dependent transcription.</text></passage></document><document><id>286</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>DMSO and glycerol reduce bacterial death induced by expression of truncated N-terminal huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine tracts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of a large gene, IT15, possessing 67 exons. Transgenic mice expressing a truncated N-terminal peptide of huntingtin with an expanded polyglutamine tract translated only from exon 1 develop symptoms similar to Huntington's disease. In the present study, a bacterial system (Escherichia coli) was used to express truncated peptides of huntingtin translated from exon 1 of the HD gene. Bacterial death was observed after the induction of peptides with expanded polyglutamine tracts, and both sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-soluble peptides and insoluble aggregated material were detected by immunoblotting in the homogenates of such E. coli. E. coli death was partially reduced by the addition of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or glycerol to the medium, with a consequent decrease in aggregated material and an increase in SDS-soluble peptide in the homogenate. These results suggest that DMSO and glycerol may decrease the toxicity of huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine tracts by acting as chemical chaperones.</text></passage></document><document><id>287</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Somatic-cell selection is a major determinant of the blood-cell phenotype in heterozygotes for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mutations causing severe enzyme deficiency. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>173</offset><text>X-chromosome inactivation in mammals is regarded as an essentially random process , but the resulting somatic-cell mosaicism creates the opportunity for cell selection .

However , in a small subset of hemizygous males who suffer from chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia , the underlying mutations ( designated class I ) cause more-severe G6PD deficiency , and this might provide an opportunity for selection in heterozygous females during development .

The significant concordance that we have observed in the degree of imbalance in the different blood-cell lineages indicates that a selective mechanism is likely to operate at the level of pluripotent blood stem cells .

This paper develops a simulation of the Ashkenazi population that considers the effects of selection and drift on the mutant allele frequency and the recombinant haplotype frequency over time. Although the fraction of mutants that are linked to the original marker decays exponentially on average, this expected value is not very likely to occur. Instead, due to random loss of the recombinant haplotype, a mutation has a significant probability of retaining complete linkage disequilibrium long after its origin, so there may be large errors in estimating the age of a mutation based on linkage data. The simulations show that the 1226G mutation probably originated between 40 and 1000 generations ago (1000 to 25,000 years ago), and the 84GG mutation probably originated between 50 and 4800 generations ago (1300 to 120,000 years ago). The recent origin of the 1226G mutation and its high current allele frequency provide strong evidence for heterozygote selection. New techniques and results developed in this paper have general applicability toward analyzing linkage disequilibrium near other mutations. For example, they potentially explain the unexpected pattern of linkage disequilibrium seen around the DeltaF508 mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.</text></passage></document><document><id>289</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations in beta-catenin and APC genes are uncommon in esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>Beta-catenin plays important roles in both intercellular adhesion and signal transduction.

The dysregulated APC/beta-catenin pathway has been recently discovered as an important mechanism of tumorigenesis in various cancers, but its role in esophageal adenocarcinomas is not clear. Therefore, we studied the beta-catenin gene mutation, allelic loss of chromosome 5q, and APC gene mutation in esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas. Two (2%) somatic mutations in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene, encompassing the region for glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation, were detected from 109 adenocarcinomas. Chromosomal allelic loss on 5q was frequent in 45.3% (44/97) of tumors. Only one missense mutation in the mutation cluster region of the APC gene was detected from 38 esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas with the 5q allelic loss. Our results based on partial screening mutational analyses indicate that mutations of APC/beta-catenin pathway, unlike in colorectal carcinoma, involve only a small subset of esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.</text></passage></document><document><id>290</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Incidence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in 54 Chilean families with breast/ovarian cancer, genotype-phenotype correlations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>Our aim was to analyze the incidence of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 54 families with breast/ovarian cancer.

PCR amplification of all exons was performed, followed by SSCP, heteroduplex, PTT and sequencing analysis. We identified eight truncation mutations, three in the BRCA1 gene and five in the BRCA2 gene. Three of these mutations have not been reported previously by other groups: 308insA in one family, 3936 C>T in two families, for BRCA1, and 4970insTG in one family for BRCA2. In addition two families having Ashkenazi Jewish ancestors present the well known mutations 185delAG and 6174delT. Interestingly, 5 out of 11 families have mutations recurrent in Spanish families. Among the 54 families selected, seven have breast and ovary cancer cases, and only two presented a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Other cancers as prostate and stomach are frequent among relatives carrying the mutation. Five cases of very early onset (&lt;31 years old) breast cancer were detected. The frequencies of BRCA1 (0.074) and BRCA2 (0.13) mutations in our families is low but similar to the incidence found in other populations, like in Spain. Since is widely known that risk factors that modulate the development of breast cancer such as lifestyle risk factors, geographic location, country of origin and socioeconomic status, besides a familial history of breast cancer our findings suggest that the history of colonization and immigrations is very relevant when studying hereditary factors associated to breast cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>291</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fusion genes resulting from alternative chromosomal translocations are overexpressed by gene-specific mechanisms in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>143</offset><text>Chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential .

The distribution of GAA repeats was also estimated in normal individuals of Indian origin. RESULTS: All patients clinically diagnosed for Friedreich's ataxia were found to be homozygous for GAA repeat expansion. The GAA repeat in the normal population show a bimodal distribution with 94% of alleles ranging from 7-16 repeats. CONCLUSION: Indian patients with expansion at the FRDA locus showed typical clinical features of Friedreich's ataxia.

A powerful antagonist of BMP4 is the secreted polypeptide noggin. A recent case report described a heterozygous 42-bp deletion in the protein-coding region of the noggin gene in a patient with FOP. In order to determine if noggin mutations are a widespread finding in FOP, we examined 31 families with 1 or more FOP patients. Linkage analysis with an array of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers closely linked to the noggin gene was performed in four classically-affected multigenerational FOP families and excluded linkage of the noggin locus to FOP (the multipoint lod score was -2 or less throughout the entire range of markers). We sequenced the noggin gene in affected members of all four families, as well as in 18 patients with sporadic FOP, and failed to detect any mutations. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of 4 of these patients plus an additional 9 patients also failed to reveal any mutations. Among the samples analyzed by SSCP and DNA sequencing was an independently obtained DNA sample from the identical FOP patient previously described with the 42-bp noggin deletion; no mutation was detected. Examination of the DNA sequences of 20 cloned noggin PCR products, undertaken to evaluate the possibility of a somatic mutation in the noggin gene which could be carried by a small subset of white blood cells, also failed to detect the presence of the reported 42-bp deletion. We conclude that mutations in the coding region of noggin are not associated with FOP.</text></passage></document><document><id>296</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>RP1 protein truncating mutations predominate at the RP1 adRP locus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>PURPOSE: Recent reports have shown that the autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) phenotype linked to the pericentric region of chromosome 8 is associated with mutations in a gene designated RP1. Screening of the whole gene in a large cohort of patients has not been undertaken to date. To assess the involvement and character of RP1 mutations in adRP, the gene was screened in a panel of 266 unrelated patients of British origin and a Pakistani family linked to this locus. METHODS: Patients exhibiting the adRP phenotype were screened for mutations in the four exons of the RP1 gene by heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing. Linkage of the Pakistani family was achieved using microsatellite markers. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Alleles were assigned to individuals, which allowed calculation of LOD scores. Microsatellite marker haplotyping was used to determine ancestry of patients carrying the same mutation. RESULTS: In the 266 British patients and 1 Pakistani family analyzed, 21 loss-of-function mutations and 7 amino acid substitutions were identified, some of which may also be disease-causing. The mutations, many of which were deletion or insertion events, were clustered in the 5' end of exon 4. Most mutations resulted in a premature termination codon in the mRNA. Haplotype analysis of nine patients carrying an R677X mutation suggested that these patients are not ancestrally related. CONCLUSIONS: RP1 mutations account for 8% to 10% of the mutations in our cohort of British patients. The most common disease-causing mechanism is deduced to be one involving the presence of a truncated protein. Mutations in RP1 have now been described in adRP patients of four ethnically diverse populations. The different disease haplotype seen in the nine patients carrying the same mutation suggests that this mutation has arisen independently many times, possibly due to a mutation hot spot in this part of the gene.</text></passage></document><document><id>297</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[The heartache of muscular dystrophy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>39</offset><text>Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene, located on the short arm of the X chromosome.

DESIGN: Screening of a genomic library and subsequent restriction map, hybridization and sequencing methods have been employed to characterize the recombinant positive phages. METHODS: A human genomic DNA library was screened by in situ hybridization. Southern blotting experiments were performed to characterize the phage inserts. Intron/exon junction sequences were determined by the Taq polymerase-based chain terminator method. Finally, the thyroglobulin gene was mapped using the Gene Bridge 4 radiation hybrid clone panel. RESULTS: We isolated and characterized four lambda phage clones that include nucleotides 3002 to 4816 of the thyroglobulin mRNA, encompassing exons 12 to 23 of the gene. The exon sizes range between 78 and 219 nucleotides. We found that the GT-AG splicing sequences rule was perfectly respected in all the introns. A total of 7302 intronic bases was analyzed.

Treatment with medium chain triglycerides and L-carnitine in the diet improved his hepatomegaly and cardiomegaly.</text></passage></document><document><id>303</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Color vision defects after central serous chorioretinopathy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset><text>PURPOSE: To reexamine patients diagnosed with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) during the 10-year period from 1987 to 1996 to identify remaining color vision defects in the eyes with normal visual acuity (VA). METHODS: Thirty-nine patients were found with normal VA of 20/20 (logMAR 0) or better 8 to 166 months (mean +/- SD, 58.8 +/- 41.2) after active CSC. Color vision was examined with the Standard Pseudoisochromatic Plates part 2, Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test, and Color Vision Meter 712 anomaloscope. RESULTS: Of the CSC eyes, 26 (67%) had a color vision defect, most of them in the blue area. There was no correlation between the time since the active disease and the results on the color vision tests. Of the contralateral eyes, 19 (49%) also had a color vision defect. CONCLUSION: In many patients some degree of color vision defect remains after CSC even if the VA has recovered to normal. The contralateral eye can also have a color vision defect. This has not been previously reported and might be due to earlier subclinical CSC.</text></passage></document><document><id>304</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evidence for RAD51L1/HMGIC fusion in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>Chromosome rearrangements involving 12q15 are frequently observed in a variety of human mesenchymal tumors. The high mobility group protein gene HMGIC has been identified as the target involved in these rearrangements. Uterine leiomyomas frequently use chromosome band 14q24 as a translocation partner to HMGIC. Recent studies within the chromosome 14 breakpoint region in cell lines carrying t(12;14)(q15;q23-24) revealed that RAD51L1, a member of the RAD51 recombination gene family, is the HMGIC partner. Using RT-PCR, we screened a panel of 81 uterine leiomyomas removed from 30 women for rearrangement between RAD51L1 and HMGIC. This is the first molecular analysis in which primary tumors have been examined for the RAD51L1/HMGIC transcripts. The chimeric transcripts were identified from two cases in which exon 7 of the RAD51L1 gene is fused in frame to either exon 2 or exon 3 of the HMGIC gene. These transcripts encode fusion proteins containing RAD51L1 nucleotide binding domains and the HMGIC protein lacking the N-terminal AT hook motifs. The detection of the RAD51L1/HMGIC fusion in primary tumors adds to the accumulating evidence implicating this fusion in a proportion of uterine leiomyoma patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>305</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a clinic-based series of breast and ovarian cancer families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for a significant proportion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cases. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency of BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutation carrier families in a hospital-based cancer family registry. The frequency of families with germline truncating mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 was 17.3% (18/104) and 1.9% (2/104), respectively. Two novel truncating mutations, BRCA1 1848delGA and BRCA2 5694insT, were identified. We also sought to determine the carrier frequency of other affected family members for which the mutation lineage could be established within these families. Not including the probands, 72% (18/25) of the affected family members within the BRCA1 mutation-associated families were carriers, and all four affected members of the BRCA2 families were carriers. These data imply that risk evaluation based on cancer family history alone may result in inaccurate estimates, and where possible, mutation testing should be considered in other affected family members to verify carrier status.</text></passage></document><document><id>306</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The application of the restriction site mutation assay to compare 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea-induced mutations between the endogenous p53 gene and the transgenic LacZ gene in MutaMouse testes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>188</offset><text>Transgenic mouse modelling has provided a new approach to study the various steps involved in spontaneous and induced mutagenesis in rodent somatic and germline tissues in vivo. However, the important question arises as to whether mutations occur at the same rate in transgenes as in endogenous genes. Here, the restriction site mutation (RSM) assay was used to study mutations induced in the endogenous p53 gene and LacZ transgene of MutaMouse testes treated with 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea (ENU). The aim of these experiments was to compare mutation susceptibility between the endogenous p53 gene and the integrated LacZ gene in the transgenic mouse. ENU-treated and control testes were analysed 102 days after treatment; a total of 297 RSM analyses were performed on ENU-treated and untreated testis DNA. Ten mutational events were detected in the p53 gene (exon 5 and intron 8), two of which occurred in untreated animals and probably represent spontaneous events. Only a single mutation was detected in the LacZ gene of an ENU-treated animal by the RSM assay. Thus the RSM assay can readily detect ENU-induced mutations in the p53 gene, but not in the LacZ transgene. Comparison of the LacZ RSM mutation data with results from a previous study of identically dosed MutaMice in the transgenic selection assay [Ashby, J., Gorelick,N.J. and Shelby,M.D. (1997) Mutat. Res., 388, 111-122] showed that LacZ mutations were far more readily recovered with the MutaMouse transgenic selection assay than by RSM analysis. The reason for the relative inability of the RSM assay to detect LacZ mutations may be the smaller target size of the RSM analysis compared with the transgenic selection assay (16 bases compared with 3000 bases). Taking into account the different target sizes by calculating the mutation frequency per base allowed the RSM data regarding p53 and LacZ to be compared with previously published data from transgenic selection assays. These studies demonstrated that the p53 mutations were present at mutation frequencies (per base) 5- to 70-fold higher than the LacZ gene mutations. In addition, the LacZ mutation frequency per base found in the RSM was an order of magnitude higher than that found in the transgenic selection assay. The transgenic selection assay is more sensitive per locus (due to the larger target of the LacZ gene), as evidenced by ability to detect ENU-induced testes mutations readily.</text></passage></document><document><id>307</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Wxanthema and acute polyarthritis in a young patient].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>56</offset><text>A young woman developed acute polysynovitis and vasculitis-like changes to the skin.

This finding was a surprise; in retrospect this diagnosis would not have been expected in light of the fact that there was no meningism, the patient's general condition was only slightly diminished and the temperatures were subfebrile. Besides an episode of vasculitis, the primary differential diagnosis of acute polysynovitis in young women should include a bacterial infection, for example with Neisseria. Usually, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococci) are involved and, as in the case described, only very rarely Neisseria meningitidis (meningococci).

It is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern and affects certain ethnic groups mainly Jews, Turks, Arabs, and Armenians. FMF is caused by mutations in MEFV gene, which encodes pyrin. This protein is expressed mainly in myeloid/monocytic cells and modulates IL-1beta processing, NF-kappaB activation, and apoptosis. A mutated pyrin probably results in uncontrolled inflammation. The most devastating complication of FMF is amyloidosis, leading to chronic renal failure. M694V homozygocity, male gender and the alpha/alpha genotype of serum amyloid A1 gene are the currently established risk factors for development of amyloidosis. Daily colchicine is the mainstay of the therapy for the disease, resulting in complete remission or marked reduction in the frequency and duration of attacks in most patients. It is also effective in preventing and arresting renal amyloidosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>309</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Phenotype correction in murine mucopolysaccharidosis type VII by transplantation of human amniotic epithelial cells after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>157</offset><text>Cell therapy with human amniotic epithelial (HAE) cells was developed as an alternative method for enzyme replacement therapy in congenital lysosomal storage disorders, but only limited therapeutic efficacy has been reported. A major drawback is insufficient production and secretion of lysosomal enzymes from HAE cells. In this study, we infected HAE cells with an E1-deleted adenoviral vector expressing human beta-glucuronidase (GUSB), and generated cells overexpressing GUSB by a hundred times as much as endogenous GUSB in untreated HAE cells. GUSB secreted from the gene-transferred HAE cells were efficiently transported to murine fibroblasts with endocytosis mediated by mannose-6-phosphate receptors. The cells were administered into the spleen of the mice with the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (B6/MPSVII). Approximately 10-15% of the normal GUSB activity was detected in both liver and spleen 7 days after the cell administration. Histopathological examination showed that lysosomal enlargement in tissue macrophages in the liver and the spleen had disappeared by day 14. These results suggest that transplantation of the HAE cells transduced with adenoviral vectors can be employed for the treatment of congenital lysosomal storage disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>310</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mapping of the autosomal recessive (AR) craniometaphyseal dysplasia locus to chromosome region 6q21-22 and confirmation of genetic heterogeneity for mild AR spondylocostal dysplasia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>183</offset><text>We report on a four-generation inbred family including 10 individuals affected with a form of craniotubular dysplasia (CTD). All affected patients were born to consanguineous healthy parents; this finding, together with the equal sex ratio among affected individuals and the occurrence of only normal individuals among their offspring, indicates that the disease in this family is an autosomal recessive (AR) trait. Taking into account the segregation pattern of the disease in the family and the radiological characteristics of two young CTD patients, the most likely diagnosis for the defect is AR craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD). CMD is a CTD, with both autosomal dominant (AD) and recessive forms. The description of the present genealogy confirms the AR pattern of inheritance of some cases of CMD and contributes to a better delineation of the clinical spectrum of AR CMD, suggesting a more pronounced diaphyseal involvement in the AR compared with the AD CMD. Through genomewide scanning, we mapped the AR CMD to a 7 cM interval, between D6S302 and D6S1639, at 6q21-22 region. We have also excluded the positional candidate COL10A1 gene as being the responsible for this disorder. Curiously, a form of AR spondylocostal dysplasia (SD) also segregates in the family, including one affected individual with both conditions. The gene DLL3, mapped to 19q13 region, was recently found to be responsible for one form of AR SD; however, we did not find evidence of linkage between this 19q region and the SD segregating in our family, thus implying in genetic heterogeneity for AR SD.</text></passage></document><document><id>311</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Ordered subset analysis supports a glaucoma locus at GLC1I on chromosome 15 in families with earlier adult age at diagnosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>Open angle glaucoma (OAG) is a complex disorder with varying etiologies due to multiple genes and environmental effects. This genetic heterogeneity can confound efforts to map loci. Increased homogeneity in a sample can be achieved using either ordered subset analysis (OSA) which groups families, or individual OSA (IOSA), which groups individuals based on disease related covariates. Recently, GLC1I was mapped to 15q11-13 in families with early adult onset of OAG. We tested for linkage to GLC1I in an independent sample of 167 individuals in 25 multiplex OAG families of European descent. We carried out nonparametric linkage analysis on the complete set of 25 families and obtained a maximum LOD score of 1.00 at 9.0 cM. Using mean age at diagnosis (AAD) across the affected individuals within each family to order the families as a proxy for age at onset, we found a maximum OSA LOD score of 2.09 (p=0.021) at 26.1 cM. The mean (+/-s.d.) AAD across the 14 earlier AAD families that contributed to the OSA LOD score was 50.6 years (+/-5.38); the mean AAD for the other 1210 later AAD families that did not contribute to the OSA LOD score (the high-AAD) was 61.7 years (+/-3.50). We also ran IOSA on our families using AAD as our covariate on which to subset affected individuals. The maximum LOD score was 1.01 at 14.3 cM when ordering subjects from early to late AAD. Ordered subset analysis of this sample has provided evidence of linkage close to the previously identified GLC1I glaucoma locus on 15q11-13 in families with middle-aged mean age at diagnosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>312</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A genetic epidemiological study of hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) in Finland: frequent HPCX linkage in families with late-onset disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>139</offset><text>Several predisposition loci for hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) have been suggested, including HPC1 at 1q24-q25 (OMIM #601518) and HPCX at Xq27-q28 (OMIM #300147). Genetically homogeneous populations, such as that of Finland, and distinct subsets of families may help to minimize the genetic heterogeneity that complicates the genetic dissection of complex traits. Here, the role of the HPC1, and HPCX loci in a series of Finnish prostate cancer families was studied, especially in subgroups of families defined by age, number of affected cases, and the mode of disease transmission. DNA samples were collected from 57 Finnish HPC families with at least two living prostate cancer patients. Linkage analysis was carried out with 39 microsatellite markers for the HPC1 region and 22 markers for the HPCX region. The maximum two-point LOD score for the HPCX was 2.05 (marker DXS1205, at theta = 0.14), whereas HPC1 LOD scores were all negative. In HOMOG3R analyses, significant evidence of heterogeneity was observed. Subgroup analyses performed to explore the nature of this heterogeneity indicated that families with no male-to-male (NMM) transmission and a late age of diagnosis (>65 years) accounted for most of the HPCX-linked cases. The maximum HPCX LOD score in this subgroup was 3.12 (theta = 0.001). Nonparametric sibling pair analyses gave a peak LOD score of 3.04 (P &lt; 0.000093) for the NMM transmission subgroup. No subgroup showed any positivity for HPC1. This study suggests that the HPCX-linked prostate cancer families represent a distinct subgroup characterized by NMM transmission of disease and late age of diagnosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>313</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Functional analysis of BRCA1 C-terminal missense mutations identified in breast and ovarian cancer families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>Germline mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 are responsible for the majority of cases involving hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Whereas all truncating mutations are considered as functionally deleterious, most of the missense variants identified to date cannot be readily distinguished as either disease-associated mutations or benign polymorphisms. The C-terminal domain of BRCA1 displays an intrinsic transactivation activity, and mutations linked to disease predisposition have been shown to confer loss of such activity in yeast and mammalian cells. In an attempt to clarify the functional importance of the BRCA1 C-terminus as a transcription activator in cancer predisposition, we have characterized the effect of C-terminal germline variants identified in Scandinavian breast and ovarian cancer families. Missense variants A1669S, C1697R, R1699W, R1699Q, A1708E, S1715R and G1738E and a truncating mutation, W1837X, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays. In addition, four additional missense variants (V1665M, D1692N, S1715N and D1733G) and one in-frame deletion (V1688del) were included in the study. Our findings demonstrate that transactivation activity may reflect a tumor-suppressing function of BRCA1 and further support the role of BRCA1 missense mutations in disease predisposition. We also report a discrepancy between results from yeast- and mammalian-based assays, indicating that it may not be possible to unambiguously characterize variants with the yeast assay alone. We show that transcription-based assays can aid in the characterization of deleterious mutations in the C-terminal part of BRCA1 and may form the basis of a functional assay.</text></passage></document><document><id>314</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The molecular basis of familial hemolytic uremic syndrome: mutation analysis of factor H gene reveals a hot spot in short consensus repeat 20.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>143</offset><text>The aim of the present study was to clarify whether factor H mutations were involved in genetic predisposition to hemolytic uremic syndrome, by performing linkage and mutation studies in a large number of patients from those referred to the Italian Registry for Recurrent and Familial HUS/TTP. PCR and Western blot analyses were conducted to characterize the biochemical consequences of the mutations. Five mutations in the factor H gene were identified. Three, identified in two families and in a sporadic case, are heterozygous point mutations within the most C-terminal short consensus repeat 20 (SCR20) of factor H, resulting in single amino acid substitutions. The other two mutations introduce premature stop codons that interrupt the translation of factor H. A heterozygous nonsense mutation was identified in SCR8 in one family, and a homozygous 24-bp deletion within SCR20 was identified in a Bedouin family with a recessive mode of inheritance. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of cDNA from peripheral blood leukocytes from the Bedouin family showed that the deletion lowered factor H mRNA levels. Although heterozygous mutations were associated with normal factor H levels and incomplete penetrance of the disease, the homozygous mutation in the Bedouin family resulted in severe reduction of factor H levels accompanied by very early disease onset. These data provide compelling molecular evidence that genetically determined deficiencies in factor H are involved in both autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive hemolytic uremic syndrome and identify SCR20 as a hot spot for mutations in the disease. The mutations identified here give an important hint to the relevance of the C-terminus of factor H in the control of the alternative complement activation pathway.</text></passage></document><document><id>315</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Capillary and microchip electrophoresis for rapid detection of known mutations by combining allele-specific DNA amplification with heteroduplex analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>154</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Detection of mutations by gel electrophoresis and allele-specific amplification by PCR (AS-PCR) is not easily scaled to accommodate a large number of samples. Alternative electrophoretic formats, such as capillary electrophoresis (CE) and microchip electrophoresis, may provide powerful platforms for simple, fast, automated, and high-throughput mutation detection after allele-specific amplification. METHODS: DNA samples heterozygous for four mutations (185delAG, 5382insC, 3867G-->T, and 6174delT) in BRCA1 and BRCA2, and homozygous for one mutation (5382insC) in BRCA1 and two mutations (16delAA and 822delG) in PTEN were chosen as the model system to evaluate the capillary and microchip electrophoresis methods. To detect each mutation, three primers, of which one was labeled with the fluorescent dye 6-carboxyfluorescein and one was the allele-specific primer (mutation-specific primer), were used to amplify the DNA fragments in the range of 130-320 bp. AS-PCR was combined with heteroduplex (HD) analysis, where the DNA fragments obtained by AS-PCR were analyzed with the conditions developed for CE-based HD analysis (using a fluorocarbon-coated capillary and hydroxyethylcellulose). The CE conditions were transferred into the microchip electrophoresis format. RESULTS: Three genotypes, homozygous wild type, homozygous mutant, and heterozygous mutant, could be identified by CE-based AS-PCR-HD analysis after 10-25 min of analysis time. Using the conditions optimized with CE, we translated the AS-PCR-HD analysis mutation detection method to the microchip electrophoresis format. The detection of three heterozygous mutations (insertion, deletion, and substitution) in BRCA1 could be accomplished in 180 s or less. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to develop a CE-based method that exploits both AS-PCR and HD analysis for detecting specific mutations. Fast separation and the capacity for automated operation create the potential for developing a powerful electrophoresis-based mutation detection system. Fabrication of multichannel microchip platforms may enable mutation detection with high throughput.</text></passage></document><document><id>316</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification and characterization of an inner ear-expressed human melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA)-like gene (MIAL) with a frequent polymorphism that abolishes translation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>177</offset><text>To discover new cochlea-specific genes as candidate genes for nonsyndromic hearing impairment, we searched in The Institute of Genome Research database for expressed sequence tags isolated from the cochlea only. This led to the cloning and characterization of a human gene named melanoma inhibitory activity-like (MIAL; HGMW-approved symbol OTOR alias MIAL) gene. In situ hybridization revealed MIAL expression in a cell layer beneath the sensory epithelium of cochlea and vestibule of human fetal inner ear. No other human tissue, except fetal brain, showed expression of MIAL when analyzed by in situ hybridization or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA of the mouse homologue was also cloned and mapped about 80 cM from the top of mouse chromosome 2. In mouse, Mial was also expressed in the cochlea and the vestibule of the inner ear, as well as in brain, eye, limb, and ovary. Expression in mammalian cell cultures showed that MIAL is translated as an approximately 15-kDa polypeptide that is assembled into a covalently linked homodimer, modified by sulfation, and secreted from the cells via the Golgi apparatus. In the human MIAL gene, a frequent polymorphism was discovered in the translation initiation codon (ACG instead of ATG). Of 505 individuals, 48 (9.5%) were ATG/ACG heterozygous and 1 (0.2%) was homozygous for ACG. No MIAL protein was synthesized in cells transfected with cDNA of the ACG allele. The inner ear-restricted expression pattern and the existence of an inactive allele suggest that MIAL may contribute to inner-ear dysfunction in humans.</text></passage></document><document><id>317</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An integrated physical map of 8q22-q24: use in positional cloning and deletion analysis of Langer-Giedion syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>116</offset><text>We have developed an integrated map for a 35-cM area of human chromosome 8 surrounding the Langer-Giedion syndrome deletion region.

Screening for the emerin binding protein and immunoprecipitation analysis showed that lamin A binds to emerin specifically. We also used the yeast two-hybrid system to clarify that this interaction requires the top half of the tail domain (amino acid 384-566) of lamin A.

In X-irradiated human cells, HDM2 protein was rapidly phosphorylated in serine/threonine residues in a p53, p14ARF and p73-independent manner. In p53 wild-type cells, HDM2 phosphorylation precedes a detectable increase in the levels of p53 and is not observed in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) fibroblasts. The transfection of AT cells with a vector expressing ATM restored the ability to rapidly phosphorylate HDM2 following X-irradiation, confirming a role for ATM in its phosphorylation. We also show that ATM complexes with HDM2. The DNA lesions signaling the early rapid phosphorylation of HDM2 are a result of X-ray and not UV-type damage. The ATM-promoted early covalent modification of HDM2 in X-irradiated human cells may provide a mechanism to activate p53.</text></passage></document><document><id>320</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Coiling phagocytosis of Borrelia burgdorferi by primary human macrophages is controlled by CDC42Hs and Rac1 and involves recruitment of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and Arp2/3 complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>189</offset><text>Lyme borreliosis is a multisystemic disorder primarily affecting the skin, nervous system, and joints. It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and is transmitted via ticks of the Ixodidae family. Persistence of borreliae within macrophages has been implicated in the often chronic history of borreliosis. The uptake of B. burgdorferi by professional phagocytes occurs predominantly by coiling phagocytosis, a host cell-driven process in which single pseudopods wrap around and engulf the spirochetes. In the present study, we investigated the molecular machinery and the signal transduction pathways controlling the formation of these unique uptake structures. We found that the phagocytosis of borreliae by primary human macrophages is accompanied by the formation of f-actin-rich structures, which in their morphological organization correspond well to the earlier described coiling pseudopods. Further experiments revealed that Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein and Arp2/3 complex, major regulators of actin polymerization, are also recruited to these sites of actin accumulation. In addition, inhibition of an upstream regulator of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein, the Rho-family GTPase CDC42Hs, greatly inhibited the occurrence of borrelia-induced phagocytic uptake structures. Inhibition of Rac1, another Rho family GTPase, had a less-pronounced inhibitory effect, while blocking of Rho activity showed no discernible influence. These results suggest that basic mechanisms of actin polymerization that control other types of phagocytosis are also functional in the formation of the morphologically unique uptake structures in coiling phagocytosis. Our findings should enhance the understanding of the infection process of B. burgdorferi and contribute to devising new strategies for countering Lyme disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>321</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>WFS1 (Wolfram syndrome 1) gene product: predominant subcellular localization to endoplasmic reticulum in cultured cells and neuronal expression in rat brain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>158</offset><text>Wolfram (DIDMOAD) syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy. Recent positional cloning led to identification of the WFS1 (Wolfram syndrome 1) gene, a member of a novel gene family of unknown function. In this study, we generated a specific antibody against the C-terminus of the WFS1 protein and investigated its subcellular localization in cultured cells. We also studied its distribution in the rat brain. Biochemical studies indicated the WFS1 protein to be an integral, endoglycosidase H-sensitive membrane glycoprotein that localizes primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Consistent with this, immunofluorescence cell staining of overexpressed WFS1 showed a characteristic reticular pattern over the cytoplasm and overlapped with the ER marker staining. No co-localization of WFS1 with mitochondria argues against an earlier clinical hypothesis that Wolfram syndrome is a mitochondria-mediated disorder. In the rat brain, at both the protein and mRNA level, WFS1 was found to be present predominantly in selected neurons in the hippocampus CA1, amygdaloid areas, olfactory tubercle and superficial layer of the allocortex. These expression sites, i.e. components of the limbic system or structures closely associated with this system, may be involved in the psychiatric, behavioral and emotional abnormalities characteristic of this syndrome. ER localization of WFS1 suggests that this protein plays an as yet undefined role in membrane trafficking, protein processing and/or regulation of ER calcium homeostasis. These studies represent a first step toward the characterization of WFS1 protein, which presumably functions to maintain certain populations of neuronal and endocrine cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>322</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nonhomologous end-joining of ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-stranded breaks in human tumor cells deficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>133</offset><text>Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes predispose to a wide spectrum of familial cancers. The functions of the proteins encoded by BRCA1 and BRCA2 remain to be elucidated, but their interaction and colocalization with hRAD51 suggest a role in homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. The role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the rejoining of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA DSBs, which may represent a step in the overall process of repair, remains uncertain because recent reports provide conflicting results. Because elucidation of the role of these proteins in DNA DSB rejoining is important for their functional characterization, we reexamined this end point in cells with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2. We show that two pancreatic carcinoma cell lines known to have either wild-type (BxPC3) or mutant forms (Capan-1) of BRCA2 rejoin IR-induced DNA DSBs to a similar extent following biphasic kinetics characterized by a fast and a slow component. Importantly, inactivation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) by wortmannin generates similar shifts from the fast to the slow component of rejoining in BRCA2-proficient and BRCA2-deficient cells. This suggests that the functioning of either the fast, DNA-PK-dependent component or the slow, DNA-PK-independent component of rejoining is not affected by mutations in BRCA2. Also, a human breast cancer cell line with mutated BRCA1 shows normal rejoining of IR-induced DNA DSBs and levels of inhibition by wortmannin commensurate with the degree of DNA-PK inhibition. These observations fail to confirm a direct role for BRCA1 or BRCA2 in the rejoining of IR-induced DSBs in the genome of human tumor cells and, as a result, an involvement in nonhomologous end-joining. They are in line with similar observations with mutants deficient in genes implicated in homologous recombination and support the view that the radiosensitivity to killing of cells deficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2 derives from defects in this repair pathway.</text></passage></document><document><id>323</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Emerin-lacking mice show minimal motor and cardiac dysfunctions with nuclear-associated vacuoles.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset><text>Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an inherited muscular disorder clinically characterized by slowly progressive weakness affecting humero-peroneal muscles, early joint contractures, and cardiomyopathy with conduction block. The X-linked recessive form is caused by mutation in the EMD gene encoding an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, emerin. In this study, mutant mice lacking emerin were produced by insertion of a neomycin resistance gene into exon 6 of the coding gene. Tissues taken from mutant mice lacked emerin. The mutant mice displayed a normal growth rate indistinguishable from their littermates and were fertile. No marked muscle weakness or joint abnormalities were observed; however, rotarod test revealed altered motor coordination. Electrocardiography showed mild prolongation of atrioventricular conduction time in emerin-lacking male mice older than 40 weeks of age. Electron microscopic analysis of skeletal and cardiac muscles from emerin-lacking mice revealed small vacuoles, which mostly bordered the myonuclei. Our results suggest that emerin deficiency causes minimal motor and cardiac dysfunctions in mice with a structural fragility of myonuclei.</text></passage></document><document><id>324</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Loss of heterozygosity in bilateral breast cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>51</offset><text>Women who develop bilateral breast cancer at an early age are likely to harbour germline mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes. The aim of this study was to test for concordant genetic changes in left and right breast cancer of young women (age &lt; 50) with bilateral breast cancer that may suggest an inherited breast cancer predisposition. Microsatellite markers were used to test for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in left and right tumours for 31 women with premenopausal bilateral breast cancer. Markers adjacent to or within candidate genes on 17p (p53), 17q (BRCA1), 13q (BRCA2), 11q (Ataxia Telangiectasia-ATM) and 3p (FHIT) were chosen. Mutational testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 was performed for cases where blood was available. Concordant LOH in both left and right tumours was demonstrated for at least one of the markers tested in 16/31(54%) cases. Where allelic loss was demonstrated for both left and right breast cancer, the same allele was lost on each occasion. This may suggest a common mutational event. Four cases showed concordant loss of alleles in both left and right breast cancer at D17S791 (BRCA1). BRCA1 mutations were identified in two of these cases where blood was available. Four cases showed concordant LOH at D13S155 (BRCA2). Concordant LOH was further demonstrated in seven cases for D11S1778 (ATM) and four cases for D3S1300 (which maps to the FHIT gene), suggesting a possible role for these tumour suppressor genes in this subgroup of breast cancer patients. No concordant allelic loss was demonstrated for D17S786 suggesting that germline mutations in p53 are unlikely in such cases of bilateral breast cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>325</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Linkage of hypertension to chromosome 2q14-q23 in Chinese families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: To identify chromosome regions containing hypertension susceptibility genes in Chinese. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A three-stage study was carried out in Chinese siblings ascertained through outpatient clinics. In the first stage, 283 affected sib-pairs from 79 nuclear families were subjected to a genome-wide scan with 240 microsatellite marker loci. The second stage focused on chromosome 2 with additional markers resulting in an average distance of 5 cM and used an independent sample of 637 affected sib-pairs from 161 families. In the third stage, a fine-scale mapping study on the suggestive region was performed in an independent set of 777 affected sib-pairs from 106 families. Fourteen markers were used with an average distance less than 2 cM. Non-parametric linkage analyses (NPL), parametric linkage analyses and transmission-disequilibrium tests were used to assess evidence for linkage and association. RESULTS: Three markers (D2S168 at 27.06 cM, D2S151 at 152.04 cM and D2S142 at 161.26 cM) on chromosome 2 with suggestive linkage to hypertension susceptibility genes were identified in the genome-wide scan. In stage II, the suggestive region around D2S151 and D2S142 was replicated, while the linkage around D2S168 was not. In the stage III fine-scale mapping study, multipoint linkage analyses showed LOD scores greater than 2.0 throughout a region between 157.16 cM and 162.46 cM (all P &lt; 0.001) with a maximum peak of 2.24 (P= 0.00067) at 160.52 cM. We also observed a NPL Z-score peak of 3.27 at 157.55 cM (P= 0.00086). CONCLUSIONS: The results of a suggestive region on chromosome 2q14-q23 (D2S112-D2S2370) were consistent between each of the three studies. Interestingly, this region overlaps a syntenic region that contains blood pressure quantitative trait loci identified in rat models of hypertension. These data suggest that the region near D2S142 and D2S151 deserves to be further screened for hypertension susceptibility genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>326</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Two mutations of the C7 gene, c.1424G > A and c.281-1G > T, in two Korean families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>Complement C7 deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to meningococcal infection.

METHODS: Rs1h mRNA expression was measured from the eyes of wild-type and rd/rd mice by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Specific antibodies raised against the N terminus of RS1 were used as probes to examine the properties and distribution of RS1 in retina, retinal cell cultures, and transfected COS-1 cells by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Rs1h mRNA expression was detected in the retina of postnatal day (P)11 and adult CD1 mice, but not homozygous rd/rd mice by Northern blot analysis. However, Rs1h expression was detected in rd/rd mice by RT-PCR. RS1 migrated as a single 24-kDa polypeptide under disulfide-reducing conditions and a larger complex (>95 kDa) under nonreducing conditions in the membrane fraction of retinal tissue homogenates and transfected COS-1 cells. RS1 antibodies specifically stained rod and cone photoreceptors and most bipolar cells, but not M  ller cells, ganglion cells, or the inner limiting membrane of adult and developing retina as revealed in double-labeling studies. RS1 antibodies also labeled retinal bipolar cells of photoreceptorless mice and retinal bipolar cells grown in cell culture. CONCLUSIONS: RS1 is expressed and assembled in photoreceptors of the outer retina and bipolar cells of the inner retina as a disulfide-linked oligomeric protein complex. The secreted complex associates with the surface of these cells, where it may function as a cell adhesion protein to maintain the integrity of the central and peripheral retina.</text></passage></document><document><id>329</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fusion of a sequence from HEI10 (14q11) to the HMGIC gene at 12q15 in a uterine leiomyoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>Uterine leiomyoma, a benign smooth-muscle tumor of the myometrium, is the most commonly encountered neoplasm in women of reproductive age. Band q15 of chromosome 12 is often rearranged in benign mesenchymal tumors such as uterine leiomyomas, and the HMGIC gene, encoding a protein of the high-mobility-group (HMG), is present in that region. Using 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE) experiments, we isolated an ectopic sequence that was fused to HMGIC in a uterine leiomyoma. Cloning of the fusion cDNA identified a gene termed rising dbl quote, left (low)homo sapiens enhancer of invasion 10" (HEI10) as the fusion partner. Radiation hybrid mapping revealed that the normal location of HEI10 is at 14q11. In the fusion transcript the first two exons of the HMGIC gene, which encode DNA-binding domains, were fused to the 3' portion of the HEI10 gene. This rearrangement implicates HMGIC in the tumorigenesis of uterine leiomyoma, and suggests that its fusion HMGIC product may play a role in mesenchymal differentiation.</text></passage></document><document><id>330</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype analyses in Cowden disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, two hamartoma syndromes with germline PTEN mutation. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>151</offset><text>The tumour suppressor gene PTEN , which maps to 10q23 . 3 and encodes a 403 amino acid dual specificity phosphatase ( protein tyrosine phosphatase ; PTPase ) , was shown recently to play a broad role in human malignancy .

The transmission pattern of the TPO gene in this family was anomalous; the mother was heterozygous for the deletion; and the mutation was absent in the father. Polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) markers confirmed paternity and demonstrated on chromosome 2 that the propositus was homozygous for most markers on chromosome 2p and that these were identical to one of the maternal 2p homologs. A normal karyotype was found in the propositus, his parents and sister. We conclude that the homozygosity in the patient is due to partial maternal isodisomy of the short arm of chromosome 2, carrying a defective TPO gene. The patient, born small for gestational age, develops and grows well and appears healthy (while being treated with thyroxine) and has a normal phenotype except for a unilateral preauricular skin tag. This shows that partial maternal isodisomy for chromosome 2p (2pter - 2p12) is compatible with a minimal influence on normal development.</text></passage></document><document><id>333</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Absence of CTLA-4 lowers the activation threshold of primed CD8+ TCR-transgenic T cells: lack of correlation with Src homology domain 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>177</offset><text>To examine the role of CTLA-4 in controlling Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell activation, TCR-transgenic/CTLA-4 wild-type or -deficient mice were generated in a recombination-activating gene 2-deficient background. Naive T cells from these mice responded comparably whether or not CTLA-4 was expressed. In contrast, primed T cells responded more vigorously if they lacked CTLA-4 expression. We took advantage of the difference between naive and primed T cell responses to approach the mechanism of CTLA-4 function. Single-cell analyses demonstrated that a greater fraction of CTLA-4-deficient cells responded to a fixed dose of Ag compared with CTLA-4-expressing cells, whereas the magnitude of response per cell was comparable. A shift in the dose-response curve to APCs was also observed such that fewer APCs were required to activate CTLA-4-deficient T cells to produce intracellular IFN-gamma and to proliferate. These results suggest that CTLA-4 controls the threshold of productive TCR signaling. Biochemical analysis comparing stimulated naive and primed TCR-transgenic cells revealed no obvious differences in expression of total CTLA-4, tyrosine-phosphorylated CTLA-4, and associated Src homology domain 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase. Thus, the biochemical mechanism explaining the differential inhibitory effect of CTLA-4 on naive and primed CD8(+) T cells remains unclear.</text></passage></document><document><id>334</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Bilateral optic nerve atrophy in myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>PURPOSE: To document a case of bilateral optic atrophy in a patient with myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder, genetically resulting from an expansion of an unstable CTG repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of a protein kinase gene (DMPK) on chromosome 19q13.3. METHODS: Case report, clinical examination, fundus photographs, visual fields, visual evoked potentials, electroretinograms, and genetic studies of a 56-year-old woman clinically diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy. RESULTS: The patient experienced decreased vision consisting of light perception with the right eye and 20/25 with the left. Fundus examination showed bilateral pallor of the optic disks. Intraocular pressure was normal. Visual field testing, visual evoked potentials, and electroretinogram were abnormal. A pathologic CTG expansion in the myotonic dystrophy gene was found.

The gene product is a sulfate-chloride exchanger of the cell membrane. Inactivation of the sulfate exchanger leads to intracellular sulfate depletion and to the synthesis of undersulfated proteoglycans in susceptible cells such as chondrocytes and fibroblasts. Genotype-phenotype correlations are recognizable, with mutations predicting a truncated protein or a non-conservative amino acid substitution in a transmembrane domain giving the severe phenotypes, and non-transmembrane amino acid substitutions and splice site mutations giving the milder phenotypes. The clinical phenotype is modulated strictly by the degree of residual activity. Over 30 mutations have been observed, including 22 novel mutations reported here. The most frequent mutation, 862C>T (R279W), is a mild mutation giving the rMED phenotype when homozygous and mostly DTD when compounded; occurrence at a CpG dinucleotide and its panethnic distribution suggest independent recurrence. Mutation IVS1+2T>C is the second most common mutation, but is very frequent in Finland. It produces low levels of correctly spliced mRNA, and results in DTD when homozygous. Two other mutations, 1045-1047delGTT (V340del) and 558C>T (R178X), are associated with severe phenotypes and have been observed in multiple patients. Most other mutations are rare. Heterozygotes are clinically unaffected. When clinical samples are screened for radiologic and histologic features compatible with the ACG1B/AO2/DTD/rMED spectrum prior to analysis, the mutation detection rate is high (over 90% of alleles), and appropriate genetic counseling can be given. The sulfate uptake or sulfate incorporation assays in cultured fibroblasts have largely been replaced by mutation analysis, but may still be useful in cases where mutation analysis is not informative. Although supplementation of patients' cultured cells with thiols may bypass the transporter defect and enhance sulfation of proteoglycans, therapeutic approaches are not yet available. Mouse models for this and other disorders of sulfate metabolism are being developed to help in developing therapeutic treatments.</text></passage></document><document><id>336</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Four novel point mutations of factor IX gene detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To identify factor IX gene mutations in patients with hemophilia B.

It functions in vivo as an origin region of DNA replication in the cells in which the gene is repressed (Zhao, Y., Tsutsumi, R., Yamaki, M., Nagatsuka, N., Ejiri, S., Tsutsumi, K., 1994. Initiation zone of DNA replication at the rat aldolase B locus encompasses transcription promoter region. Nucleic Acids Res. 22, 5385-5390). This promoter/origin region has multiple protein-binding sites and, thus, binding of a particular set of protein factors in AldB-expressing or non-expressing cells seems to correlate with functional switch of this promoter/origin region. In the present study, we characterized two closely related proteins, termed AlF-C1 and AlF-C2, which are assumed to be involved in repression of the AldB gene. These two proteins share an identical amino acid sequence except for a 47-residue-insertion in AlF-C1, and are members of a gene family including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) and CCAAT-binding factor subunit A (CBF-A) genes. Bacterially expressed AlF-C1 can bind sequence-specifically to the AldB gene promoter, whereas AlF-C2 can only weakly. Transfection experiments using mammalian expression vectors showed that AlF-C1 down-regulates the AldB gene promoter in rat hepatoma cells, while AlF-C2 had no or little effect. Expressions of mRNAs encoding these two proteins are enriched in fetal livers and in regenerating livers. These results implied that AlF-C1 and/or C2 is involved in growth-regulated repression of the AldB gene.</text></passage></document><document><id>338</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evaluation of linkage and association of HPC2/ELAC2 in patients with familial or sporadic prostate cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>To investigate the relationship between HPC2/ELAC2 and prostate cancer risk, we performed the following analyses: (1) a linkage study of six markers in and around the HPC2/ELAC2 gene at 17p11 in 159 pedigrees with hereditary prostate cancer (HPC); (2) a mutation-screening analysis of all coding exons of the gene in 93 probands with HPC; (3) family-based and population-based association study of common HPC2/ELAC2 missense variants in 159 probands with HPC, 249 patients with sporadic prostate cancer, and 222 unaffected male control subjects. No evidence for linkage was found in the total sample, nor in any subset of pedigrees based on characteristics that included age at onset, number of affected members, male-to-male disease transmission, or race. Furthermore, only the two previously reported missense changes (Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr) were identified by mutational analysis of all HPC2/ELAC exons in 93 probands with HPC. In association analyses, family-based tests did not reveal excess transmission of the Leu217 and/or Thr541 alleles to affected offspring, and population-based tests failed to reveal any statistically significant difference in the allele frequencies of the two polymorphisms between patients with prostate cancer and control subjects. The results of this study lead us to reject the three alternative hypotheses of (1) a highly penetrant, major prostate cancer-susceptibility gene at 17p11, (2) the allelic variants Leu217 or Thr541 of HPC2/ELAC2 as high-penetrance mutations, and (3) the variants Leu217 or Thr541 as low-penetrance, risk-modifying alleles. However, we did observe a trend of higher Leu217 homozygous carrier rates in patients than in control subjects. Considering the impact of genetic heterogeneity, phenocopies, and incomplete penetrance on the linkage and association studies of prostate cancer and on the power to detect linkage and association in our study sample, our results cannot rule out the possibility of a highly penetrant prostate cancer gene at this locus that only segregates in a small number of pedigrees. Nor can we rule out a prostate cancer-modifier gene that confers a lower-than-reported risk. Additional larger studies are needed to more fully evaluate the role of this gene in prostate cancer risk.</text></passage></document><document><id>339</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Serotonin transporter polymorphism and response to SSRIs in major depression and relevance to anxiety disorders and substance abuse.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>133</offset><text>The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which modulate serotonergic activity are effective in the treatment of serotonin-related mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety.

The other de novo mutation was observed at c.514G>C, codon 51 in proband ODC 5-1 with optic disc coloboma. Both G>C base substitutions cause a relatively conservative amino acid change, altering glycine to alanine residues within the paired DNA-binding domain. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have been able to identify two sequence variations in the PAX6 gene. These missense mutations may uniquely alter the structure and expression of PAX6 protein, resulting in distinct clinical phenotypes. Mutation analysis of 27 probands for PAX6 has resulted in only two significant variants. This finding demonstrated that the frequency of PAX6 mutations associated with optic nerve malformation is low, requiring the elucidation of other candidate genes in other patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>341</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular and clinical characterization of a patient with a chromosome 4p deletion, Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, and congenital glaucoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>135</offset><text>Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is a developmental disorder associated with hemizygous deletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 4. We have identified a patient affected with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome and early onset glaucoma. Five other patients with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome and early onset glaucoma or ocular anomalies associated with early onset glaucoma have been previously described, suggesting that the association with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is not coincidental. The infrequent association of early onset glaucoma suggests that the chromosomal region commonly deleted in Wolf-Hirschhorn patients does not contain genes responsible for early onset glaucoma. In this study, we performed a molecular characterization of the deleted chromosome 4 to determine the extent of the deletion in an attempt to begin to identify the chromosomal region responsible for the associated glaucoma. Using microsatellite repeat markers located on 4p, we determined that the deletion spanned a 60-cM region including the minimal Wolf-Hirschhorn region. The proximal breakpoint occurred between markers D4S3045 and D4S2974. These results support the hypothesis that patients with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome and early onset glaucoma may have large deletions of 4p that include a gene(s) that may be responsible for a dominant form of congenital glaucoma.</text></passage></document><document><id>342</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome(ALPS)].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>49</offset></passage></document><document><id>343</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mouse tissue culture models of unstable triplet repeats: in vitro selection for larger alleles, mutational expansion bias and tissue specificity, but no association with cell division rates.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>191</offset><text>The expansion of CAG.CTG trinucleotide repeats has been associated with an increasing number of human diseases. Once into the expanded disease-associated range, the repeats become dramatically unstable in the germline and also throughout the soma. Instability is expansion-biased, contributing towards the unusual genetics, and most likely the tissue-specificity and progressive nature of the symptoms. Such expansions constitute a unique form of dynamic mutation whose mechanism is poorly understood. It is generally assumed that repeat length changes arise via replication slippage, yet no direct evidence exists to support this hypothesis in a mammalian system. We have previously generated transgenic mouse models of unstable CAG.CTG repeats that reconstitute the dynamic nature of somatic mosaicism observed in humans. We have now used tissues from these mice to establish in vitro cell cultures. Monitoring of repeat stability in these cells has revealed the progressive accumulation of larger alleles as a result of repeat length changes in vitro, as confirmed by single cell cloning. We also observed the selection of cells carrying longer repeats during the first few passages of the cultures and frequent additional selective sweeps at later stages. The highest levels of instability were observed in cultured kidney cells, whereas the transgene remained relatively stable in eye cells and very stable in lung cells, paralleling the previous in vivo observations. No correlation between repeat instability and the cell proliferation rate was found, rejecting a simple association between length change mutations and cell division, and confirming a role for additional cell-type specific factors.</text></passage></document><document><id>344</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>"Mitotic drive" of expanded CTG repeats in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), an expanded CTG repeat shows repeat size instability in somatic and germ line tissues with a strong bias toward further expansion. To investigate the mechanism of this expansion bias, 29 DM1 and six normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (LBCLs) were single-cell cloned from blood cells of 18 DM1 patients and six normal subjects. In all 29 cell lines, the expanded CTG repeat alleles gradually shifted toward further expansion by "step-wise" mutations. Of these 29 cell lines, eight yielded a rapidly proliferating mutant with a gain of large repeat size that became the major allele population, eventually replacing the progenitor allele population. By mixing cell lines with different repeat expansions, we found that cells with larger CTG repeat expansion had a growth advantage over those with smaller expansions in culture. This growth advantage was attributable to increased cell proliferation mediated by Erk1,2 activation, which is negatively regulated by p21(WAF1). This phenomenon, which we designated "mitotic drive" , is a novel mechanism which can explain the expansion bias of DM1 CTG repeat instability at the tissue level, on a basis independent of the DNA-based expansion models. The lifespans of the DM1 LBCLs were significantly shorter than normal cell lines. Thus, we propose a hypothesis that DM1 LBCLs drive themselves to extinction through a process related to increased proliferation.</text></passage></document><document><id>345</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genomic structure and chromosomal mapping of the gene coding for ICBP90, a protein involved in the regulation of the topoisomerase IIalpha gene expression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>156</offset><text>We have recently identified a novel CCAAT box binding protein (ICBP90) involved in the regulation of topoisomerase IIalpha gene expression. We have observed that it is expressed in non-tumoral proliferating human lung fibroblast cells whereas in HeLa cells, a tumoral cell line, ICBP90 was still present even when cells were at confluence. In the present study, we have determined the ICBP90 gene structure by screening of a human placenta genomic library and PCR analysis. We report that the ICBP90 gene spans about 35.8 kb and contains six coding exons named A to F. In the 5' upstream sequence of the region containing the coding exons, two additional exons (I and II) were found. Additionally, an internal splicing site was found in exon A. A promoter region, including three putative Sp1 binding sites between exons I and A, was identified by transient transfection. Northern blot analysis of several cancer cell lines revealed the existence of two ICBP90 mRNA species of 5.1 and 4.3 kb that are transcribed from the gene. The relative amounts of these mRNAs depended on the cell type. In MOLT-4 cells and Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells, the 4.3 kb or the 5.1 kb transcripts were mainly observed, respectively. In other cell lines, such as HL-60 cells, chronic myelogenous leukaemia K-562, lung carcinoma A549, HeLa or colorectal SW480, both 4.3 and 5.1 kb forms of ICBP90 mRNA could be detected. Interestingly, western blot analysis showed several ICBP90 protein bands in HeLa but only a single band in MOLT-4 cell extracts. Taken together our results are consistent with the ICBP90 gene exhibiting alternative splicing and promoter usage in a cell-specific manner.</text></passage></document><document><id>346</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Analysis of a case of balanced chromosome translocation and phenotypic abnormality by fluorescence in situ hybridization].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To delineate the chromosome structural aberration in a case of chromosome translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) technique and precisely identify the breakpoints.

The disease is known to be associated with extensive clinical variability, and mutation studies indicate that genotypes are also highly variant among WAS patients. In this study, we performed mutation analysis of the WASP gene in 14 unrelated Spanish families by single strand conformation analysis (SSCA) and sequencing, resulting in the identification of a novel mutation and nine known mutations. No mutation was identified in one family. The ten different mutations include point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions, stop codons, and small deletions and insertions causing frameshifts. Missense mutations were preferentially located in the amino-terminal part of the protein, exons 2 and 4, whereas stop and frameshift mutations were located in the carboxyl-terminal region, exons 10 and 11. However, in two families, two missense mutations in exon 11 were identified. Our study demonstrates that WASP genotypes have some concordance with the patients' phenotypes, although mutation 1019delC, identified in a family with several affected members, resulted in high intrafamilial clinical variability.</text></passage></document><document><id>348</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast-ovarian families from a breast cancer risk evaluation clinic.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset><text>PURPOSE: Data from the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium suggest that the proportion of familial breast and ovarian cancers linked to BRCA1 or BRCA2 may be as high as 98% depending on the characteristics of the families, suggesting that mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 may entirely account for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families. We sought to determine what proportion of families with both breast and ovarian cancers seen in a breast cancer risk evaluation clinic are accounted for by coding region germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 as compared to a linkage study group. We also evaluated what clinical parameters were predictive of mutation status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Affected women from 100 families with at least one case of breast cancer and at least one case of ovarian cancer in the same lineage were screened for germline mutations in the entire coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis, a polymerase chain reaction-based heteroduplex analysis, or direct sequencing. RESULTS: Unequivocal deleterious mutations were found in 55% (55 of 100) of the families studied. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 accounted for 80% and 20% of the mutations overall, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of detecting a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in this study group were the presence of a single family member with both breast and ovarian cancer (P &lt;.0009; odds ratio [OR], 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04 to 15.76) and a young average age at breast cancer diagnosis in the family (P &lt;.0016; OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.38). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that at least half of breast/ovarian families evaluated in a high-risk cancer evaluation clinic may have germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Whether the remaining families have mutations in noncoding regions in BRCA1, mutations in other, as-yet-unidentified, low-penetrance susceptibility genes, or represent chance clustering remains to be determined.</text></passage></document><document><id>349</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>T2 relaxometry of brain in myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>47</offset><text>We investigated the nature and extent of brain involvement in myotonic dystrophy (DM), examining possible T2 relaxation abnormalities in the brain of 20 patients with adult-onset DM and 20 sex- and age-matched normal controls.

Linkage studies have shown that a locus for this disease lies in a 1.4-cM region at chromosome 3q28-->q29 and have suggested a founder haplotype for as many as 95% of the linked families. To aid the identification of candidate genes for this disease, we have constructed a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) contig covering approximately 3.3 Mb and encompassing the OPA1 critical region (flanking markers D3S3669 and D3S3562). This physical map corrects errors in the marker order reported in the literature, allowing the OPA1 critical region to be precisely defined. A reassessment of the founder effect in the light of the revised marker order suggests that it may not be as significant as had previously been suggested. A high-density transcript map was created by precisely mapping genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from GeneMap'99, that have been loosely assigned to the region by radiation hybrid mapping. One known gene (KIAA0567 protein) and 15 ESTs were found to lie within the minimal disease region. Analysis of the sequence data already available from within the OPA1 critical region allowed the identification and mapping of a further 31 ESTs. The work presented in this study provides the basis for the characterisation of candidate genes and the ultimate identification of the gene mutated in DOA.</text></passage></document><document><id>352</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>New mutations inactivating transferrin receptor 2 in hemochromatosis type 3.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>Hereditary hemochromatosis usually results from C282Y homozygosity in the HFE gene on chromosome 6p. Recently, a new type of hemochromatosis (HFE3) has been characterized in 2 unrelated Italian families with a disorder linked to 7q. Patients with HFE3 have transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) inactivated by a homozygous nonsense mutation (Y250X). Here the identification of 2 new TFR2 mutations is reported. In a large inbred family from Campania, a frameshift mutation (84-88 insC) in exon 2 that causes a premature stop codon (E60X) is identified. In a single patient with nonfamilial hemochromatosis, a T-->A transversion (T515A), which causes a Methionine-->Lysine substitution at position 172 of the protein (M172K), has been characterized. TFR2 gene gives origin to 2 alternatively spliced transcripts-the alpha-transcript, which may encode a transmembrane protein, and the beta-transcript, a shorter, possibly intracellular variant. Based on their positions, the effects of the identified mutations on the 2 TFR2 forms are expected to differ. Y250X inactivates both transcripts, whereas E60X inactivates only the alpha-form. M172K has a complex effect: it causes a missense in the alpha-form, but it may also prevent the beta-form production because it affects its putative initiation codon. Analysis of the clinical phenotype of 13 HFE3 homozygotes characterized at the molecular level has shown a variable severity, from nonexpressing patients to severe clinical complications. The identification of new mutations of TFR2 confirms that this gene is associated with iron overload and offers a tool for molecular diagnosis in patients without HFE mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>353</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Duodenal expression of a putative stimulator of Fe transport and transferrin receptor in anemia and hemochromatosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>BACKGROUND _ AIMS: Stimulator of Fe Transport (SFT) and transferrin receptor (TfR) are proteins involved in iron transport. This study evaluated iron metabolism protein expression in duodenal biopsy specimens from controls and patients with abnormal iron metabolism. METHODS: Twelve controls, 8 patients with iron deficiency anemia, 7 with HFE-related hemochromatosis, and 6 with non-HFE-related iron overload were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed on duodenal biopsy specimens with anti-TfR and anti-SFT antibodies which recognize a putative stimulator of Fe transport of ~80 kilodaltons. RESULTS: In controls, the putative stimulator of Fe transport was expressed in the middle and distal part of the villi in the subapical cytoplasmatic region. Its expression increased in anemics and, to a lesser degree, in HFE-related hemochromatotics, whereas it was reduced in patients with non-HFE-related iron overload. TfR expression showed a crypt-to-tip gradient in controls, but not in anemics, in whom it was uniformly overexpressed. TfR expression was intermediate in HFE-related hemochromatotics and similar to controls in non-HFE-related iron overload. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the putative stimulator of Fe transport and TfR increases in iron deficiency. Increased expression of both proteins is present only in HFE-related hemochromatotics suggesting that other factors may be involved in determining non-HFE-related iron overload phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>354</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Knock-in mice with a chimeric human/murine p53 gene develop normally and show wild-type p53 responses to DNA damaging agents: a new biomedical research tool.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>158</offset><text>The high prevalence and great diversity of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations in human tumors call for development of therapeutic molecules that rescue function of aberrant p53 protein. P53 mutations also offer new approaches to the study of the origins of mutations in human cancer. An experimental mouse model with a genetically modified but normal functioning p53 gene harboring the human rather than the murine core domain, would be of considerable benefit to research on both cancer therapeutics and etiology; however, it is uncertain whether such mice would permit biological functions of p53 to be retained. Using a Cre/lox P gene-targeting approach, we have constructed a human p53 knock-in (hupki) mouse strain in which exons 4-9 of the endogenous mouse p53 allele were replaced with the homologous, normal human p53 gene sequence. The chimeric p53 allele (p53(KI)) is properly spliced, transcribed in various tissues at levels equivalent to wild-type mice, and yields cDNA with the anticipated sequence, that is, with a core domain matching that of humans. The hupki p53 protein binds to p53 consensus sequences in gel mobility shift assays and accumulates in the nucleus of hupki fibroblasts in response to UV irradiation, as is characteristic of wild-type p53. Induction of various p53-regulated genes in spleen of gamma-irradiated homozygous hupki mice (p53(KI/KI)), and the kinetics of p53-dependent apoptosis in thymocytes are similar to results with wild-type (p53(+/+)) mice, further indicating normal p53 pathway function in the hupki strain. The mice are phenotypically normal and do not develop spontaneous tumors at an early age, in contrast to knock-out (p53(-/-)) strains with a defective p53 gene. The chimeric (p53(KI)) allele thus appears to provide a biological equivalent to the endogenous murine (p53(+)) gene. This strain is a unique tool for examining in vivo spontaneous and induced mutations in human p53 gene sequences for comparison with published human tumor p53 mutation spectra. In addition, the hupki strain paves the way for mouse models in pre-clinical testing of pharmaceuticals designed to modulate DNA-binding activity of human p53.</text></passage></document><document><id>355</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Autosomal dominant primary hyperparathyroidism and jaw tumor syndrome associated with renal hamartomas and cystic kidney disease: linkage to 1q21-q32 and loss of the wild type allele in renal hamartomas. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>204</offset><text>Hereditary hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome ( HPT-JT ) is an autosomal dominant disease ( OMIM 145001 ) that has recently been mapped to chromosomal region 1q21-q32 ( HRPT2 ) .

However, these findings were observed in predominantly non-Jewish populations; in the three studies where Ashkenazi Jews were included for analysis, the results have been widely divergent. Because Ashkenazi Jews are known to have a higher incidence of the disease than non-Jews, we sought to determine whether this previously reported linkage could be extended to the Ashkenazi population. In addition, we examined whether Ashkenazi Jewish patients with an early age of onset (&lt; or = 21 yr) showed greater evidence of linkage to this locus. METHODS: Linkage analysis for the IBD1 region was performed on 123 Ashkenazi Jewish CD patients distributed among 53 families. Only patients with four Jewish grandparents were considered to be Jewish. Of the 123 Ashkenazi Jewish patients, 75 (61%) had an age of onset &lt; or = 21 yr. RESULTS: Ashkenazi Jews showed only modest evidence of linkage (nonparametric linkage 1.63, p = 0.05) to the IBD1 locus. However, when the Ashkenazi population was subdivided on the basis of age of onset, there was a striking increase in linkage in families where affected individuals had an age of onset &lt; or = 21 yr (nonparametric linkage 3.02, p = 0.002). In contrast, there was no evidence of linkage in the Jewish families where all affected individuals had an age of onset > 21 yr. CONCLUSIONS: The IBD1 gene plays a greater role in conferring susceptibility to CD in Jews with early onset disease than in Jews with late onset disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>357</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Defective apoptosis in lymphocytes and the role of IL-2 in autoimmune hematologic cytopenias.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Fas-mediated signaling is important for lymphocyte elimination.

FasL function, though variable, was not significantly different from that of simultaneously evaluated controls. Only 1 patient had a Fas mutation and manifestations of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. In contrast, lymphocytes from his clinically normal mother with the same mutation were normally sensitive to FasL. In 3 patients, normal Fas-mediated lysis was restored with rhIL-2. IL-2 had no effect in the other 2 patients. Activation and proliferation functions of IL-2 were normal in all 5. We conclude that altered Fas signaling, independent of Fas mutations, can precipitate hematologic autoimmunity. IL-2 can rescue some lymphocytes from this defect. In IL-2 refractory cases, a persistently defective response to IL-2 continues to confer a lymphocyte survival advantage. Hence, altered Fas pathway signaling with or without defective IL-2 responses should be considered in the etiology of hematologic autoimmunity.</text></passage></document><document><id>358</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Human ameloblastin gene: genomic organization and mutation analysis in amelogenesis imperfecta patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>A gene encoding the enamel protein ameloblastin (AMBN) was recently localized to a region on chromosome 4q21 containing a gene for the inherited enamel defect local hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta (AIH2). Ameloblastin protein is located at the Tomes processes of secretory ameloblasts and in the sheath space between rod-interrod enamel, and the AMBN gene therefore represents a viable candidate gene for local hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). In this study, the genomic organization of human AMBN was characterized. The gene was shown to consist of 13 exons and 12 introns. An alternatively spliced 45 bp sequence was shown not to represent a separate exon and is most likely spliced by the use of a cryptic splice site. The finding that there were no recombinations between an intragenic microsatellite and AIH2 encouraged us to evaluate this gene's potential role as a candidate gene for local hypoplastic AI. Mutation screening was performed on all 13 exons in 20 families and 8 sporadic cases with 6 different forms of AI. DNA variants were found but none that was associated exclusively with local hypoplastic AI or any of the other variants of AI in the identified Swedish families.

In the present study nine different RFLPs (TaqI, StuI, HincII, BstEII, AvaII, PvuII, MspIA, MspIB, and NcoI) and a sequence variation at Arg450 were used to clarify the characteristics of the LDL-receptor gene in Koreans. A total of 978 LDL-receptor alleles from 244 members of 43 different pedigrees (15 normal and 28 FH pedigrees) and 245 individuals (187 normal and 58 FH) were analyzed. Frequencies of these polymorphisms did not differ significantly between controls and FH patients. Individually, seven sites--TaqI, BstEII, AvaII, MspIA, MspIB, NcoI and Arg450--had heterozygosity indices ranging from 0.3610 to 0.4601, whereas the PvuII site displayed low levels of polymorphism and StuI was monomorphic.

The frequency distribution of individual haplotypes ranged from 1/155 (0.65%) to 40/155 (25.8%). The four most common haplotypes accounted for 59.4% of those sampled. Statistical analysis of the haplotypes indicated marked linkage disequilibrium for these 10 sites and throughout the region containing the LDL-receptor gene. Owing to the high degree of linkage disequilibrium over the entire locus, not all RFLPs were informative. We rank each RFLP according to its informativeness and present a strategy for the optimal selection of RFLPs for pedigree analysis.</text></passage></document><document><id>360</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Phenotypic variability of Cat-Eye syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset><text>Cat-Eye syndrome (CES) is a disorder with a variable pattern of multiple congenital anomalies of which coloboma of the iris and anal atresia are the best known. CES is cytogenetically characterised by the presence of an extra bisatellited marker chromosome, which represents an inverted dicentric duplication of a part of chromosome 22 (inv dup(22)). We report on three CES-patients who carry an inv dup(22) diagnosed with FISH studies. They show remarkable phenotypic variability. The cause of this variability is unknown. Furthermore, we review clinical features of 71 reported patients. Only 41% of the CES-patients have the combination of iris coloboma, anal anomalies and pre-auricular anomalies. Therefore, almost 60% of the CES-patients are hard to recognize by their phenotype alone. Mild to moderate mental retardation was found in 32% (16/50) of the cases. Mental retardation occurs more frequently in male CES-patients. There is no apparent phenotypic difference between mentally retarded and mentally normal CES-patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>361</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>I heartily praise the first issue of Genetics in Medicine for its immediate applicability to clinical genetic practice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>120</offset></passage></document><document><id>362</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Hypo- and hyperalphalipoproteinemia and genetic abnormalties in reverse cholesterol transport system].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset></passage></document><document><id>363</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The human aminophospholipid-transporting ATPase gene ATP10C maps adjacent to UBE3A and exhibits similar imprinted expression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>Maternal duplications of the imprinted 15q11-13 domain result in an estimated 1%-2% of autism-spectrum disorders, and linkage to autism has been identified within 15q12-13.

Here we describe the characterization of ATP10C, a new human imprinted gene, which encodes a putative protein homologous to the mouse aminophospholipid-transporting ATPase Atp10c. ATP10C maps within 200 kb distal to UBE3A and, like UBE3A, also demonstrates imprinted, preferential maternal expression in human brain. The location and imprinted expression of ATP10C thus make it a candidate for chromosome 15-associated autism and suggest that it may contribute to the Angelman syndrome phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>364</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Widespread expression of netrin-1 by neurons and oligodendrocytes in the adult mammalian spinal cord.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>102</offset><text>Netrins are a family of secreted proteins that function as chemotropic axon guidance cues during neural development. Here we demonstrate that netrin-1 continues to be expressed in the adult rat spinal cord at a level similar to that in the embryonic CNS. In contrast, netrin-3, which is also expressed in the embryonic spinal cord, was not detected in the adult. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that cells in the white matter and the gray matter of the adult spinal cord express netrin-1. Colocalization studies using the neuronal marker NeuN revealed that netrin-1 is expressed by multiple classes of spinal interneurons and motoneurons. Markers identifying glial cell types indicated that netrin-1 is expressed by most, if not all, oligodendrocytes but not by astrocytes. During neural development, netrin-1 has been proposed to function as a diffusible long-range cue for growing axons. We show that in the adult spinal cord the majority of netrin-1 protein is not freely soluble but is associated with membranes or the extracellular matrix. Fractionation of adult spinal cord white matter demonstrated that netrin-1 was absent from fractions enriched for compact myelin but was enriched in fractions containing periaxonal myelin and axolemma, indicating that netrin-1 protein may be localized to the periaxonal space. These findings suggest that in addition to its role as a long-range guidance cue for developing axons, netrin may have a short-range function associated with the cell surface that contributes to the maintenance of appropriate neuronal and axon-oligodendroglial interactions in the mature nervous system.</text></passage></document><document><id>365</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is the result of expansion of glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-anchored protein-deficient clone in the condition of deficient hematopoiesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>184</offset><text>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired, clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which PIG-A, gene essential for the biosynthesis of the glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor, is somatically mutated. Absence of GPI-linked proteins from the surface of blood cells is characteristic of the PIG-A mutant (PNH) clone and is also accountable fo certain manifestations, such as intravascular hemolysis. It is unclear how the PNH clone expands and comes to dominate hematopoiesis. In this study, CD34+ cells--committed progenitors (colony-forming cells) representing immature hematopoietic stem cells--and reticulocytes representing the differentiated erythroid cells were quantitated in peripheral blood of patients with PNH. Compared with normal controls (n = 29), CD34+ cell levels were significantly lower in PNH patients who did not have preexisting aplastic anemia (AA) (n = 12) (2.47+/-1.23 versus 4.68+/-1.05 x 106/L, mean +/- standard error; P = .022). PNH patients with precedent aplastic anemia (AA+/PNH) showed markedly low CD34+ cell levels compared with normal control subjects (0.6+/-0.29 versus 4.68+/-1.05 x 10(6)/L; P = .0001). In addition, colony-forming cells from PNH patients were significantly decreased compared with those from normal volunteers (erythroid burst-forming units, 2.8+/-1.2 versu 25.6+/-6.2/5 x 10(5) mononuclear cells; P = .0006; and granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units, 1.2+/-0.5 versus 13.3+/-3.0/ 5 x 10(5) mononuclear cells; P = .0006). These findings occur in both aplastic and hemolytic types of PNH, suggesting hematopoietic failure in PNH. On the contrary, the numbers of reticulocytes and the reticulocyte production index of PNH patients were significantly higher than those of normal persons and comparable to those from patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, indicating accelerating erythropoiesis in PNH. The degree of reticulocytosis correlated well with the proportion of CD59- (PNH) reticulocytes. All of the findings suggest that in the condition of deficient hematopoiesis, the PNH clone arising from the mutated hematopoietic stem cell expands and maintains a substantial proportion of the patient's hematopoiesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>366</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Segregation distortion in myotonic dystrophy. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>46</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disease which , in the typical pedigree , shows a three generation anticipation cascade .

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Neurologic intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Serial SEP recordings were obtained from 31 consecutive patients with closed head injury. The first SEP was recorded within 48 hrs after trauma, followed by recordings after another 2 days, after which the time interval for each consecutive recording was doubled. Clinical examinations were performed every 6 hrs during the ICU stay and daily after transfer to a general neurologic ward. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three of 31 patients demonstrated pathologic SEP findings at initial examination. Of these patients, 11 recovered clinically, two remained vegetative, and ten died. In all 11 patients with clinical recovery, SEP also recovered. In 8 of 31 patients, initial SEPs were normal and remained normal until discharge, all eight had a good outcome. Initial SEP findings were related with outcome at 6 months (p = .02), and follow-up studies increased the predictive value of SEP studies (p = .009). Other factors related to outcome included age, severity of DAI, and length of ICU/hospital stay. In the 11 patients with SEP and clinical recovery, early (day 2) and late (>or=2 months) recovery was documented. Early and reliable SEP indicators of improvement included N20-P25-Amplitudes (mean recovery, 8.5 days) and central conduction time (9.6 days). Pupillary light reaction (6.4 days), Babinski reflex (12.4 days), and Glasgow Coma Score (9.6 days) were the most valuable clinical findings. Recovery of the Glasgow Coma Score frequently coincided with reduction of sedatives. In most patients, recovery was detected with SEP before clinical recovery (7/11 patients, time difference 1 wk). CONCLUSIONS: Initial SEP findings correlate with long-term outcome in patients with closed head injury with DAI. Initial bilaterally absent cortical responses in the SEP reliably predicted death, whereas completely normal SEP findings predicted good long-term outcome. Early recovery after DAI can be detected with serial SEP recordings despite sedative medications. Electrophysiologic recovery frequently precedes clinical recovery.</text></passage></document><document><id>368</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prothrombotic inherited abnormalities other than factor V Leiden mutation do not play a role in venous thrombosis in inflammatory bowel disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>145</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: Because the incidence of thromboembolism is increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we attempted to assess the role of prothrombotic inherited coagulation abnormalities in the development of thrombosis. METHODS: Four populations were compared: 15 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and a previous venous thrombosis, 58 control patients with inflammatory bowel disease but without thrombosis, 110 patients without inflammatory bowel disease but with previous deep venous thrombosis, and 84 healthy subjects. Inherited and acquired risk factors of venous thrombosis, e.g., factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210A mutations, C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism, a polymorphism located in exon 13 of factor V gene, inflammatory and hypercoagulability markers were studied in each population. RESULTS: In the study, 14.3% of thrombotic patients with inflammatory bowel disease had factor V Leiden mutation versus 0% of control patients with inflammatory bowel disease (p = 0.04), 15.5% of thrombotic patients without inflammatory bowel disease (NS) and 3.6% of the healthy controls. A total of 14% of thrombotic patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 11.8% of thrombotic patients without inflammatory bowel disease carried prothrombin 20210A mutation, compared to 1.7% of control patients with inflammatory bowel disease; however, the difference was just below significance. Other inherited coagulation abnormalities were not statistically significantly different among the four populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that factor V Leiden mutation increases the risk for thrombotic events but is not more frequent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Our results do not support the role of other thrombotic risk factors.</text></passage></document><document><id>369</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A loss-of-function mutation of c-kit results in depletion of mast cells and interstitial cells of Cajal, while its gain-of-function mutation results in their oncogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>171</offset><text>Loss-of-function mutations of the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) result in depletion of mast cells and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs).

The former were found in the juxtamembrane domain between the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains, and the latter in the tyrosine kinase domain. Moreover, the mechanism of constitutive activation is different. Point mutations and/or deletions in the juxtamembrane domain induced the KIT dimerization, and the dimerized KIT was activated. A point mutation at the particular aspartic acid in the tyrosine kinase domain induced spontaneous activation without forming dimers. Mutations of the c-kit gene are a good model for understanding the relationship between mutations and diseases in both humans and mice.</text></passage></document><document><id>370</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Multiple origins of the mtDNA 7472insC mutation associated with hearing loss and neurological dysfunction.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Several mtDNA mutations have been reported in families with both syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss.

Immunization of SWXJ mice with the immunodominant p139-151 peptide of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) results in a relapsing-remitting pattern of EAE characterized by incomplete remyelination during clinical recovery. In the present study we observed two distinct clinical patterns of spontaneous remission during recovery from EAE, viz., sustained remission involving continuous neurologic improvement and aborted remission involving modest transient clinical improvement. We hypothesized that the ability to recover from autoimmune demyelination was directly linked to remyelination events that recapitulated developmental processes. Quantitative immunocytochemistry of CNS tissue showed decreased demyelination in mice undergoing sustained remission compared to mice undergoing aborted remission. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed elevated expression of DM20, the developmental isoform of PLP, in CNS tissue from mice undergoing sustained remission compared to mice undergoing aborted recovery. Moreover, DM20 expression was similarly elevated in CNS tissue from mice undergoing sustained recovery from EAE relapse. Our data indicate that expression of the developmental DM20 isoform of PLP is intimately associated with decreased demyelination and sustained clinical recovery from EAE. Thus, DM20 gene expression may provide an appropriate molecular target for promoting CNS remyelination and may serve as a useful marker for predicting clinical outcome and assessing the effectiveness of strategies aimed at promoting CNS tissue repair during autoimmune demyelinating disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>373</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PTEN and myotubularin: novel phosphoinositide phosphatases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are a diverse group of enzymes that contain a highly conserved active site motif, Cys-x5-Arg (Cx5R). The PTP superfamily enzymes, which include tyrosine-specific, dual specificity, low-molecular-weight, and Cdc25 phosphatases, are key mediators of a wide variety of cellular processes, including growth, metabolism, differentiation, motility, and programmed cell death. The PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 gene was originally identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene located on human chromosome 10q23; it encodes a protein with sequence similarity to PTPs and tensin. Recent studies have demonstrated that PTEN plays an essential role in regulating signaling pathways involved in cell growth and apoptosis, and mutations in the PTEN gene are now known to cause tumorigenesis in a number of human tissues. In addition, germ line mutations in the PTEN gene also play a major role in the development of Cowden and Bannayan-Zonana syndromes, in which patients often suffer from increased risk of breast and thyroid cancers. Biochemical studies of the PTEN phosphatase have revealed a molecular mechanism by which tumorigenesis may be caused in individuals with PTEN mutations. Unlike most members of the PTP superfamily, PTEN utilizes the phosphoinositide second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), as its physiologic substrate. This inositol lipid is an important regulator of cell growth and survival signaling through the Ser/Thr protein kinases PDK1 and Akt. By specifically dephosphorylating the D3 position of PIP3, the PTEN tumor suppressor functions as a negative regulator of signaling processes downstream of this lipid second messenger. Mutations that impair PTEN function result in a marked increase in cellular levels of PIP3 and constitutive activation of Akt survival signaling pathways, leading to inhibition of apoptosis, hyperplasia, and tumor formation. Certain structural features of PTEN contribute to its specificity for PIP3, as well as its role(s) in regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Recently, myotubularin, a second PTP superfamily enzyme associated with human disease, has also been shown to utilize a phosphoinositide as its physiologic substrate.</text></passage></document><document><id>374</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>GAA repeat polymorphism in Turkish Friedreich's ataxia patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common subtype of early onset hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by unstable GAA tri-nucleotide expansions in the first intron of FRDA gene located at 9q13-q21.1 position.

Twenty six patients were homozygous for GAA expansion and size of expanded alleles differed from approximately 425 to 1300 repeats. Children 2 and 6 years old (showing no ataxia symptoms) of one family had homozygous GAA expansions reaching approximately 925 repeats. All 11 families studied had at least 1 afflicted child and 9 parents and 2 siblings were carrier (heterozygous) with mutant alleles ranging from 66 to 850 repeats.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum samples from a cohort of 252 patients with hematologic or oncologic diseases who are receiving cellular blood components were studied for platelet-reactive antibodies. Specificity of platelet alloantibodies was determined with a panel of typed platelets RESULTS: Platelet-reactive antibodies were detected in the sera of 113 patients (44.8% of 252), HLA antibodies in the sera of 108 (42.9%), and platelet-specific antibodies in the sera of 20 (8%). The following platelet-specific antibodies were identified: anti-HPA-5b (n = 10), anti-HPA-1b (n = 4), anti-HPA-5a (n = 2), anti-HPA-1a (n = 1), anti-HPA-2b (n = 1), anti-HPA-1b+5b (n = 1), and anti-HPA-1b+2b (n = 1). Fifteen sera from the 108 patients with anti-HLA (13.9%) contained additional platelet-specific alloantibodies, while in 5 sera, platelet-specific alloantibodies only were detected: anti-HPA-5b (n = 4) and anti-HPA-1a (n = 1). Of the 108 sera with HLA antibodies, 29 (26.9%) showed discordant results when studied with the lymphocytotoxicity test and the glycoprotein-specific immunoassay. Ten sera contained panreactive antibodies against platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIb/IIIa, GPIa/IIa, and/or GPIb/IX. Alloimmunization occurred in 58.3 percent of female patients with previous pregnancies, but in only 23.3 percent of those without previous pregnancies (p = 0.0049). CONCLUSION: Platelet alloantibody specificities in transfused patients (predominantly anti-HPA-5b and -1b with antigen frequencies &lt;30% among whites) differ significantly from those observed in patients with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia or posttransfusion purpura, in whom anti-HPA-1a (antigen frequency >95%) is the most prevalent specificity.

Approximately 10% of AT homozygotes develop cancer, mostly of the lymphoid system. Lymphoid malignancies in patients with AT are of both B cell and T cell origin, and include Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and several forms of leukaemia. The AT locus was mapped to the chromosomal region 11q22-23 using genetic linkage analysis in the late 1980s and the causative gene was identified by positional cloning several years later. The ATM gene encodes a large protein that belongs to a family of kinases possessing a highly conserved C-terminal kinase domain related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain. Members of this kinase family have been shown to function in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control following DNA damage. Recent studies indicate that ATM is activated primarily in response to double strand breaks and may be considered a caretaker of the genome. Most mutations in ATM result in truncation and destabilisation of the protein, but certain missense and splicing errors have been shown to produce a less severe phenotype. AT heterozygotes have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. Atm deficient mice exhibit many of the symptoms found in patients with AT and have a high frequency of thymic lymphoma. The association between mutation of the ATM gene and a high incidence of lymphoid malignancy in patients with AT, together with the development of lymphoma in Atm deficient mice, supports the proposal that inactivation of the ATM gene may be of importance in the pathogenesis of sporadic lymphoid malignancy. Loss of heterozygosity at 11q22-23 (the location of the ATM gene) is a common event in lymphoid malignancy. Frequent inactivating mutations of the ATM gene have been reported in patients with rare sporadic T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), and most recently, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in AT, the most frequent nucleotide changes in these sporadic lymphoid malignancies were missense mutations. The presence of inactivating mutations, together with the deletion of the normal copy of the ATM gene in some patients with T-PLL, B-CLL, and MCL, establishes somatic inactivation of the ATM gene in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies, and strongly suggests that ATM functions as a tumour suppressor. The presence of missense mutations in the germline of patients with B-CLL has been reported, suggesting that some patients with B-CLL may be constitutional AT heterozygotes. The putative hereditary predisposition of B-CLL, although intriguing, warrants further investigation.</text></passage></document><document><id>381</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein as a protective factor against vascular disease in hemodialysis patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) may promote reverse cholesterol transport.

We investigated the independent or synergistic influence of postprandial serum CETP and HDL-C concentrations on apparent atherosclerotic complications in 202 hemodialysis patients aged 40 to 80 years. Patients with vascular disease (n = 39) had significantly lower concentrations of CETP than those without vascular disease (n = 163). When all study subjects were divided into four groups according to CETP and HDL-C concentrations based on median values, we found significant differences in the prevalence of vascular disease (test for trend, P &lt; 0.005): 28.8% in group I (HDL-C &lt; 48 mg/dL; CETP &lt; 2.2 microgram/mL); 25.0% in group II (HDL-C &lt; 48 mg/dL; CETP >/= 2.2 microgram/mL); 17.8% in group III (HDL-C >/= 48 mg/dL; CETP &lt; 2.2 microgram/mL); and 6.9% in group IV (HDL-C >/= 48 mg/dL; CETP >/= 2.2 microgram/mL). Multiple logistic regression analysis retained the interaction term between HDL-C (in milligrams per deciliter) and CETP (in micrograms per milliliter), but not HDL-C or CETP itself, as inversely associated with vascular disease in the entire patient group. In patients with HDL-C levels at the median value or greater, CETP had an independent odds ratio of 0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.97; P &lt; 0.05) after adjusting for age. These results suggest that CETP may serve as a protective factor against vascular disease in hemodialysis patients, especially those with normal or elevated HDL-C concentrations.</text></passage></document><document><id>382</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors/cdk4/cdk2 complexes in early stages of mouse mammary preneoplasia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>The level of circulating ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone) alone or in combination with pituitary hormones have a potent mitogenic impact in the normal mammary gland, and they also play a pivotal role in the development and progression of mammary carcinoma. The differential effects of hormones on the molecular components of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes in mammary epithelium of the hormone-dependent ductal outgrowth line, EL11, and the hormone-independent alveolar outgrowth line, TM2L, were the focus of this study. The two outgrowth lines, which represent early stages in mammary hyperplasia, were compared with normal mammary gland at different hormonal conditions: control, hormone stimulated by pituitary isograft, and hormone depleted by ovariectomy. Hormonal stimulation by a pituitary isograft resulted in DNA synthesis and lobuloalveolar development of normal mammary ducts, DNA synthesis but no lobuloalveolar development in the EL11 ductal outgrowth, and no changes either in DNA synthesis or in lobuloalveolar morphology in the TM2L outgrowth. The levels of cdk4- and cyclin D1-associated kinase activities were correlated with cell proliferation in only the alveolar phenotypes (i.e., in only hormonally stimulated normal virgin gland and in alveolar mammary outgrowth), whereas cyclin D2-dependent kinase activity was correlated with cell proliferation in only the alveolar preneoplasia. p16(INK4a) and p21(Cip1) protein levels were decreased at the earliest stages of preneoplasia, i.e., at immortalization, and were independent from changes in cyclin D1, which occurred later in preneoplasia. Although all cdk inhibitors changed in concordance with hormonal status reflected by proliferation levels, p27(Kip1) was the only cdk inhibitor that was up-regulated at the earliest stages of preneoplasia and may have a unique role in blocking alveolar differentiation in response to the loss of one or more of the cell cycle-negative regulators. We hypothesize that up-regulation of p27(Kip1) prevents immortalized ductal outgrowths (EL11) from progressing to the neoplastic state, even under hormonal stimulation.</text></passage></document><document><id>383</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Large de novo deletion in chromosome 12 affecting the PAH, IGF1, ASCL1, and TRA1 genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>Phenylketonuria is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans, affecting 1 in 10,000 whites. Deletions are generally uncommon in genes in which no long highly homologous segments are present, and in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency they represent only 5% of cases. We present the case of a girl affected by classical phenylketonuria who has been screened for mutations in the PAH gene. During the molecular study a large de novo deletion has detected in 12qter, including PAH, and the genes for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), human achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1), and tumor rejection antigen (TRA1). The patient showed phenylketonuria, short stature, and pathological electro-oculography results in both eyes, with high affectation of the relative electrogenesis of the photoreceptor-pigment epithelium complex. She had previously been misdiagnosed as homozygous for the IVS8nt-7A-G mutation, instead of heterozygous for a mutation and a de novo deletion. As a result incorrect genetic counseling had been given. The deletion of the PAH, IGF1, and ASCL1 genes could explain the patient's phenotype corresponding to a contiguous gene syndrome. We stress the relevance of polymorphic marker haplotype analysis and the importance of family study in genetic recessive diseases, such as phenylketonuria, to avoid incorrect diagnosis and genetic counseling.</text></passage></document><document><id>384</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Linkage and association studies of prostate cancer susceptibility: evidence for linkage at 8p22-23.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Multiple lines of evidence have implicated the short arm of chromosome 8 as harboring genes important in prostate carcinogenesis. Although most of this evidence comes from the identification of frequent somatic alterations of 8p loci in prostate cancer cells (e.g., loss of heterozygosity), studies have also suggested a role for 8p genes in mediation of inherited susceptibility to prostate cancer. To further examine this latter possibility, we performed linkage analyses, in 159 pedigrees affected by hereditary prostate cancer (HPC), using 24 markers on the short arm of chromosome 8. In the complete set of families, evidence for prostate cancer linkage was found at 8p22-23, with a peak HLOD of 1.84 (P=.004), and an estimate of the proportion of families linked (alpha) of 0.14, at D8S1130. In the 79 families with average age at diagnosis >65 years, an allele-sharing LOD score of 2.64 (P=.0005) was observed, and six markers spanning a distance of 10 cM had LOD scores >2.0. Interestingly, the small number of Ashkenazi Jewish pedigrees (n=11) analyzed in this study contributed disproportionately to this linkage. Mutation screening in HPC probands and association analyses in case subjects (a group that includes HPC probands and unrelated case subjects) and unaffected control subjects were carried out for the putative prostate cancer-susceptibility gene, PG1, previously localized to the 8p22-23 region. No statistical differences in the allele, genotype, or haplotype frequencies of the SNPs or other sequence variants in the PG1 gene were observed between case and control subjects. However, case subjects demonstrated a trend toward higher homozygous rates of less-frequent alleles in all three PG1 SNPs, and overtransmission of a PG1 variant to case subjects was observed. In summary, these results provide evidence for the existence of a prostate cancer-susceptibility gene at 8p22-23. Evaluation of the PG1 gene and other candidate genes in this area appears warranted.</text></passage></document><document><id>385</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Natural selection at the MJD locus: phenotypic diversity, survival and fertility among Machado-Joseph Disease patients from the Azores.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of adult onset, associated with the expansion of a (CAG)n tract in the coding region of the causative gene, localized on 14q32.1. Machado-Joseph Disease shows non-Mendelian features typical of other triplet repeat disorders, including clinical heterogeneity, variable age at onset and anticipation. Three phenotypes have been proposed (clinical types 1, 2 and 3). Type 1 is associated with early age at onset and a high repeat number of the CAG sequence, and Types 2 and 3 have later onset and lower numbers of CAG repeats. This paper investigates whether there is selection against the MJD gene, acting through differential survival. nuptiality and fertility associated with clinical type and age at onset. The study sample comprised 40 MJD patients from the Azores (Portugal) having fully documented reproductive histories and known dates of death. The proportion of married patients of each clinical type increased from 0.22 among Type 1 patients, to 0.40 in Type 2 and 0.95 in Type 3. Age at onset and length of survival were also associated with marital status, with the married cases having later mean age at onset and longer mean survival time. In the whole sample, clinical type was associated with fertility, with significantly fewer children born to Type 1 patients. Among married patients clinical type was not associated with age at marriage, reproductive span or number of children. No reduction of fertility was detected among married patients in whom the onset of MJD was below the age of 50. The authors' interpretation of these results is that the high-repeat CAG haplotypes associated with early age at onset and clinical Type 1 are selected against through reduced survival and fertility. The fertility component of selection is mediated by nuptiality rather than marital fertility.</text></passage></document><document><id>386</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Spectrum of nonrandom associations between microsatellite loci on human chromosome 11p15.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>Most evidence about nonrandom association of alleles at different loci, or gametic disequilibrium, across extensive anonymous regions of the human genome is based on the analysis of overall disequilibrium between pairs of microsatellites. However, analysis of interallelic associations is also necessary for a more complete description of disequilibrium. Here, we report a study characterizing the frequency and strength of both overall and interallelic disequilibrium between pairs of 12 microsatellite loci (CA repeats) spanning 19 cM (14 Mb) on human chromosome 11p15, in a large sample (810 haplotypes deduced from 405 individuals) drawn from a single population. Characterization of disequilibrium was carried out, taking into account the sign of the observed disequilibria. This strategy facilitates detection of associations and gives more accurate estimates of their intensities. Our results demonstrate that the incidence of disequilibrium over an extensive human chromosomal region is much greater than is commonly considered for populations that have expanded in size. In total, 44% of the pairs of microsatellite loci and 18% of the pairs of alleles showed significant nonrandom association. All the loci were involved in disequilibrium, although both the frequency and strength of interallelic disequilibrium were distributed nonuniformly along 11p15. These findings are especially relevant since significant associations were detected between loci separated by as much as 17-19 cM (7 cM on average). It was also found that the overall disequilibrium masks complicated patterns of association between pairs of alleles, dependent on their frequency and size. We suggest that the complex mutational dynamics at microsatellite loci could explain the allele-dependent disequilibrium patterns. These observations are also relevant to evaluation of the usefulness of microsatellite markers for fine-scale localization of disease genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>387</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular basis for Duarte and Los Angeles variant galactosemia. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Human orythrocytes that are homozygous for the Duarte enzyme variant of galactosemia ( D / D ) have a characteristic isoform on isoelectric focusing and 50 % reduction in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase ( GALT ) enzyme activity . The Duarte biochemical phenotype has a molecular genotype of N314D / N314D . The characteristic Duarte isoform is also associated with a variant called the " Los Angeles ( LA ) phenotype , " which has increased GALT enzyme activity . We evaluated GALT enzyme activity and screened the GALT genes of 145 patients with one or more N314D-containing alleles . We found seven with the LA biochemical phenotype , and all had a 1721C-- > T transition in exon 7 in cis with the N314D missense mutation . The 1721C-- > T transition is a neutral polymorphism for leucine at amino acid 218 ( L218L ) . In pedigree analyses , this 1721C-- > T transition segregated with the LA phenotype of increased GALT activity in three different biochemical phenotypes ( LA / N , LA / G , and LA / D ) . To determine the mechanism for increased activity of the LA variant , we compared GALT mRNA , protein abundance , and enzyme thermal stability in lymphoblast cell lines of D and LA phenotypes with comparable genotypes . GALT protein abundance was increased in LA compared to D alleles , but mRNA was similar among all genotypes . When LA / D and D / D GALT biochemical phenotypes were compared to N / N GALT phenotypes , both had 50 % , as compared to 21 % , reduction in GALT activity in the wild type ( N / N ) after exposure at identical initial enzyme activity to 50 degrees C for 15 min . We conclude that the codon change N314D in cis with the base-pair transition 1721C-- > T produces the LA variant of galactosemia and that this nucleotide change increases GALT activity by increasing GALT protein abundance without increasing transcription or decreasing thermal lability . A favorable codon bias for the mutated codon with consequently increased translation rates is postulated as the mechanism . . </text></passage></document><document><id>388</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel missense mutations of TMPRSS3 in two consanguineous Tunisian families with non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>Recently the TMPRSS3 gene, which encodes a transmembrane serine protease, was found to be responsible for two non-syndromic recessive deafness loci located on human chromosome 21q22.3, DFNB8 and DFNB10. We found evidence for linkage to the DFNB8/10 locus in two unrelated consanguineous Tunisian families segregating congenital autosomal recessive sensorineural deafness. The audiometric tests showed a loss of hearing greater than 70 dB, in all affected individuals of both families. Mutation screening of TMPRSS3 revealed two novel missense mutations, W251C and P404L, altering highly conserved amino acids of the serine protease domain. Both mutations were not found in 200 control Tunisian chromosomes. The detection of naturally-occurring TMPRSS3 missense mutations in deafness families identifies functionally important amino acids. Comparative protein modeling of the TMPRSS3 protease domain predicted that W251C might lead to a structural rearrangement affecting the active site H257 and that P404L might alter the geometry of the active site loop and therefore affect the serine protease activity.</text></passage></document><document><id>389</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Exon-intron organization and chromosomal localization of the mouse monoglyceride lipase gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Monoglyceride lipase (MGL) functions together with hormone-sensitive lipase to hydrolyze intracellular triglyceride stores of adipocytes and other cells to fatty acids and glycerol.

Cosmid clones containing the mouse MGL gene were isolated from a genomic library using the coding region of the mouse MGL cDNA as probe.

This rare lesion, previously called metastatic carcinomatous cirrhosis, was also found, in this case, to have marked hepatic hemosiderosis, and analysis of the patient's DNA showed heterozygosity for the H63D genotype. The possibility of cirrhosis-associated hemosiderosis secondary to an iron metabolism abnormality associated with the H63D mutation of the HFE gene is proposed.

Hence, oxidation studies in fibroblasts, currently based on the use of racemic substrates such as [1-14C] pristanic acid, do not allow us to distinguish between a deficient racemase or an impaired oxidase. DESIGN: To evaluate the racemase activity directly, the 2R-isomer of[1-14C] pristanic acid, as well as the 2R-isomer of 2-methyl-[1-14C] hexadecanoic, a synthetic pristanic acid substitute, were prepared and their degradation by cultured human skin fibroblasts was compared to that of the racemic substrates. RESULTS: In fibroblasts in a young girl, presenting with elevated urinary levels of trihydroxycholestanoic acid metabolites but normal plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids, a partial deficient degradation of racemic [1-14C] pristanic acid was observed. Incorporation of 2R-[1-14C] pristanic acid in glycerolipids of the patient's fibroblasts proceeded normally, but breakdown was impaired. Similar findings were seen with the 2R-isomer of 2-methyl-[1-14C] hexadecanoic. These data, combined with the fact that the branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, catalyzing the first oxidation step of pristanic acid and bile acid intermediates in man, appeared normal, suggested a peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the patient at the level of 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase. CONCLUSION: Carboxy-labelled 2R-methyl branched chain fatty acids might be useful tools to document cases of racemase deficiencies. Because a brother of the patient died with a diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency, an impaired racemase might be responsible for other cases of unexplicable malabsorption.</text></passage></document><document><id>392</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>DNA sequence and physical mapping of the canine transglutaminase 1 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>The transglutaminase 1 gene (TGM1) encodes an enzyme necessary for cross-linking the structural proteins that form the cornified envelope, an essential component of the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum.

The resulting clinical phenotype (PWS or AS) in each class of genomic abnormalities depends on the parent of origin. Both disorders are characterized at the molecular level by abnormal methylation of imprinted regions at 15q11.2-q13. Other rare chromosome 15 rearrangements and a few smaller atypical deletions associated with abnormal methylation patterns also have symptoms overlapping with either PWS or AS. METHODS: We designed a methylation-specific melting analysis (MS-MA) method for a rapid screening of PWS/AS and evaluated methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) for diagnosis of PWS/AS associated with deletions, UPD15, or rare duplications. Forty-nine previously genotyped samples were tested by MS-MA. We also tested 26 MS-MA genotyped samples and 1 additional sample with rare duplication of chromosome region 15q11-q12. RESULTS: PWS/AS genotyping results obtained by MS-MA and by MS-MLPA were fully concordant. In addition, MS-MLPA was superior in detecting deletions/rare duplications, possible UPD15, or imprinting center defects, which were usually determined by a laborious fluorescence in situ hybridization method or by chromosomal segregation analysis for the parental-origin using short-tandem repeat makers. CONCLUSIONS: MS-MA appears to be an efficient primary method to diagnose PWS/AS, and use of the quantitative MS-MLPA method provides detailed information about deletions, rare duplications, and possibly UPD.</text></passage></document><document><id>394</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of tumor metastasis suppressor region on the short arm of human chromosome 20.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Acquisition of metastatic ability by prostate cancer cells is the hallmark of their lethal trait and outcome. However, the genetic alterations underlying the clinical progression and pathogenesis of prostate cancer are not well understood. Several studies involving loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and comparative genomic hybridization analysis have identified distinctively altered regions on various human chromosomes, and genomic imbalance of chromosome 20 was implicated in progression and recurrence of prostate tumors. To examine the role of chromosome 20 in prostate neoplasms, we introduced this chromosome into highly metastatic rat prostate cancer cells using the microcell-mediated chromosome transfer technique. Introduction of the chromosome resulted in significant suppression of the metastatic ability of the hybrid cells, by as much as 98%, without any interference with the in vivo growth rate or tumorigenicity of primary tumor in SCID mice. Our STS-PCR analysis on 10 hybrid clones indicates that the suppressor activity of chromosome 20 is located in the p11.23-12 region. Further examination of the hybrid clones by experimental metastasis assay and histologic analysis as well as Matrigel invasion assay suggests the involvement of the suppressor region at an early stage of invasion and extravasation. We also investigated the status of the chromosome 20 suppressor region in pathology specimens from human prostate cancer patients and detected the frequent loss of this region in high-grade tumors. These results suggest the presence of a putative suppressor gene on human chromosome 20 that is functionally involved in development of prostate cancer metastases.</text></passage></document><document><id>395</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Aerosol and lobar administration of a recombinant adenovirus to individuals with cystic fibrosis.

Gene transfer to airway epithelium, using adenoviruses containing normal CFTR cDNA, leads to transient production of CFTR mRNA and, in some studies, to correction of the airway epithelial ion transport defect caused by dysfunctional CFTR. Inflammatory responses to the adenoviral vector have been reported, particularly at high viral titers. We evaluated the effects of adenovirus-mediated CFTR gene transfer to airway epithelium in 36 subjects with CF (34 individuals, 2 of whom received two separate doses of vector), 20 by lobar instillation and 16 by aerosol administration. Doses ranged from 8 x 10(6) to 2.5 x 10(10) infective units (IU), in 0.5-log increments. After lobar administration of low doses there were occasional reports of cough, low-grade temperature, and myalgias. At the highest lobar dose (2.5 x 10(9) IU) two of three patients had transient myalgias, fever, and increased sputum production with obvious infiltrates on CT scan. After aerosol administration there were no significant systemic symptoms until the 2.5 x 10(10) IU dose, when both patients experienced myalgias and fever that resolved within 24 hr. There were no infiltrates seen on chest CT scans in any of the patients in the aerosol administration group. There were no consistent changes in pulmonary function tests or any significant rise in serum IgG or neutralizing antibodies in patients from either group. Serum, sputum, and nasal cytokines, measured before and after vector administration, showed no correlation with adenoviral dose. Gene transfer to lung cells was inefficient and expression was transient. Cells infected with the vector included mononuclear inflammatory cells as well as cuboidal and columnar epithelial cells. In summary, we found no consistent immune response, no evidence of viral shedding, and no consistent change in pulmonary function in response to adenovirus-mediated CFTR gene transfer. At higher doses there was a mild, nonspecific inflammatory response, as evidenced by fevers and myalgias. Overall, vector administration was tolerated but transfer of CFTR cDNA was inefficient and transgene expression was transient for the doses and method of administration used here.</text></passage></document><document><id>396</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular pathways involved in response to ionizing radiation of ID-8 mouse ovarian cancer cells expressing exogenous full-length Brca1 or truncated Brca1 mutant.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>163</offset><text>BRCA1 germline mutations have been linked to the development of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.

Expression of truncated, but not full-length, Brca1 then allowed us to identify new potential downstream targets of mutated BRCA1 like MAPK/ERK pathway members and also key genes involved in mutated BRCA1 signaling pathway response to ionizing radiation such as p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1.

Among them, we report here the further analyses of eight genes, EGR2/Krox-20, BPOZ, APS, HCLS1/HS1, DUSP1/MKP1, NDRG1/Drg1/RTP, NFIL3/E4BP4, and a novel gene (PINK1, PTEN-induced putative kinase). Expression of six of them (PINK1, EGR2, HCLS1, DUSP1, BPOZ, and NFIL3) was decreased in ovarian tumors compared with corresponding normal tissues. Colony-formation assays using plasmid clones designed to express each gene indicated that EGR2 and BPOZ were able to suppress growth of cancer cells significantly; in particular, cancer-cell lines stably expressing BPOZ grew more slowly than control cells containing mock vector. Flow cytometry suggested that over-expression of BPOZ inhibited progression of the cell cycle at the G(1)/S transition. Anti-sense oligonucleotides for BPOZ or EGR2 effectively inhibited their expression, and cell growth was accelerated.

In addition, needle EMG, sensory nerve conduction velocities, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and cervical MRI or plain X-ray of the neck were also recorded. RESULTS: Three cases were segregated from the other 9 patients because of predominant upper motor neuron signs with pseudobulbar palsy and abnormal posterior tibial nerve and/or median nerve SEPs.

The allelic methylation of the latter opposes that of the FMR promoter and serves as an internal control and standard for semiquantitative analyses. This system enables the delineation of 11 distinct patterns encountered in nonaffected, carrier, and affected males and females. We have evaluated our system on well-defined samples with different FMR1 mutations and have used it for the diagnostic evaluation of 253 male and 80 female probands. In the male group, we have identified five full mutations, and three gray-zone and premutation alleles with 54, 55, and 62 repeats, respectively. The female group consists of 33 normal homozygote and 41 heterozygote individuals, two of whom harbor a gray-zone allele with 47 repeats, none with a premutation, and six with a full mutation. Our MS-PCR approach allows the currently most comprehensive diagnostic evaluation of the FRAXA syndrome in a cost- and time-efficient fashion. In addition, it is a valuable tool for the analysis of clonality and skewing phenomena in females.</text></passage></document><document><id>400</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>ATM status confers sensitivity to arsenic cytotoxic effects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset><text>Arsenic (As), a human carcinogen, represents a worldwide health problem due to the high number of people exposed to this element in their drinking water. Previously our group has demonstrated that As can impair lymphocyte cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and can increase the level of P53 protein, with different responses to these effects between individuals. Recently it has been shown that ATM protein, responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), regulates P53. In this study the induced response of P53 was evaluated following exposure to As in human lymphoblastoid cell lines normal (+/+), heterozygous (+/-) or homozygous (-/-) for the mutant ATM gene. After 24 h As treatment we found a dose-dependent induction of P53 in normal and heterozygous cell lines, although differences between cell lines were observed. An increase in P21(WAF) protein, a main effector of P53 activation, was also observed in the same cell lines. In contrast, neither P53 nor P21 induction was detected in homozygous cells. The ATM (+/-) and (-/-) genotypes confer more sensitivity to As cytotoxic effects than the normal allelic condition. Paradoxically, ATM heterozygous cells were more sensitive to As, leading us to propose that this might be related to activation of apoptosis and removal of non-repairable cells. In contrast, in AT cells in which ATM is absent or mutated activation of P53 and its target genes is abrogated, allowing cells to replicate with damage in the presence of As, with cell death ensuing by a pathway different from P53.</text></passage></document><document><id>401</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Contrasting histories of G6PD molecular evolution and malarial resistance in humans and chimpanzees.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>Although mutations in the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene result in several blood-related diseases in humans, they also confer resistance to malarial infection. This association between G6PD and malaria was supported by population genetic analyses of the G6PD locus, which indicated that these mutations may have recently risen in frequency in certain geographic regions as a result of positive selection. Here we characterize nucleotide sequence variation in a 5.2-kb region of the G6PD locus in a population sample of 56 chimpanzees, as well as among 7 other nonhuman primates, to compare with that in humans in determining whether other primates that are impacted by malaria also exhibit patterns of G6PD polymorphism or divergence consistent with positive selection. We find that chimpanzees have several amino acid variants but that the overall pattern at G6PD in chimpanzees, as well as in Old and New World primates in general, can be explained by recent purifying selection as well as strong functional constraint dating back to at least 30-40 MYA. These comparative analyses suggest that the recent signature of positive selection at G6PD in humans is unique.</text></passage></document><document><id>402</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel mutation in the TOR1A (DYT1) gene in atypical early onset dystonia and polymorphisms in dystonia and early onset parkinsonism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>133</offset><text>Dystonia is a movement disorder involving sustained muscle contractions and abnormal posturing with a strong hereditary predisposition and without a distinct neuropathology. In this study the TOR1A (DYT1) gene was screened for mutations in cases of early onset dystonia and early onset parkinsonism (EOP), which frequently presents with dystonic symptoms. In a screen of 40 patients, we identified three variations, none of which occurred in EOP patients. Two infrequent intronic single base pair (bp) changes of unknown consequences were found in a dystonia patient and the mother of an EOP patient. An 18-bp deletion (Phe323_Tyr328del) in the TOR1A gene was found in a patient with early onset dystonia and myoclonic features. This deletion would remove 6 amino acids close to the carboxy terminus, including a putative phosphorylation site of torsinA. This 18-bp deletion is the first additional mutation, beyond the GAG-deletion (Glu302/303del), to be found in the TOR1A gene, and is associated with a distinct type of early onset dystonia.</text></passage></document><document><id>403</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever: prevalence, penetrance and genetic drift.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>FMF is widely distributed in populations inhabiting the Mediterranean basin.

Five mutations accounted for 91% of FMF chromosomes in our patients. Mutation M694V, predominant in North African Jews, was observed in all patients other than Ashkenazi Jews; mutation V726A was prevalent among all patients other than North African Jews; mutations M694I and M680I were mainly confined to Arab patients. Overall carrier rates, for four mutations (M680I, M694V, V726A, E148Q), were extremely high in our healthy cohort composed of Ashkenazi (n=407); Moroccan (n=243); Iraqi Jews (n=205); and Muslim Arabs (n=318); calculated at 1 : 4.5; 1 : 4.7; 1 : 3.5 and 1 : 4.3 respectively. The V726A allele prevalent among Ashkenazi and Iraqi Jews and Muslim Arabs (carrier rates: 7.4, 12.8 and 7.3%, respectively) was not found among Moroccan Jews. The M694V allele detected among Moroccan and Iraqi Jews and Muslim Arabs (carrier rates 11.1, 2.9 and 0.6%, respectively) was not observed among Ashkenazim. The overall frequency of mutations V726A and E148Q in Ashkenazim, Iraqi Jews and Arabs indicates that the bulk of individuals that comply with the genetic definition of FMF remain asymptomatic.</text></passage></document><document><id>404</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a H+/glucose and galactose symporter gene glt from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>We identified a glucose and galactose transporter gene from the plant-pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.

It is divided into three types according to the presence and progression of neurologic symptoms. Of those, type II is relatively rare and most severe; patients usually die before the age of two years. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of GBA gene in five Taiwanese type II GD patients, we identified two novel mutations: G355D and three-nucleotide insertion in exon 7 of GBA. The latter resulted in an in-frame insertion of a methionine residue between Leu241 and Ser242. L444P, the second most common GD allele among non-Jewish Caucasian population, was found in all five type II GD patients (50%). Overall, 9 out of 10 GD alleles were identified in this study. Direct sequencing of all PCR products led to high detection rate of GD alleles and identification of the RecNci 1 alleles. In the future, high throughput sequencing will make it possible identifying more rare mutations in type II GD patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>406</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Rapid detection of the two common mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with mucolipidosis type IV.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>Among Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with mucolipidosis IV (ML IV), two mutations in the ML IV gene, IVS3-1A --> G and delEX1-EX7, account for more than 95% of disease alleles. The reported method of genotyping for the delEX1-EX7 mutation involves a cumbersome multistep procedure. In the present study, a new simplified one-step procedure is described that detects this mutation in both patients and carriers. An improved procedure is also described for detection of the IVS3-1A --> G mutation. Using these improved procedures, we have characterized the ML IV mutant alleles in 27 patients and 95 of their relatives from 22 families, and in 123 unrelated and unaffected Ashkenazi Jewish controls. Of the 27 ML IV patients, 16 patients (59.3%) were found to be homozygous for the IVS3-1A --> G mutation and 1 patient (3.7%) homozygous for the delEX1-EX7 mutation. Additionally, 9 patients (33.3%) were compound heterozygotes for IVS3-1A --> G/delEX1-EX7. Among the 123 Ashkenazi Jewish controls, two individuals were identified as heteroallelic with one IVS3-1A --> G mutation (carrier frequency: approximately 1 in 61); none showed the delEX1-EX7 mutation.

Since sex steroid hormones have been shown to play important roles in the sex determination of frogs, it is of interest to know how SF-1 gene expression is regulated during the sexual development of this organism. A previous study isolated the cDNA of the frog Rana rugosa SF-1 (rrSF-1) and found sexual differences in its gene expression in adult frogs; positive in testis and negative in ovary (Kawano et al., 1998). This study examined rrSF-1 gene expression in frog embryos and developing and mature gonads by immunohistochemical staining using anti-rrSF-1 protein antibody for protein localization and by in situ hybridization analysis for mRNA transcription. The results obtained in this study indicated that cells expressing SF-1 that originate in the mesoderm and endoderm probably migrate into the developing gonad via the dorsal mesentery, genital ridge, and mesorchium or mesovarium. Thus, SF-1 may play an important role in gonadal development in amphibians.</text></passage></document><document><id>408</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Frataxin deficiency enhances apoptosis in cells differentiating into neuroectoderm.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>Deficiency of the mitochondrial matrix protein frataxin causes Friedreich ataxia. Frataxin function is believed to be related to mitochondrial iron metabolism and free radical production. In Friedreich ataxia, loss of dorsal root ganglia neurons occurs early in life, suggesting a developmental process. In addition, frataxin knockout mice die during embryonic life, further suggesting that frataxin is necessary for normal development. In this study we examine the role of frataxin in neuronal differentiation by using the P19 embryonic carcinoma cell line as a model system. We produced stably transfected clones with antisense or sense frataxin constructs. During retinoic acid-induced neurogenesis of frataxin-deficient cells there was a striking rise in cell death, while cell division remained unaffected. However, frataxin deficiency does not affect cell survival in cells induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Frataxin deficiency enhances apoptosis of retinoic acid-stimulated cells, and the number of neuronal-like cells expressing MAP2 was dramatically reduced in these clones. In addition, we found that antisense clones induced to differentiate into neuroectoderm with retinoic acid have increased production of reactive oxygen species, and that only cells non-committed to the neuronal lineages could be rescued by the addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). However, NAC treatment had no effect in increasing the number of terminally differentiated neuronal-like cells in frataxin-deficient clones. Our results suggest that frataxin deficiency may render cells susceptible to apoptosis after exposure to appropriate stimuli.</text></passage></document><document><id>409</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-kappaB interacts with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) corepressors HDAC1 and HDAC2 to negatively regulate gene expression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>151</offset><text>Regulation of NF-kappaB transactivation function is controlled at several levels, including interactions with coactivator proteins. Here we show that the transactivation function of NF-kappaB is also regulated through interaction of the p65 (RelA) subunit with histone deacetylase (HDAC) corepressor proteins. Our results show that inhibition of HDAC activity with trichostatin A (TSA) results in an increase in both basal and induced expression of an integrated NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays show that TSA treatment causes hyperacetylation of the wild-type integrated NF-kappaB-dependent reporter but not of a mutant version in which the NF-kappaB binding sites were mutated. Expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 repressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. Consistent with this, we show that HDAC1 and HDAC2 target NF-kappaB through a direct association of HDAC1 with the Rel homology domain of p65. HDAC2 does not interact with NF-kappaB directly but can regulate NF-kappaB activity through its association with HDAC1. Finally, we show that inhibition of HDAC activity with TSA causes an increase in both basal and TNF-induced expression of the NF-kappaB-regulated interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene. Similar to the wild-type integrated NF-kappaB-dependent reporter, ChIP assays showed that TSA treatment resulted in hyperacetylation of the IL-8 promoter. These data indicate that the transactivation function of NF-kappaB is regulated in part through its association with HDAC corepressor proteins. Moreover, it suggests that the association of NF-kappaB with the HDAC1 and HDAC2 corepressor proteins functions to repress expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes as well as to control the induced level of expression of these genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>410</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a new mutation in the alpha4(IV) collagen gene in a family with autosomal dominant Alport syndrome and hypercholesterolaemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>144</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary disease of the glomerular basement membrane in the kidney characterized by progressive renal failure, sensorineural deafness, and/or ocular abnormalities. In contrast to the well-known X-linked phenotype, very little is known about the autosomal dominant form. Rare autosomal forms of AS have been described with mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 at chromosome region 2q35-q37, but there have been no descriptions of dominant forms due to a mutation in COL4A4. METHODS: We describe a Sardinian family with a classical AS-phenotype plus hypercholesterolaemia, a clinical feature also present in Fechtner syndrome (FS), a disease that segregates as an autosomal dominant trait. RESULTS: A suggestive linkage (LOD=2.7) between AS and the COL4A3/A4 locus at 2q35-q37 was identified. Other candidate collagen genes encoding basement membrane collagen (COL4A1/A2 and COL4A5/A6) were excluded by linkage analysis (13q33-q34 and Xq22), or by sequence (COL4A3). DNA sequence analysis of the COL4A4 gene revealed that the Lys325Asn mutation was present in all affected family members, but was absent in all unaffected members and in a random sample of the Sardinian population. A clear indication of a gene-dosage effect was seen in the most severely affected family member, since she carried the mutation in the homozygous form. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the importance of collagen 4A4 as a component in the structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and confirm the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of collagen disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>411</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genomic organization of the human thyroglobulin gene: the complete intron-exon structure.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: In order to complete the knowledge of the genomic organization of the human thyroglobulin gene, the present work was designed to establish the intron-exon organization from exon 24 to exon 35 and to construct a more complete physical map of the gene. DESIGN: Screening of two genomic libraries, and subsequent restriction mapping, hybridization and sequencing were used to characterize the recombinant phages. METHODS: Two human genomic DNA libraries were screened by in situ hybridization. Southern blotting experiments were performed to characterize the phage inserts. The Long PCR method was used to amplify the genomic DNA region containing exon 24. Intron-exon junction sequences were determined by using the Taq polymerase-based chain termination method. RESULTS: We isolated and characterized five lambda phage clones that include nucleotides 4933 to 6262 of the thyroglobulin mRNA, encompassing exons 25-35 of the gene. The remaining exon 24 (nucleotides 4817-4932) was sequenced from the amplified fragment. In total, 8010 intronic bases were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the five phages isolated and the amplified fragment include 59.4 kb genomic DNA, covering 1446 nucleotides of exonic sequence distributed over 12 exons, from exon 24 to exon 35. Using previous studies and our current data, 220 kb of the human thyroglobulin gene was analyzed, a physical map was constructed, and all exon-intron junctions were sequenced and correlated with the different domains of the protein. In summary, the thyroglobulin gene contains 48 exons ranging in size from 63 nucleotides to 1101 nucleotides.</text></passage></document><document><id>412</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Ser968Thr mutation within the A3 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in two related patients leads to a defective binding of VWF to collagen.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>144</offset><text>We report the identification of a new mutation of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) gene within exon 30 occurring in two related patients (mother and daughter) with a hemorrhagic syndrome. A T-->A transvertion at nucleotide 5441 was found changing the serine 968 to threonine of the mature VWF subunit (S1731T of the preproVWF). The Ser968Thr mutation is located within the VWF A3 domain which interacts with type I and III collagens. Both patients were found to be heterozygous for the mutation. The propositus (daughter) exhibited a slightly prolonged bleeding time, levels of VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo at the lower limit of normal, contrasting with normal levels of VIII:C. Her mother exhibited borderline bleeding time and moderately decreased levels of VWF and VIII:C. In both patients multimeric structure of VWF and ristocetin- as well as botrocetin-induced binding of VWF to GPIb were normal; however both patients repeatedly showed decreased binding of VWF to collagen. The Ser968Thr substitution was reproduced by site-directed mutagenesis on the full-length cDNA of VWF. The mutated recombinant VWF (rVWF), T968rVWF, and the hybrid S/T968rVWF were transiently expressed by COS-7 cells. Both rVWF exhibited normal multimeric pattern and normal ristocetin- as well as botrocetin-induced binding to GPIb. T968rVWF showed significantly decreased binding to collagen while the hybrid S/T968rVWF bound to collagen in a similar way to that of the patients' plasma VWF. Thus, our data demonstrate that the Ser968Thr mutation of the VWF A3 domain is clearly responsible for the abnormal binding of VWF to collagen observed in both patients. The Ser968Thr substitution of the VWF is the first mutation identified in two patients leading to a decreased affinity of VWF for collagen and a normal multimeric structure.</text></passage></document><document><id>413</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis and other hexosaminidase mutations among Jews.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset></passage></document><document><id>414</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Expression and function of Xenopus laevis p75(NTR) suggest evolution of developmental regulatory mechanisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>Neurotrophins signal through two different classes of receptors, members of the trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. While neurotrophin binding to trks results in, among other things, increased cell survival, p75(NTR) has enigmatically been implicated in promoting both survival and cell death. Which of these two signals p75(NTR) imparts depends on the specific cellular context. Xenopus laevis is an excellent system in which to study p75(NTR) function in vivo because of its amenability to experimental manipulation. We therefore cloned partial cDNAs of two p75(NTR) genes from Xenopus, which we have termed p75(NTR)a and p75(NTR)b. We then cloned two different cDNAs, both of which encompass the full coding region of p75(NTR)a. Early in development both p75(NTR)a and p75(NTR)b are expressed in developing cranial ganglia and presumptive spinal sensory neurons, similar to what is observed in other species. Later, p75(NTR)a expression largely continues to parallel p75(NTR) expression in other species. However, Xenopus p75(NTR)a is additionally expressed in the neuroepithelium of the anterior telencephalon, all layers of the retina including the photoreceptor layer, and functioning axial skeletal muscle. Finally, misexpression of full length p75(NTR) and each of two truncated mutants in developing retina reveal that p75(NTR) probably signals for cell survival in this system. This result contrasts with the reported role of p75(NTR) in developing retinae of other species, and the possible implications of this difference are discussed.</text></passage></document><document><id>415</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Phylogenetic aspects of the complement system.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>47</offset><text>During evolution two general systems of immunity have emerged: innate or, natural immunity and adaptive (acquired), or specific immunity. The innate system is phylogenetically older and is found in some form in all multicellular organisms, whereas the adaptive system appeared about 450 million years ago and is found in all vertebrates except jawless fish. The complement system in higher vertebrates plays an important role as an effector of both the innate and the acquired immune response, and also participates in various immunoregulatory processes. In lower vertebrates complement is activated by the alternative and lectin pathways and is primarily involved in the opsonization of foreign material. The Agnatha (the most primitive vertebrate species) possess the alternative and lectin pathways while cartilaginous fish are the first species in which the classical pathway appears following the emergence of immunoglobulins. The rest of the poikilothermic species, ranging from teleosts to reptilians, appear to contain a well-developed complement system resembling that of the homeothermic vertebrates. It seems that most of the complement components have appeared after the duplication of primordial genes encoding C3/C4/C5, fB/C2, C1s/C1r/MASP-1/MASP-2, and C6/C7/C8/C9 molecules, in a process that led to the formation of distinct activation pathways. However, unlike homeotherms, several species of poikilotherms (e.g. trout) have recently been shown to possess multiple forms of complement components (C3, factor B) that are structurally and functionally more diverse than those of higher vertebrates. We hypothesize that this remarkable diversity has allowed these animals to expand their innate capacity for immune recognition and response. Recent studies have also indicated the possible presence of complement receptors in protochordates and lower vertebrates. In conclusion, there is considerable evidence suggesting that the complement system is present in the entire lineage of deuterostomes, and regulatory complement components have been identified in all species beyond the protochordates, indicating that the mechanisms of complement activation and regulation have developed in parallel.</text></passage></document><document><id>416</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Electroencephalographic findings in children with phenylketonuria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset><text>The electroencephalographic findings of 90 patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) who were observed in one clinic were critically reviewed.

Our data exemplify that the inactivation of STK11 can be due to unusual disturbances in splicing regulation which result in truncations of the protein. However, nonsense mediated mRNA decay must be blocked with puromycin to detect shortened STK11 gene products contained in the leucocytic mRNA pool of PJS patients. Interestingly, two mutations escaped from detection by exon sequencing techniques with usual flanking PCR primers, since alterations were located right in the middle of intronic sequences. We describe a compound heterozygous PJS patient who carried two different mutations in intron 1 on separate alleles. Each of the two mutations was transmitted individually to one of his two children.

Mixtures of highly purified CoVF, B, and D were chemotactic for human neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes as assessed in Boyden chambers either by microscopic enumeration of migrating cells or by counting of 51Cr-labeled cells. Control mixtures containing CoVF, B, and D, reacted in the absence of Mg++, were hemolytically inactive and devoid of chemotactic activity. Over a range of doses, the chemotactic activity of mixtures yielding CoVFB correlated with their hemolytic activity. Pretreatment of neutrophils with mixtures containing CoVFB rendered them unresponsive to subsequent chemotactic stimulation by kallikrein of C5a, indicating cross-deactivation to other chemotactic factors. Similar neutrophil deactivation occurred after exposure to a mixture of C3b, B, and D in which C3B was formed; with short incubation times and high cell concentration C3B also exhibited some chemotactic activity. The chemotactic activity of C3B and CoVFB is an example of a biologic function arising from interactions among factors of the properdin pathway per se, as distinguished from the capacity of this pathway to activate C3 and the terminal complement sequence.</text></passage></document><document><id>421</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The molecular biology of von Willebrand disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>49</offset><text>von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common autosomally inherited bleeding disorder associated with mucosal or trauma-related bleeding in affected individuals. VWD results from either a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF)--a glycoprotein with essential roles in primary haemostasis and as a carrier of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation. In recent years the identification of mutations in the VWF gene in patients with VWD has improved our understanding of the structure and function of the VWF protein, and has illustrated the importance of specific regions of VWF for its interaction with other components of the vasculature. The underlying genetic lesions and associated molecular pathology have been identified in many cases of type 2A, type 2B, type 2M, type 2N and type 3 VWD. However in the most common variant, type 1 VWD, the causative molecular defect is unknown in the large majority of cases. In the absence of an understanding of the molecular pathology underlying type 1 VWD, precise diagnosis and classification of this common disorder remains problematic.</text></passage></document><document><id>422</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evidence of a founder effect for the protein C gene 3363 inserted C mutation in thrombophilic pedigrees of French origin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>We have previously reported that the 3363 inserted (Ins) C mutation in exon 6 of the protein C gene was present in four unrelated French patients and in four French Canadian families with type I protein C deficiency as well as in a large Vermont protein C deficient kindred of French Canadian origin. The present study was designed to investigate the likelihood of the existence of a founder effect for this mutation in protein C deficient individuals of French origin living in France, Quebec and Vermont. In order to demonstrate a possible founder effect for the 3363 InsC mutation, we have previously constructed a high-resolution genetic map to locate several highly polymorphic markers close to the protein C locus. Thereafter, the markers D2S347, D2S2339, D2S383, D2S2271 and D2S2215 were genotyped in 117 heterozygotes from France (n = 7), Quebec (n = 36) or Vermont (n = 74). The allelic frequency distribution of these five markers was also determined in fifty control French Canadian subjects and thirty-two unaffected members of the Vermont kindred with normal protein C levels and compared with their frequency in our cohort of heterozygotes. Our data suggest that patients from Quebec and Vermont carry a common haplotype at the protein C locus. Moreover, in order to study the evolutionary history of the 3363 InsC mutation, we traced back the ascending genealogy of one proband in each of the families with this mutation. These results showed that the 3363 InsC mutation was most probably introduced in North America by a couple of French settlers who established themselves in 1669 on Isle d'Orleans located near Quebec City. All heterozygotes for the 3363 InsC mutation living in North America are related to these founders within 10 generations. Thus, these families afford a unique opportunity to evaluate the role of the protein C system in thrombophilia due to the high degree of linkage disequilibrium at the protein C gene, which in essence holds that variable more constant than in a more heterogeneous population.</text></passage></document><document><id>423</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>5-lipoxygenase regulates malignant mesothelial cell survival: involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>Evidence indicates that lipoxygenases (LO) may play a role in cancer cell survival. We show that human malignant pleural mesothelial (MM) cells, but not normal mesothelial (NM) cells, express a catalytically active 5-LO. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of MM cell 5-LO determined nucleosome formation and induced a DNA fragmentation pattern typical of apoptosis. This was completely reversed by exogenously added 5(S)-HETE but not by 12(S)-, 15(S)-HETE, or leukotriene (LT)B4. A 5-LO antisense oligonucleotide potently and time-dependently reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and constitutive VEGF accumulation in the conditioned media of MM cells. When NM cells were transfected with a 5-LO cDNA, basal and arachidonic acid-induced VEGF formation increased consistently by 6- and 12-fold, respectively. This was associated with a significant increase in DNA synthesis that was counteracted by a specific anti-VEGF antibody. Arachidonic acid and 5(S)-HETE also potently stimulated the activity of a VEGF promoter construct. Thus, 5-LO is a key regulator of MM cell proliferation and survival via a VEGF-related circuit.</text></passage></document><document><id>424</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Gene replacement therapy in the retinal degeneration slow (rds) mouse: the effect on retinal degeneration following partial transduction of the retina.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>152</offset><text>The retinal degeneration slow (rds or Prph2(Rd2/Rd2)) mouse, a model of recessive retinitis pigmentosa, lacks a functional gene encoding peripherin 2. This membrane glycoprotein is required for the formation of photoreceptor outer segment discs. The striking feature of the rds mouse is the complete failure to develop outer segments. We have previously examined the short-term effect of gene replacement therapy using an adeno-associated (AAV) vector and demonstrated induction of outer segments and improvement of photoreceptor function. Here we have extended our analysis and have demonstrated that the potential for ultrastructural improvement is dependent upon the age at which animals are treated, but the effect of a single injection on photoreceptor ultrastructure may be long-term. However, there was no significant effect on photoreceptor cell loss, irrespective of the date of administration, despite the improvements in morphology and function. Our investigation excluded procedure-related damage, vector toxicity and immune responses as major factors which might counteract the benefits of photoreceptor restoration, but suggested that transgene over-expression is of significance. These findings suggest that successful gene therapy in patients with photoreceptor defects may ultimately depend upon intervention in early stages of disease and upon accurate control of transgene expression.</text></passage></document><document><id>425</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Type 1 von Willebrand disease mutation Cys1149Arg causes intracellular retention and degradation of heterodimers: a possible general mechanism for dominant mutations of oligomeric proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>190</offset><text>Some families affected by von Willebrand disease type 1 show high penetrance with exceptionally low von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels. Previously, a mutation associated with this dominant phenotype, Cys1149Arg, was found to decrease the secretion of coexpressed normal VWF, and the mutation was proposed to cause intracellular retention of pro-VWF heterodimers. To demonstrate heterodimer formation, a model was developed in which subunits could be distinguished immunologically and by size. Recombinant VWF lacking domain A1 (dA1), A3 (dA3), or both (dA13) was secreted efficiently as a full range of multimers. Cotransfection of Cys1149Arg and dA13 resulted in the secretion of multimeric VWF containing about 250 kd (Cys1149Arg) and about 210 kd (dA13). Cell lysates contained pro-VWF forms of Cys1149Arg and dA13. Immunoprecipitation with an antidomain A1 antibody recovered both subunits in heterodimers, and subunit ratios were consistent with random dimerization. Similar results were obtained for cotransfection of Cys1149Arg and dA1. Normal VWF has a Cys1149-Cys1169 intrachain bond. When cotransfected with normal VWF, Cys1149Arg or the double mutant Cys1149Arg+Cys1169Ser caused a similar decrease in VWF secretion, suggesting that an unpaired Cys1169 does not explain the intracellular retention of Cys1149Arg. VWF Cys1149Arg was not secreted from BHK cells but was degraded intracellularly within about 4 hours, and the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin delayed its clearance more than 16 hours. Thus, dominant von Willebrand disease type 1 may be caused by heterodimerization of mutant and normal subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum followed by proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm. A similar dominant negative mechanism could cause quantitative deficiencies of other multisubunit proteins.</text></passage></document><document><id>426</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>24</offset></passage></document><document><id>427</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular defects of the C7 gene in two patients with complement C7 deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Different genetic mutations have been described in complement components resulting in total or subtotal deficiency states. In this work we report the genetic basis of C7 deficiency in a previously reported Spanish patient exhibiting a combined total deficiency of C7 and C4B associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Exon-specific polymerase chain reaction and sequencing revealed a not previously described single base mutation in exon 10 (T1458A) leading to a stop codon that causes the premature truncation of the C7 protein (C464X). Additionally, a C to A transversion at position 1561 (exon 11) was found in the patient resulting in an amino acid change (R499S). This latter mutation has been previously reported in individuals with subtotal C7 deficiency or with combined subtotal C6/C7 deficiency from widely spaced geographical areas. Another novel mutation was found in a second patient with meningococcal meningitis of Bolivian and Czech origin; a 11-base pair deletion of nucleotides 631-641 in exon 6 leading to the generation of a downstream stop codon causing the premature truncation of the C7 protein product (T189 x 193). This patient was found to be a heterozygous compound for another mutation in C7; a two-base pair deletion of nucleotides 1922 and 1923, 1923 and 1924 or 1924 and 1925 in exon 14 (1922delAG/1923delGA/1924delAG), leading again to the generation of a downstream stop codon that provokes the truncation of the C7 protein (S620x630). This latter mutation has been recently reported by our group in another Spanish family.

We also show that ATM activation is involved in the apoptotic response to UVA but not UVC. Furthermore, we provide evidence that ATM-dependent p53 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways are linked to UVA-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, UVC-induced apoptosis occurs through ATR-dependent p53 phosphorylation as well as the JNK pathway. Therefore, these results suggest that ATM, like p53, is involved in the UVA-induced apoptosis to suppress carcinogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>430</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Direct interaction of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor with leukemia-associated RhoGEF.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset><text>Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 plays crucial roles in growth control and rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor and thereby induces the autophosphorylation of this receptor at its tyrosine residues. The phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor is thought to initiate a cascade of events. Although various signaling molecules have been identified, they appear to interact with the tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF-1 receptor. Here, we identified leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (LARG), which contains the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ), regulator of G protein signaling (RGS), Dbl homology, and pleckstrin homology domains, as a nonphosphorylated IGF-1 receptor-interacting molecule. LARG formed a complex with the IGF-1 receptor in vivo, and the PDZ domain of LARG interacted directly with the COOH-terminal domain of IGF-1 receptor in vitro. LARG had an exchange activity for Rho in vitro and induced the formation of stress fibers in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. When MDCKII epithelial cells were treated with IGF-1, Rho and its effector Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase) were activated and actin stress fibers were enhanced. Furthermore, the IGF-1-induced Rho-kinase activation and the enhancement of stress fibers were inhibited by ectopic expression of the PDZ and RGS domains of LARG. Taken together, these results indicate that IGF-1 activates the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway via a LARG/IGF-1 receptor complex and thereby regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements.</text></passage></document><document><id>431</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Biochemical studies of a human low-activity galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase variant.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>A low activity galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (transferase) variant in a newborn infant has been demonstrated by biochemical studies in erythrocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts.

When a heterozygote is produced, transmission is dominant autosomal. The phenotype shows wide variation and severity depends on the mechanism and location of the mutation.

However, the mechanisms involved in its epithelial differentiation are unknown, and furthermore, the determinants for histological subtype in synovial sarcoma remain unclear. In this study, we immunohistochemically examined E-cadherin expression and screened for genetic alterations in the E-cadherin gene from exon 4 to exon 9 in 49 cases of synovial sarcoma. In addition, we also examined the mRNA expressions of E-cadherin and Snail, a direct repressor of E-cadherin gene expression, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 20 samples of frozen material. Immunohistochemical E-cadherin membranous expression was observed in 12 cases (24.5%), and was predominant in biphasic tumors. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by DNA direct sequencing revealed 15 missense E-cadherin mutations in 12 cases (24.5%: monophasic, 11 of 42; biphasic, 1 of 6; poorly, 0 of 1) and 7 silent mutations (14.3%) in 7 cases. Ten of the 12 cases with E-cadherin missense mutations did not show E-cadherin membranous expression. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated E-cadherin and Snail mRNA expressions in 14 cases (70%) and in all cases, respectively. E-cadherin gene expression was inactivated by missense mutations in three of the eight cases (37.5%) of monophasic fibrous tumors that showed E-cadherin mRNA expressions. The E-cadherin gene was potentially inactivated in a significant number of synovial sarcomas. E-cadherin dysfunction because of its mutation in the central region of the molecule was associated with its decreased immunohistochemical expression and histological fibroblastic and spindle-shaped features of monophasic tumors. Thus, E-cadherin gene mutation may be one of the determinants of histological subtype in synovial sarcoma.</text></passage></document><document><id>434</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Suppression of revertant fibers in mdx mice by expression of a functional dystrophin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset><text>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration that results from the absence of dystrophin. Despite null mutations in the dystrophin gene, many DMD patients display a low percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers. These "revertant fibers" are also present in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse and are believed to result from alternative splicing or second mutation events that bypass the mutation and restore an open reading frame. However, it is unclear what role dystrophin and the dystrophic pathology might play in revertant fiber formation and accumulation. We have analyzed the role of dystrophin expression and the dystrophic pathology in this process by monitoring revertant fibers in transgenic mdx mice that express truncated dystrophins. We found that newborn transgenic mice displayed approximately the same number of revertant fibers as newborn mdx mice, indicating that expression of a functional dystrophin does not suppress the initiation of revertant fiber formation. Surprisingly, when the transgene encoded a functional dystrophin, revertant fibers were not detected in adult or old mdx mice. In contrast, adult transgenic mice expressing a non-functional dystrophin accumulated increasing numbers of revertant fibers, similar to mdx mice, suggesting that positive selection is required for the persistence of revertant fibers. Finally, we provide evidence that the loss of revertant dystrophin in transgenic mdx muscle fibers overexpressing a functional dystrophin results from displacement of the revertant protein by the transgene-encoded dystrophin.</text></passage></document><document><id>435</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Localization of human BRCA1 and its loss in high-grade, non-inherited breast carcinomas. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>Although the link between the BRCA1 tumour-suppressor gene and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer is established , the role , if any , of BRCA1 in non-familial cancers is unclear .

They account for about 85% of all lissencephalies. Lissencephaly with posteriorly predominant gyral abnormality is caused by mutations of the LIS1 gene on chromosome 17. Anteriorly predominant lissencephaly in hemizygous males and subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) in heterozygous females are caused by mutations of the XLIS(or DCX) gene. Mutations of the coding region of XLIS were found in all reported pedigrees, and in most sporadic female patients with SBH. Missense mutations of both LIS1 and XLIS genes have been observed in some of the rare male patients with SBH. Autosomal recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia has been associated with mutations of the reelin gene. With few exceptions, children with lissencephaly have severe developmental delay and infantile spasms early in life. Patients with SBH have a mild to severe mental retardation with epilepsy of variable severity and type. X-linked bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (BPNH) consists of typical BPNH with focal epilepsy in females and prenatal lethality in males. About 88% of patients have focal epilepsy. Filamin A (FLNA) mutations have been reported in some families and in sporadic patients. Additional, possibly autosomal recessive gene(s) are likely to be involved in causing BPNH non-linked to FLN1. Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a dominant disorder caused by mutations in at lest two genes, TSC1 and TSC2. 75% of cases are sporadic. Most patients with TS have epilepsy. Infantile spasms are a frequent early manifestation of TS. Schizencephaly (cleft brain) has a wide anatomo-clinical spectrum, including focal epilepsy in most patients. Familial occurrence is rare. Heterozygous mutations in the EMX2 gene have been reported in some patients. However, at present, there is no clear indication on the possible pattern of inheritance and on the practical usefulness that mutation detection in an individual with schizencephaly would carry in terms of genetic counselling. Amongst several syndromes featuring polymicrogyria, bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria had familial occurrence on several occasions. Genetic heterogeneity is likely, including autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive inheritance and association to 22q11.2 deletions. FISH analysis for 22q11.2 is advisable in all patients with perisylvian polymicrogyria. Parents of an affected child with normal karyotype should be given up to a 25% recurrence risk.</text></passage></document><document><id>442</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)-associated amyloidosis in childhood. Clinical features, course and outcome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>111</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder of childhood characterized by attacks of fever and serositis. Renal amyloidosis is the most important complication of the disease that determines the prognosis. METHODS: Forty-eight Turkish FMF patients with amyloidosis who have been followed at the two hospitals in Ankara were included in this study. RESULTS: All patients with amyloidosis had been symptomatic for FMF at the time of the diagnosis (Phenotype I), none had received regular colchicine therapy and all presented with proteinuria. Ten of them had asymptomatic proteinuria; 38 had nephrotic syndrome and 8 of them had renal insufficiency (CRI) as well, at the time of the diagnosis. Regular colchicine therapy was commenced to all of the patients. At the end of observation period of 4.5 +/- 2.23 years (range 2-12 yrs) on treatment, nephrotic syndrome resolved in 13 patients and proteinuria was lost in 5 of them. None but 2 of the patients who were diagnosed at proteinuric stage progressed to end stage renal failure (ESRF). Seven MEFV mutations (M694V, M680I, V726A, M694I, K695R, R761H, E148Q) were systematically investigated in 32 patients. Six of the seven studied mutations were found in these patients and clinical diagnosis was confirmed by mutation analysis in 24 patients. Eight patients were found to have mutations on one of the alleles. CONCLUSION: Amyloidosis is the most serious complication of FMF. Colchicine treatment ameliorates the progression of renal disease in the patients who presented with proteinuria and even with nephrotic syndrome. No correlation between the outcome of the patients with nephrotic syndrome and the degree of proteinuria and/or serum albumin levels at the initiation of treatment were noted. Progression to ESRF seems inevitable despite colchicine therapy after the development of CRI in patients with FMF associated amyloidosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>443</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Inflammatory eye, skin, and bowel disease in spondyloarthritis: genetic, phenotypic, and environmental factors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To explore the nature of the interrelationship between inflammatory disease of the spine/joints, skin, eye, and bowel [i.e., ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis, iritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)]. METHODS: The study used 4 approaches: (1) analysis of the prevalence of secondary disorders within the AS individual (chi-square and matched pair analysis); (2) study of the temporal relationship between the onset of the different conditions; (3) evaluation of the prevalence of disease among first degree relatives; and (4) influence of secondary disorders on outcome of AS. RESULTS: 1. Among 3287 patients with AS, more than expected had either spondylitis associated with multiple co-disorders or pure AS (with no co-diseases); fewer than expected had AS plus a single co-disease (chi-square = 32.2, p &lt; 0.001). In a matched pair analysis, patients with AS and a secondary disorder were more likely to have an additional concomitant disease, e.g., IBD-AS (n = 335) patients had a higher prevalence of iritis [45.4% vs 36.7%; OR 1.4 (1.1-2.0)] or psoriasis [23.9% vs 14.3%; OR 1.9 (1.3-2.8)] than controls. 2. Among our database subjects, the symptomatic onset of the spinal disease precedes or is contemporaneous with gut, skin, and eye involvement (matched pair t test, p &lt; 0.001). 3. Patients with multiple disorders predict the highest prevalence of co-diseases (i.e., psoriasis, IBD, iritis, or AS) within family members, followed by those AS patients with only IBD, psoriasis, or iritis in descending order. 4. Both psoriasis and IBD increase severity in terrms of function and disease activity of AS in the patient. Radiological change is greatest for those AS subjects with iritis. CONCLUSION: There is a striking overlap within patients and family members of rheumatological, dermatological, and gastroenterological diseases. The susceptibility genes of these co-disorders appear to overlap with each other and with AS: 1. A patient with 2 inflammatory conditions is at an increased risk of developing an additional related inflammatory disorder. 2. Those with enteropathic spondylarthritis would appear to carry the greatest genetic load in terms of first degree relatives developing inflammatory conditions (including psoriasis and iritis that are not seen in the index IBD-AS patient). 3. The secondary disorders do not precede AS (arguing against psoriasis and IBD allowing for an environmental conduit to pathogenic triggers in AS). The susceptibility factors for these inflammatory conditions may be additive or have a synergistic effect on each other. There is evidence for a shared gene hypothesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>444</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Complete genomic sequence and analysis of 117 kb of human DNA containing the gene BRCA1. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>Over 100 distinct disease-associated mutations have been identified in the breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 .

We have found that the microfilament poison cytochalasin D blocks Fas-mediated apoptosis induced by Jo2 but not FasL in A20 cells. The induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis by Jo2 was antagonized by anti-Fcgamma RII/RIII receptor (FcgammaR) antibody, and defective in FcgammaR-negative A20 cells. Since the induction of Jo2-mediated apoptosis in FcgammaR-negative A20 cells was reversed by the addition of wild type A20 cells or the cross-linking agent protein A, Fas-expressing bystander A20 cells seem to be killed by other A20 cells that capture and cross-link monomeric Jo2 via FcgammaR. Although cytochalasin D affected FcgammaR-mediated cross-linking of Jo2 molecules, the drug markedly inhibited the intracellular signaling pathway induced by Jo2. The blockade of Jo2-induced apoptosis by cytochalasin D occurred upstream of caspase-8 activation. Thus, these observations suggest that actin cytoskeleton is required for early apoptosis signaling induced by Jo2, but not physiological FasL.</text></passage></document><document><id>447</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Neoplastic T cells in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma express CD10.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>71</offset><text>Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a systemic disease involving lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. Although the histologic features have been well described, the diagnosis is often challenging, as there are no specific phenotypic or molecular markers available. This study shows that the neoplastic cells of AITL can be identified by aberrant CD10 expression. Archival material from 30 cases of AITL, 10 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (PTL), and 10 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia were reviewed. Single and double immunostaining for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD21, CD10, BCL6, Ki67, and LMP-1 in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr early region and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for T-cell receptor gamma chain gene and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene were performed. Three overlapping histologic patterns with hyperplastic follicles, depleted follicles, or without follicles were identified in AITL. Of the 30 cases of AITL, 27 contained CD10(+) T cells. No CD10(+) T cells were present in the cases of PTL or reactive hyperplasia. PCR confirmed a monoclonal or oligoclonal T-cell population in 29 of 30 cases of AITL and a monoclonal B-cell population in 6 cases. Analysis of microdissected CD10(+) single cells showed that they belonged to the neoplastic clone. In conclusion CD10 is a phenotypic marker that specifically identifies the tumor cells in 90% of AITL, including the early cases. The presence of these cells distinguishes AITL from other PTLs. This finding provides an objective criterion for accurate and early diagnosis of AITL.</text></passage></document><document><id>448</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Platelet glycoprotein complex Ia/IIa antibodies cause neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia but do not inhibit megakaryopoiesis and platelet recovery after allogeneic cord blood stem cell transplantation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>204</offset><text>A sibling cord blood (CB) transplantation was performed in a boy with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

We now report that the expression of truncated or mutant full-length BRCA1 genes can abrogate certain phenotypic characteristics and/or confer the opposite phenotype to the wild-type BRCA1 gene. In particular, several carboxyl-terminal truncated BRCA1 proteins conferred chemoresistance, decreased susceptibility to apoptosis, and decreased ability to suppress in vivo tumor growth. These truncated BRCA1 proteins also blocked the ability of ectopically expressed wtBRCA1 to induce chemosensitivity and to inhibit estrogen receptor transcriptional activity. Studies using epitope-tagged truncated proteins confirmed their expression, nuclear localization, and functionality. On the other hand, in cells with no endogenous wild-type BRCA1 (HCC1937 human breast cancer cells), the wtBRCA1 gene enhanced cellular DNA repair activity and rendered the cells resistant to DNA damage; while truncated BRCA1 proteins blocked the wtBRCA1-induced chemoresistance. Our findings suggest that truncated BRCA1 proteins can inhibit the function of wild-type BRCA1. They raise the possibility that some inherited BRCA1 mutations may actively promote oncogenesis by blocking the function of the remaining wild-type BRCA1 allele, although this hypothesis remains to be proved.</text></passage></document><document><id>450</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel mutation W252X in the WAS gene in a Korean patient with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent infection, eczema, and microthrombocytopenia.

In a comprehensive study, the entire coding sequences of the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 were analyzed in 989 unrelated patients from German breast/ovarian cancer families. A total of 77 BRCA1 and 63 BRCA2 distinct deleterious mutations were found in 302 patients. More than (1/3) of these mutations are novel and might be specific for the German population. Eighteen common mutations were found in 68% of cases in BRCA1 and 13 recurrent mutations in 44% of cases in BRCA2, facilitating prescreening approaches. Haplotype analysis indicate that 14 out of 20 recurrent mutations are likely originating from a common founder. An additional 50 different rare sequence variants with unknown relevance for tumorigenesis were found in 72 families. Correlation of BRCA1/BRCA2 detection rates with family history identified families with both breast and ovarian cancer to be at highest risk for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations (43% and 10%, respectively), followed by families with at least 2 premenopausal cases of breast cancer (24% BRCA1 and 13% BRCA2 mutations). These data provide strong evidence for further predisposing genes in the German population. In breast cancer families with 2 or 3 affected females but only a single or no premenopausal case, mutations were detected with low frequencies (about 10% or less for both genes). The decision for or against molecular diagnosis is now aided by considering the expected mutation detection rates that greatly depend on family history and structure.</text></passage></document><document><id>452</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Are multiple pilomatricomas rare?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>34</offset></passage></document><document><id>453</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An intronic mutation in a lariat branchpoint sequence is a direct cause of an inherited human disorder (fish-eye disease). </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>The first step in the splicing of an intron from nuclear precursors of mRNA results in the formation of a lariat structure .

This study examined the two genes known to cause Rieger syndrome, PITX2 and FOXC1, for mutations in five Brazilian families with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. METHODS: Five families with a total of 23 persons affected by Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome were recruited for this study. A sequencing-based mutation screen was undertaken for the PITX2 and FOXC1 genes. Linkage analysis was used to study one large family for which no mutations were detected in the PITX2 or FOXC1 genes. RESULTS: Two of the five families harbored mutations in the PITX2 gene, but none of the families had a detectable FOXC1 mutation. Haplotypic analysis of three Rieger syndrome regions in a large family with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome excluded linkage to the 4q25 (PITX2), 6p25 (FOXC1), and 13q14 (RIEG2) regions. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the PITX2 gene is responsible for a significant portion of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome in the Brazilian population. Furthermore, there is also evidence for the presence of genetic heterogeneity of the disorder within the Brazilian population. Finally, a large family with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome has been identified that does not appear to harbor any of the three known loci. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome gene segregation in this family likely represents a novel locus.</text></passage></document><document><id>455</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Successful allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Patients: first report in Thailand.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>129</offset><text>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked recessive disorder, is characterized by primary progressive T cell immunodeficiency, impaired antipolysaccharide antibody production, eczema, and thrombocytopenia. Stem cell transplantation is the only curative therapy. To evaluate the use of allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in this group of patients, we performed allogeneic PBSCT in two WAS patients (3 and 12 years old). The conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan 4 mg/kg/day for 4 days, and cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day for 4 days. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis was consistent with cyclosporin A and methotrexate. Peripheral blood stem cells were collected from their brother donors (6 and 16 years old) by continuous flow leukapheresis after mobilization with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor at a dose of 7.5 microg/kg/day for 5 days. Both recipients achieved neutrophils engraftment on days 11 and 12. The first patient achieved platelets engraftment on day 30. The second patient did not have platelet count below 20.0 x 10(9)/l during PBSCT procedure. Both did not develop acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. At present, they are healthy after PBSCT. The follow up time after transplantation is 1,170 days and 269 days, respectively. Allogeneic PBSCT is economically feasible for WAS. The cost of PBSCT in Thailand is 20 to 30% less than bone marrow and cord blood stem cell transplantation. The cost of the transplant procedure for each patient in Thailand is US   12,000.

Sequencing of GPIIIa complementary DNA from an Oe(a) (+) individual showed deletion of a lysine residue at position 611 (DeltaLys(611)). Analysis of 20 Oe(a) (-) and 3 Oe(a) (+) individuals showed that the DeltaLys(611) form of GPIIIa was related to the phenotype. Anti-Oe(a) reacted with the DeltaLys(611), but not with the wild-type isoforms on stable transfectants expressing GPIIIa, indicating that DeltaLys(611) directly induces the expression of Oe(a) epitopes. Under nonreducing conditions the Pro(33)DeltaLys(611) variant migrated with a slightly decreased molecular weight compared to the Pro(33)Lys(611) isoform suggesting that DeltaLys(611) has an influence on the disulfide bonds of GPIIIa. The Pro(33)DeltaLys(611) GPIIIa could undergo conformational changes and bind to fibrinogen in a similar manner as the Pro(33)Lys(611) isoform. No difference was found in the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125(FAK), suggesting that DeltaLys(611) has no effect on integrin function. In contrast to all other low-frequency antigens, the DeltaLys(611) isoform was associated with the HPA-1b, but not with the high frequency HPA-1a allele. Comparison with GPIIIa DNA from nonhuman primates indicated that the HPA-1a allele represents the ancestral form of GPIIIa. It can be assumed that the Oe(a) form did arise as a result of a mutational event from an already mutated GPIIIa allele.</text></passage></document><document><id>457</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An animal model for Norrie disease (ND): gene targeting of the mouse ND gene. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>In order to elucidate the cellular and molecular processes which are involved in Norrie disease ( ND ) , we have used gene targeting technology to generate ND mutant mice .

By analysing tumour DNA from patients with sporadic T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia ( T-PLL ) , a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature T-cell leukaemia seen in A-T , we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T-PLL . In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A-T , the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations . These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain , which is highly conserved in ATM-related proteins in mouse , yeast and Drosophila . The resulting amino-acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition . Two of seventeen mutated T-PLL samples had a previously reported A-T allele . In contrast , no mutations were detected in the p53 gene , suggesting that this tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia . Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour DNA from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas ( B-NHL ) and a B-NHL cell line . The evidence of a significant proportion of loss-of-function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic T-PLL and suggests that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor .

Our findings thus suggest that Pro626 in SHBG-like domain 7 may be crucial for in vivo antithrombotic activity of the PS molecule.</text></passage></document><document><id>461</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA or Rho kinase activities are required for neurite outgrowth induced by the Netrin-1 receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>188</offset><text>Netrins are chemotropic guidance cues that attract or repel growing axons during development. DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), a transmembrane protein that is a receptor for netrin-1, is implicated in mediating both responses. However, the mechanism by which this is achieved remains unclear. Here we report that Rho GTPases are required for embryonic spinal commissural axon outgrowth induced by netrin-1. Using N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, we found that both Rac1 and Cdc42 activities are required for DCC-induced neurite outgrowth. In contrast, down-regulation of RhoA and its effector Rho kinase stimulates the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, DCC was found to trigger actin reorganization through activation of Rac1 but not Cdc42 or RhoA. We detected that stimulation of DCC receptors with netrin-1 resulted in a 4-fold increase in Rac1 activation. These results implicate the small GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA as essential components that participate in signaling the response of axons to netrin-1 during neural development.</text></passage></document><document><id>462</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Premutation and intermediate-size FMR1 alleles in 10572 males from the general population: loss of an AGG interruption is a late event in the generation of fragile X syndrome alleles.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>184</offset><text>We previously reported a 1:259 prevalence of female carriers of FMR1 premutation-size alleles (greater than 54 triplet repeats) in the general population. We now have screened 10 572 independent males from the same population for similar alleles using high-throughput Southern blotting. We identified 13 male carriers of an allele with more than 54 repeats. This corresponds to a prevalence of 1:813 males (95% confidence interval 1:527 to 1:1781). Haplotype analysis of four markers flanking the triplet array revealed that the prevalence of the major fragile X mutation-associated haplotype was increased among FMR1 alleles of 40-54 repeats. Although sequencing of highly unstable premutation alleles from fragile X families revealed only pure CGG tracts, this was not the case for alleles of similar size that were identified in males from the general population. Forty-eight out of forty-nine alleles of 40 or more triplets had one or two AGG interruptions. This observation, combined with the observation of the enrichment of major fragile X syndrome haplotypes in all alleles of this size, is evidence that the loss of an AGG interruption in the triplet repeat array is not necessary for expansion of normal alleles of 29-30 triplets to intermediate size. The loss of AGG interruptions thus appears to be a late event that leads to greatly increased instability and may be related to the haplotype background of specific FMR1 alleles.</text></passage></document><document><id>463</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Loss of BRCA1 expression in sporadic male breast carcinoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>BRCA1 protein is normally expressed in the nuclei of breast epithelial cells and functions as a negative regulator of the cell cycle. Mutations of BRCA1 gene have been associated with familial breast carcinomas. Although somatic mutations have not been demonstrated in sporadic breast carcinomas, loss of nuclear expression of BRCA1 protein has been correlated with high-grade, infiltrating breast carcinomas in females. We have investigated the expression of BRCA1 protein in a series of 26 infiltrating carcinomas of male breast and correlated the results with a variety of clinicopathological parameters. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated decreased expression of BRCA1 in all carcinomas compared to normal breast epithelium. The median survival was 8 years in patients with minimal loss of BRCA1 expression while it was 1.5 years in patients with marked loss of this protein. Marked loss of BRCA1 protein was also associated with increased cell proliferation. These results suggest that BRCA1 plays a similar role in both male and female breast carcinoma and Joss of this protein is associated with poor prognosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>464</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Resting metabolic rate, plasma leptin concentrations, leptin receptor expression, and adipose tissue measured by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging in women with Prader-Willi syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>188</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Obesity in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) may be related to abnormalities in the adipocyte-leptin-hypothalamic pathway and may be exacerbated by reductions in the resting metabolic rate (RMR). OBJECTIVE: We compared body composition, body-composition- adjusted RMR, and adiposity-adjusted plasma leptin between women with PWS and control women. We also examined leptin receptor expression in the PWS group. DESIGN: We studied body composition using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging and measured plasma leptin by radioimmunoassay in 45 control women aged 18-56 y and in 13 women with PWS aged 20-38 y. RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry in 41 control women and in 8 women with PWS. Age, body composition, and regional adipose tissue (AT) depots were corrected for by multiple regression analysis. Messenger RNA expression of the leptin receptor was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in lymphocytes. RESULTS: In the PWS group, fat mass was greater after correction for fat-free mass, and RMR was normal after correction for both fat-free mass and fat mass. Leptin was influenced primarily by subcutaneous AT volume in both subject groups. Leptin concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups after adjustment for age and AT content or distribution. Full-length leptin receptor messenger RNA was expressed in the lymphocytes of the PWS group. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in RMR in women with PWS are explained by abnormal body composition, suggesting that energy expenditure is normal at the tissue level in PWS. There is no evidence that defective leptin production causes obesity in PWS, and leptin receptor deficiency is not a primary consequence of the gene defects leading to leptin resistance.</text></passage></document><document><id>465</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel common missense mutation G301C in the N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase gene in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA ( MPS IVA ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a genetic defect in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase ( GALNS ) .

In response to ionizing radiation (IR), ATM, the gene product mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, stabilizes and activates p53 through phosphorylation of Ser(15) and (indirectly) Ser(20). Here we show that phosphorylation of p53 on Ser(46), a residue important for p53 apoptotic activity, as well as on Ser(9), in response to IR also is dependent on the ATM protein kinase. IR-induced phosphorylation at Ser(46) was inhibited by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, but not PD169316, a p38 MAPK inhibitor. p53 C-terminal acetylation at Lys(320) and Lys(382), which may stabilize p53 and activate sequence-specific DNA binding, required Ser(15) phosphorylation by ATM and was enhanced by phosphorylation at nearby residues including Ser(6), Ser(9), and Thr(18). These observations, together with the proposed role of Ser(46) phosphorylation in mediating apoptosis, suggest that ATM is involved in the initiation of p53-dependent apoptosis after IR in human lymphoblastoid cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>467</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The E326K mutation and Gaucher disease: mutation or polymorphism?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in the gene for human glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the intracellular hydrolysis of glucosylceramide. While over 150 different glucocerebrosidase mutations have been identified in patients with Gaucher disease, not all reported mutations have been fully characterized as being causative. One such mutation is the E326K mutation, which results from a G to A nucleotide substitution at genomic position 6195 and has been identified in patients with type 1, type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease. However, in each instance, the E326K mutation was found on the same allele with another glucocerebrosidase mutation. Utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening and restriction digestions of both patients with Gaucher disease and normal controls, we identified the E326K allele in both groups. Of the 310 alleles screened from patients with Gaucher disease, the E326K mutation was detected in four alleles (1.3%). In addition, screening for the E326K mutation among normal controls from a random population revealed that three alleles among 316 screened (0.9%) also carried the E326K mutation. In the normal controls with the E326K allele, the glucocerebrosidase gene was completely sequenced, but no additional mutations were found. Because the E326K mutation may be a polymorphism, we caution that a careful examination of any allele with this mutation should be performed to check for the presence of other glucocerebrosidase mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>468</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Demonstration of altered splicing with the IVS3-1G --> a mutation of cathepsin C.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset><text>Papillon-Lef  vre syndrome is an autosomal recessive palmoplantar keratoderma caused by cathepsin C gene mutations.

Among 107 autologous SCT, four patients (3.7%) were G6PD deficient. All subjects were male, except for two female patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The incidence of G6PD deficiency in female CML patients was significantly higher than the background female incidence (P = 0.004), but comparable with that in the males (P = 0.664). There was no significant hemolysis or delay in red cell engraftment, and all but one patient converted to donor G6PD screening status. One female patient achieved partial correction of her G6PD status and relapsed at 10 months.

Intragenic mutation of the VHL gene was found exclusively in clear-cell or variant-type RCCs at a frequency of 51% (104/202). Hypermethylation of the VHL promoter region was detected in an additional 11 clear-cell RCCs. Microsatellite analysis demonstrated that LOH of the VHL locus was found in 140/155 (90%) informative clear-cell RCCs. The VHL gene therefore seems to be inactivated in a two-hit manner by intragenic mutation or hypermethylation plus allelic loss in clear-cell RCC. Genomic rearrangement of the VHL gene detected by Southern analysis was not found (0/216 cases); this is in contrast to germ lines in which Southern aberrations consisted of 7-19% of the mutations. Clinicopathologic data demonstrated that VHL mutation/LOH did not vary according to tumor progression in clear-cell RCC, including tumor diameter, stage, grading, distant metastasis, and lymph node metastasis. Interestingly, VHL mutation was significantly less frequent in RCCs occurring in younger (&lt; or = 55 years) than that in older (> or = 56 years) patients. These data suggested that the inactivation of the VHL tumor-suppressor gene is a specific genetic change in clear-cell RCC, and that it may occur at an early or first step in the clear-cell tumorigenic pathway rather than as a late event.</text></passage></document><document><id>472</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Congenital chloride diarrhea gene error in the anion transporter protein].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset></passage></document><document><id>473</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of the mtTFA gene and identification of a processed pseudogene in rat.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>Mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription are regulated from essential nucleus-encoded components that interact with the mitochondrial (mt) D-loop region.

Previous methods of mutation detection were biased toward the detection of truncating mutations, and single nucleotide substitutions were likely to have been underreported. In this study, genomic DNA from 43 breast cancer patients and 43 control individuals were scanned for mutations in the entire ATM coding region (exons 4-65) and adjacent intronic splice regions (three megabases total) using detection of virtually all mutation-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), a modification of SSCP with sufficient redundancy to detect virtually all mutations. Excluding a polymorphism found commonly in cases and controls, there were missense changes in 12 breast cancer patients, one of whom also had a protein truncating mutation, versus six controls (P=0.09). When all structural changes common to the cases and controls were excluded, missense or truncating changes were found in 10 cases compared to two in controls (P=0.013). The background of missense changes in controls is high. There is a trend towards elevation of all structural changes in cases, but the results are not statistically significant. Cohort-specific structural changes are significantly more prevalent in the breast cancer patients. The data are compatible with certain missense mutations in ATM predisposing to breast cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>477</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset></passage></document><document><id>478</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A gene encoding a transmembrane protein is mutated in patients with diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy (Wolfram syndrome). </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>Wolfram syndrome ( WFS ; OMIM 222300 ) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder defined by young-onset non-immune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy .

Markers on chromosome 1 revealed a 3.07 multipoint LOD score between 1p36.1-p35, an 18-cM interval. Surprisingly, we also found linkage to 13q22-q32, a 14-cM interval, with a 3.08 LOD score.

Elucidation of ARH, the LDL receptor adaptor protein at chromosome 1p35, caused us to sequence that gene.

This study was performed to identify novel PAX6 mutations that lead to familial aniridia in Indian patients. METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from affected individuals (clinically diagnosed aniridia) from nine unrelated aniridic pedigrees, unaffected family members, and unrelated normal controls. The coding regions of PAX6 were amplified and subjected to single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) gel analysis, and direct cloning and sequencing. RESULTS: SSCP band shifts, indicative of DNA base pair mutations, were observed in five of these unrelated families. Four mutations were shown to be previously unreported insertion or deletions in PAX6, leading to frameshifts. These new mutations were c.1174delTG (in exon 10), c.710delC (exon 6), c.406delTT (exon 5) and c.393insTCAGC (exon 5). The other nonsense mutation, a transition (c.1080C>T) in exon 9, has been reported previously as a mutation hotspot for PAX6 in other ethnic pedigrees. All mutant alleles transmitted through aniridic individuals in each family. CONCLUSION: These new deletions and an insertion create frameshifts, which are predicted to introduce premature termination codons into the PAX6 reading frame. The genetic alterations carried by affected individuals are predicted to lead to loss-of-function mutations that would segregate in an autosomal dominant manner to subsequent generations. This is the first report of the 'hotspot' c.1080C>T transition from Indian families.</text></passage></document><document><id>482</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Rapid communication: sequencing of the porcine agouti-related protein (AGRP) gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset></passage></document><document><id>483</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>MHC class I chain-related gene a alleles distinguish malnutrition-modulated diabetes, insulin-dependent diabetes, and non-insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus patients from eastern India.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>188</offset><text>Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a polygenic disorder with an autoimmune basis for disease development. In addition to HLA, a second susceptibility locus for IDDM has been identified to lie in the major histocompatibility class III region. MIC-A is located in the MHC class III region and is expressed by monocytes, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells. Sequence determination of the MIC-A gene identifies trinucleotide repeat (GCT) microsatellite polymorphism in exon 5. Five alleles with 4, 5, 6, and 9 repetitions of GCT or 5 repetitions of GCT with 1 additional nucleotide insertion (GGCT) are identified. The alleles are A4, A5, A5.1, A6, and A9. The aim of our study was to find the association of MIC-A alleles with IDDM, malnutrition-modulated diabetes mellitus (MMDM), and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. IDDM (n = 52), MMDM (n = 41), NIDDM (n = 212), and healthy controls (n = 73) from Cuttack, in eastern India, were studied. Of the 212 NIDDM patients analyzed, 96 of them were found to be positive for either GAD65 or IA-2 antibodies. Autoantibodies to GAD65 and IA-2 were measured by radioligand binding assay using (35)S-labeled recombinant human GAD65 and IA-2 in an in vitro transcription/translation system. Autoantibody-positive NIDDM patients (n = 96) and adult healthy controls for NIDDM (n = 113) were also compared. These autoantibody-positive NIDDM patients are considered as slow-onset IDDM or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) patients. The samples were analyzed for MIC-A by PCR amplification, and fragment sizes were determined in an ABI prism DNA sequencer. The results of the MIC-A typing are: allele 9 of MIC-A is positively associated (OR 3.62; P &lt; 0.001), and allele 4 is negatively associated (OR 0.31; P &lt; 0.05) with MMDM patients compared to controls. Allele 5 is positively associated with IDDM (OR 2.64; P &lt; 0.05) when compared to controls. Allele 5.1 is positively associated in the autoantibody-positive NIDDM patients compared to adult controls. Our findings of a significant increase of allele A9 in MMDM patients compared to healthy controls suggest that MMDM is immunogenetically different from IDDM in eastern India. MIC-A is important in the pathogenesis of MMDM patients from Cuttack. MIC-A alleles distinguish acute-onset IDDM from slow-onset IDDM, indicating that this molecule may be important for delaying the onset of IDDM with the result that these patients are diagnosed clinically as NIDDM.</text></passage></document><document><id>484</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation of the VHL gene is associated exclusively with the development of non-papillary renal cell carcinomas. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>To define the possible role of the VHL gene in the development of sporadic renal cell carcinomas , 91 different parenchymal tumours of the kidney have been investigated for mutation of the VHL gene by single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) and / or heteroduplex ( HD ) techniques .

We studied whether the severity of cardiac involvement in myotonic dystrophy correlates with the severity of the genetic abnormality cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeat expansion. METHODS AND RESULTS: History, physical examination, ECG evaluation, and genetic testing were performed in patients with a clinical diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy. In 342 of 385 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by CTG repeat expansion. In these patients, the muscular disability severity correlated with age and CTG repeat length (r = 0.44, P &lt; 0.001). An arrhythmia diagnosis was present in 19 (5.6%) patients with a likelihood of diagnosis correlating with age (relative risk [RR] 2.2 per decade, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.4 to 3.4, P = 0.001) and CTG repeat length (RR 2.9 per 500 repeats, 95% CI 1.5 to 5.4, P = 0.001). ECGs were abnormal in 222 (64.9%) of the patients. Age, CTG repeat length, and male gender were factors found to correlate with ECG conduction abnormalities quantitated by the PR interval (r = 0.43, P &lt; 0.001) and QRS duration (r = 0.32, P &lt; 0.001). A 24-hour ambulatory ECG was abnormal in 95 (29.6%) of 321 recordings. The presence of an abnormality correlated with age (RR 1.5 per decade, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9, P &lt; 0.001) and CTG repeat length (RR 1.6 per 500 repeats, 95% confidence intervals 1.1 to 2.2, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The severity of skeletal and cardiac myopathy in myotonic dystrophy correlates with age and CTG repeat length, suggesting a similar mechanism causing a time-dependent degenerative process.</text></passage></document><document><id>486</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>VHL-mediated hypoxia regulation of cyclin D1 in renal carcinoma cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>71</offset><text>Renal cell carcinoma is associated with mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Cell lines derived from these tumors cannot exit the cell cycle when deprived of growth factors, and the ability to exit the cell cycle can be restored by the reintroduction of wild-type protein VHL (pVHL). Here, we report that cyclin D1 is overexpressed and remains inappropriately high in during contact inhibition in pVHL-deficient cell lines. In addition, hypoxia increased the expression of cyclin D1 specifically in pVHL-negative cell lines into which pVHL expression was restored. Hypoxic-induction of cyclin D1 was not observed in other pVHL-positive cell lines. This suggests a model whereby in some kidney cell types, pVHL may regulate a proliferative response to hypoxia, whereas the loss of pVHL leads to constitutively elevated cyclin D1 and abnormal proliferation under normal growth conditions.</text></passage></document><document><id>487</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Van der Woude syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>24</offset><text>Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial syndrome with variable expression characterised by congenital pits and sinuses in the lower lip together with cleft lip, or palate, or both.

Previous studies indicated that proteolipid proteins (PLPs) with disease-associated mutations are misfolded and trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during transportation to the cell surface, which eventually leads to oligodendrocyte cell death in PMD. Here we report a PMD patient with a very mild phenotype carrying a novel mutation (485G-->T) in exon 4 of the PLP1 gene that causes a Trp(162)Leu substitution in the protein. We also investigated intracellular trafficking of this mutant PLP in COS-7 cells. Transiently transfected mutant PLP(W162L) fused to an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a short peptide tag was not carried to the plasma membrane. However, in contrast to previous studies, this mutant PLP was not retained in the ER, indicating an escape of the newly translated protein from the quality control machinery. We also found that the mutant PLP accumulated in the nuclear envelope (NE) in a time-dependent manner. This mutant PLP, with its distribution outside the ER and a very mild phenotype, supports the idea that accumulation of misfolded mutant protein in the ER causes the severe phenotype of PMD.</text></passage></document><document><id>490</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The large subunit of replication factor C interacts with the histone deacetylase, HDAC1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>Replication factor C (RFC) is a pentameric complex of five distinct subunits that functions as a clamp loader, facilitating the loading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA during replication and repair.

We now report that RFC (p140) associates with histone deacetylase activity and interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). This complex is functional and when targeted to promoters as a Gal4 fusion, RFC (p140) is a strong, deacetylase-dependent repressor of transcription.

A polymorphic site in the promoter region is associated with differences in 5-HTT gene expression. Studies suggest that the short allele of the 5-HTT promoter (5-HTTPR) site can adversely influence the antidepressant response to SSRIs, and is associated with anxiety-related traits, depression, and impulsive disorders such as alcohol abuse. Several studies do not replicate these findings; potential confounding factors include age, gender, and population stratification. Other 5-HTT polymorphisms also exist. For example, individuals with the short allele of a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism, located in the second intron, may have reduced responsiveness to SSRIs, and the STin2.12 allele at this site has been associated with bipolar disorder. Findings both supporting and inconsistent with these conclusions are reviewed. The clinical effects of the polymorphisms may be associated with effects on platelets, neural 5-HTT levels, and indices of serotonergic function.</text></passage></document><document><id>492</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kDa (TReP-132) enhances P450scc gene transcription through interaction with steroidogenic factor-1 in human adrenal cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>169</offset><text>The human P450scc gene is regulated by the tissue-specific orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), which plays a key role in several physiologic processes including steroid synthesis, adrenal and gonadal development, and sexual differentiation. Several studies have demonstrated the interaction of SF-1 with different proteins. However, it is clear that additional factors not yet identified are involved with SF-1 to regulate different target genes. Recently, it was demonstrated that a novel transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kDa (TReP-132) regulates expression of the human P450scc gene. The overexpression of TReP-132 in adrenal cells increases the production of pregnenolone, which is associated with the activation of P450scc gene expression. Considering the colocalization of TReP-132 and SF-1 in steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal and testis, and the presence of two putative LXXLL motifs in TReP-132 that can potentially interact with SF-1, the relationship between these two factors on the P450scc gene promoter was determined. The coexpression of SF-1 and TReP-132 in adrenal NCI-H295 cells cooperates to increase promoter activity. Pull-down experiments demonstrated the interaction between TReP-132 and SF-1, and this was further confirmed in intact cells by coimmunoprecipitation/Western blot and two-hybrid analyses. Deletions and mutations of the TReP-132 cDNA sequence demonstrate that SF-1 interaction requires the LXXLL motif found at the amino-terminal region of the protein. Also, the "proximal activation domain" and the "AF-2 hexamer" motif of SF-1 are involved in interaction with TReP-132. Consistent with previous studies showing interaction between CBP/p300 and SF-1 or TReP-132, the coexpression of these three proteins results in a synergistic effect on P450scc gene promoter activity. Taken together the results in this study identify a novel function of TReP-132 as a partner in a complex with SF-1 and CBP/p300 to regulate gene transcription involved in steroidogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>493</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome associated with severe humoral immunodeficiency and monoclonal gammopathy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>A boy of Caucasian origin with a new subtype of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is described.

Laboratory investigation disclosed impaired apoptosis in both B- and T-lymphocyte subsets and expanded populations of CD3+CD4-CD8- T lymphocytes. Furthermore, marked dysregulation of humoral immune responses with transient expansion of monoclonal B cells, corresponding monoclonal gammopathy, and the presence of autoantibodies was found. Functional and molecular analysis revealed that Fas protein expression was normal, a mutation in the Fas gene was not found. Moreover, transcription of the downstream effector caspase-10 was unremarkable. This patient is unique compared to previously described patients as severe humoral immunodeficiency and monoclonal gammopathy are usually not described in patients with ALPS. This case points out the important role of apoptosis in regulating the degree of humoral immune responses at a clonal level in humans and gives further evidence for the phenotypic diversity of ALPS.</text></passage></document><document><id>494</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A mutational hot spot in the KCNQ4 gene responsible for autosomal dominant hearing impairment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>95</offset><text>Several different mutations in the KCNQ4 K+ channel gene are responsible for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment (DFNA2).

Intragenic mutations of the TWIST gene within 7p21 have been identified as a cause of this disorder. There is phenotypic overlap with other craniosynostosis syndromes, and intragenic mutations in FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) have been demonstrated in the other conditions. Furthermore, complete gene deletions of TWIST have also been found in a significant proportion of patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. We investigated 11 patients clinically identified as having the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype and 4 patients with craniosynostosis but without a clear diagnosis. Of the patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype, four were found to carry the FGFR3 P250R mutation, three were found to be heterozygous for three different novel mutations in the coding region of TWIST, and two were found to have a deletion of one copy of the entire TWIST gene. Developmental delay was a distinguishing feature of the patients with deletions, compared to patients with intragenic mutations of TWIST, in agreement with the results of Johnson et al. [1998: Am J Hum Genet 63:1282-1293]. No mutations were found for the four patients with craniosynostosis without a clear diagnosis. Therefore, 9 of our 11 patients (82%) with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype had detectable genetic changes in FGFR3 or TWIST. We propose that initial screening for the FGFR3 P250R mutation, followed by sequencing of TWIST and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletion detection of TWIST, is sufficient to detect mutations in > 80% of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>496</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genomewide linkage disequilibrium mapping of severe bipolar disorder in a population isolate.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Genomewide association studies may offer the best promise for genetic mapping of complex traits.

Interestingly, only the -KTS form of WT1 is able to bind to and transactivate the Sf1 promoter. This observation is consistent with differential roles for the -KTS and +KTS variants of WT1 which have been postulated on the basis of human disorders such as the Frasier syndrome.

The aim of this study was to identify any genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2A13 gene, which may alter the metabolic capacities of the enzyme. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis was used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all of the exons and at the exon-intron boundaries, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing were used to determine the frequencies of the newly identified variant alleles in the four major ethnic groups. Blood spot DNA from more than 100 individuals was used for these analyses. Seven variant alleles were found, but only one SNP was detected in the coding region, in exon 5, leading to an Arg257Cys amino acid change. The frequencies of the Arg257Cys allele in white, black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals are 1.9%, 14.4%, 5.8%, and 7.7%, respectively. Functional analysis of the variant protein was performed following its heterologous expression. The Arg257Cys variant was 37 to 56% less active than the wild-type Arg-257 protein toward all substrates tested. With NNK, Cys-257 had higher K(m) and lower V(max) values than did Arg-257, with a >2-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency.

Genomic characterization of the C9orf19 gene identified five exons extending over 27.2 kb of genomic DNA, located 12 kb centromeric to the tumor suppressor RECK gene. C9orf19 mRNA is expressed in a wide range of adult tissues as a single transcript, most abundantly in lung and peripheral blood leukocytes. The predicted protein contains the SCP-like extracellular protein signature classified to IPR001283, a family of evolutionary related proteins with extracellular domains, which includes the human glioma pathogenesis-related protein (GliPR), the human testis specific glycoprotein (TPX-1), and several other extracellular proteins from rodents (SCP), insects venom allergens (Ag5, Ag3), plants pathogenesis proteins (PR-1) and yeast hypothetical proteins. Homology searches with the deduced 154 amino acid protein sequence of C9orf19 revealed highly similar proteins in mouse, drosophila, nematode and yeast. Mutation analysis of C9orf19 in IBM2 patients excluded it as the disease causing gene and revealed four single nucleotide polymorphisms within and in the vicinity of the gene, which will certainly be useful tools to study its potential role in several human diseases mapped to chromosome 9p12-p13.

We previously reported that flow cytometric analysis of intracellular WASP expression (FCM-WASP) was useful in the diagnosis of WAS in patients and carriers. In this study, we applied FCM-WASP to evaluate the mixed chimera (MC) status of 12 WAS patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HST). After HST, donor- and recipient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) could be distinguished easily with this method, since the donor cells were WASP(bright), whereas the defective recipient cells were WASP(dim). Furthermore, with use of 2-color FCM-WASP, the MC status could be characterized by cell lineage. Six of the 12 patients with WAS were found to have MC status after HST, whereas others had complete chimera status. MC status was observed in every cell lineage examined. However, among PBMCs, recipient cells were most commonly observed in the monocyte population. Finally, to investigate the naive/memory status of donor and recipient T cells in these patients, 3-color FCM-WASP using anti-CD45RA or CD45RO was performed. We found that, in contrast to WASP(bright) T cells, most WASP(dim) T cells remained naive (CD45RA(+)/RO(-)) more than a year after HST. No imbalance in the ratio of naive to memory T cells was observed in WAS patients before HST. We conclude that FCM-WASP is a potentially useful method for clinical follow-up of WAS patients who have undergone HST.

Some of these diseases are exclusive to megakaryocytes and platelets, while in others the pathology extends to other cell types. Although the defective genes, coding for membrane glyoproteins, cytoskeleton components and intracellular signaling pathways, as well as transcription factors, have been identified in most cases, the pathophysiology of these disorders is often unknown. This review describes recent contributions to clinical and diagnostic aspects, biology and treatments of familial thrombocytopenias. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The information presented here derives from literature and the experience of the authors. The most relevant studies are critically analyzed and discussed. STATE OF ART: The clinical and laboratory features of most of the inherited thrombocytopenias have been reviewed. The different forms have been classified into 3 groups depending on platelet volume. Although this criterion is not completely satisfactory, it is one of the most useful in diagnostic algorithms. We report on recent advances in Wiskott-Aldrich and Bernard-Soulier syndromes, as well as in MYH9-related diseases, a new nosological entity that groups old distinct forms known as May-Hegglin anomaly, Sebastian, Fetchner, and Epstein syndromes. Other, less frequent forms are also discussed, including non-syndromic forms of mild thrombocytopenia that are genetically heterogeneous. PERSPECTIVES: In the past, inherited thrombocytopenias were considered exceedingly rare and the number of well-defined forms was very small. In the last few years, the widespread diffusion of electronic cell counters has allowed these conditions to be detected more frequently and several new entities have been identified through the co-ordinated efforts of physicians, biologists and geneticists. The pathogenesis of many new and old forms is being unraveled, thus providing insights on the molecular basis of platelet production and function. This knowledge will be a valuable resource for clinicians in the diagnostic approaches to such disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>508</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Re-establishing peripheral tolerance in the absence of CTLA-4: complementation by wild-type T cells points to an indirect role for CTLA-4.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>139</offset><text>CTLA-4 plays an important role in the down-regulation of activated T cells and in the establishment of peripheral tolerance. It has been hypothesized that CTLA-4 on the cell surface signals directly into T cells during primary immune responses, resulting in intrinsic T cell down-regulation. It is not known, however, whether CTLA-4 directly inhibits the less intense activating signals received by autoreactive T cells in the periphery. We investigated whether CTLA-4 acts intrinsically upon self-reactive cells in vivo, or whether it inhibits autoreactive cells indirectly, in a non-cell autonomous manner. The adoptive transfer of CTLA-4-deficient splenocytes or Thy 1(+) cells into recombinase-activating gene 2-deficient mice resulted in fatal inflammation and tissue destruction similar to that seen in CTLA-4-deficient mice. When an equivalent number of splenocytes or Thy 1(+) cells from wild-type animals was transferred with the CTLA-4-deficient cells, recipient mice survived indefinitely. Since CTLA-4 was absent in the T cells responsible for the inflammatory phenotype, the down-regulation of these autoreactive cells must have been facilitated indirectly by wild-type Thy 1(+) cells. In addition, a rapid reduction in the ratio of CTLA-4-deficient to wild-type cells was observed. We propose two possible indirect mechanisms by which CTLA-4 may function in the establishment and maintenance of peripheral tolerance.</text></passage></document><document><id>509</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Germline mutations in the RB1 gene in patients with hereditary retinoblastoma. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>We have analyzed the 27 exons and the promoter region of the RB1 gene in familial or sporadic bilateral retinoblastoma by using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis .

A total of 62 patients with hyperlipidaemia, defined as total cholesterol levels above 220 mg/dl or triglyceride levels above 150 mg/dl, were recruited. Patients were divided into two groups: Group N received initial therapy with niceritrol 750-1500 mg/day, and those in Group P, pravastatin 10 mg/day. After 8 weeks, pravastatin 10 mg/day was added to the Group N treatment regimen for a further 8 weeks, while patients in Group P were given niceritrol 750-1500 mg/day in addition to pravastatin for 8 weeks. After the 8-week combination therapy study period, total cholesterol levels were 209.6 mg/dl in Group N and 220.7 mg/dl in Group P. Decreased triglyceride and lipoprotein(a) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, neither of which were achieved by pravastatin administration alone, were achieved with the combination of pravastatin and niceritrol. We conclude that when a single lipid-lowering drug fails to show therapeutic value, attempting combination therapy with a nicotinic acid preparation and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) is worthwhile.</text></passage></document><document><id>511</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor stabilizes novel plant homeodomain protein Jade-1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>The von Hippel-Lindau disease gene (VHL) is the causative gene for most adult renal cancers. However, the mechanism by which VHL protein functions as a renal tumor suppressor remains largely unknown. To identify low occupancy VHL protein partners with potential relevance to renal cancer, we screened a human kidney library against human VHL p30 using a yeast two-hybrid approach. Jade-1 (gene for Apoptosis and Differentiation in Epithelia) encodes a previously uncharacterized 64-kDa protein that interacts strongly with VHL protein and is most highly expressed in kidney. Jade-1 protein is short-lived and contains a candidate destabilizing (PEST) motif and plant homeodomains that are not required for the VHL interaction. Jade-1 is abundant in proximal tubule cells, which are clear-cell renal cancer precursors, and expression increases with differentiation. Jade-1 is expressed in cytoplasm and the nucleus diffusely and in speckles, where it partly colocalizes with VHL. VHL reintroduction into renal cancer cells increases endogenous Jade-1 protein abundance up to 10-fold. Furthermore, VHL increases Jade-1 protein half-life up to 3-fold. Thus, direct protein stabilization is identified as a new VHL function. Moreover, Jade-1 protein represents a novel candidate regulatory factor in VHL-mediated renal tumor suppression.</text></passage></document><document><id>512</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset><text>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a family of soft tissue tumors that are associated with the skeletal muscle lineage and generally occur in the pediatric population. Based on histopathologic features, two subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS), were identified and associated with distinct clinical characteristics and genetic alterations. ARMS is associated with 2;13 or 1;13 chromosomal translocations, which generate PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion products, respectively. These translocations result in altered expression, function, and subcellular localization of the fusion products relative to the wild-type proteins, and ultimately contribute to oncogenic behavior by modifying growth, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways. In contrast to the specific translocations found in ARMS, most ERMS cases have allelic loss at chromosome 11p15.5. Chromosome fragment transfer studies demonstrated that this region represses tumor cell growth, suggesting the presence of tumor suppressor gene(s) in this region. In both ERMS and ARMS, there is evidence of collaborating alterations that affect common targets, such as the p53 and RB pathways. One mechanism for perturbing these pathways involves amplification of genes such as MDM2 and CDK4; these amplification events occur frequently in ARMS but only rarely in ERMS. Therefore, despite similarities in the downstream targets of these genetic alterations, the striking cytogenetic and molecular differences between ARMS and ERMS indicate distinct molecular etiologies in these two subtypes.</text></passage></document><document><id>513</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Effect of iron status on DMT1 expression in duodenal enterocytes from beta2-microglobulin knockout mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>Divalent metal transporter I (DMT1) is thought to be involved in transport of iron across the apical cell membrane of villus duodenal cells. To determine its role in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), we used beta2-microglobulin knockout (B2M-/-) mice that accumulate iron as in HH. The B2M-/- and control C57BL/6 (B2M+/+) mice were fed diets with different iron contents. Increasing the iron availability increased plasma iron levels in both B2M+/+ and B2M-/- mice. Reducing the iron availability decreased the plasma iron concentration in B2M+/+ mice but was without effect on plasma iron in B2M-/- mice. DMT1 was not detectable in mice fed normal or iron-loaded diets when using immunohistochemistry. In Western blots, however, the protein was consistently observed regardless of the dietary regimen. DMT1 expression was increased to the same extent in B2M+/+ and B2M-/- mice when fed an iron-poor diet. In both strains of mice fed an iron-poor diet, DMT1 was evenly distributed in the differentiated enterocytes from the base to the tip of the villi but was absent from the crypts of Lieberk  hn. These data suggest that the observed effects were due to the state of iron deficiency in mucosal cells rather than genetic defect.</text></passage></document><document><id>514</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Proceedings: Thymus, acetylcholine receptor and myasthenia gravis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset></passage></document><document><id>515</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Three new cases of Alstr  m syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>38</offset><text>PURPOSE: To report three further cases of Alstr  m syndrome and to present a review of the literature. METHODS: Three siblings, two brothers and a sister, are described. They had complete ophthalmologic examination with retinography and fluoroscein angiography. They also underwent general and metabolic examination and genetic study. RESULTS: Alstr  m syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by atypical retinal pigmentary degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and chronic nephropathy. The diagnosis is based on clinical, biologic (hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinism), and genetic criteria (autosomal recessive disorder on chromosome 2). CONCLUSION: Blindness, hearing loss, complications of diabetes, and renal failure confirm the gravity of this syndrome. The prognosis regarding survival is correlated with the severity of renal failure.</text></passage></document><document><id>516</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Wilms' tumor 1 and Dax-1 modulate the orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 in sex-specific gene expression. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Products of steroidogenic factor 1 ( SF-1 ) and Wilms tumor 1 ( WT1 ) genes are essential for mammalian gonadogenesis prior to sexual differentiation .

It is caused by deficiency of frataxin, a highly conserved nuclear-encoded protein localized in mitochondria. The DNA abnormality found in 98% of Friedreich's ataxia chromosomes is the unstable hyperexpansion of a GAA triplet repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene. Most patients are homozygous for this repeat expansion. The expanded GAA repeat causes frataxin deficiency because it interferes with the transcription of the gene by adopting a non-B (probably triple helical) structure. Longer repeats cause a more profound frataxin deficiency and are associated with earlier onset and increased severity of the disease. Molecular testing has shown that the phenotypic spectrum of Friedreich's ataxia is wider than previously thought. Up to 10% of patients with recessive or sporadic degenerative ataxia who do not fulfill the Friedreich's ataxia diagnostic criteria are homozygous for expanded alleles at the Friedreich's ataxia locus. Late age of onset, retained tendon reflexes, and lack of pyramidal signs are among the atypical features observed in some patients with a positive molecular test. Yeast cells deficient in the frataxin homologue accumulate iron in mitochondria and show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. This suggests that Friedreich's ataxia is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and free radical toxicity, with consequent mitochondrial damage, axonal degeneration, and cell death.</text></passage></document><document><id>518</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Dual roles of ATM in the cellular response to radiation and in cell growth control. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) patients , denoted ATM , encodes a putative protein or lipid kinase .

To enable the use of DNA samples for the study of this polymorphism, we established a haptoglobin genotyping method based on PCR. METHODS: Taking advantage of the selectivity of PCR, we amplified DNA segments specifically representing haptoglobin alleles Hp 1 and Hp 2 from genomic DNA. The products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Haptoglobin phenotyping of plasma samples was performed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peroxidase staining. RESULTS: Exploiting the known size difference between Hp 1 and Hp 2, we amplified allele-specific DNA molecules with one pair of oligonucleotide primers. As an alternative, we used separate primer pairs to generate amplification products indicative of alleles Hp 1 and Hp 2. Because of the primer design, genotype determination was not compromised by sequence variations specifying haptoglobin allele subtypes S and F. For the same reason, the sequence similarity between the haptoglobin gene and the haptoglobin-related gene did not interfere with the accuracy of genotyping. Analysis with restriction enzymes demonstrated the authenticity of the allele-specific DNA products. Haptoglobin DNA genotyping and protein phenotyping, performed in parallel, yielded fully corresponding results. In a group of 249 individuals, the haptoglobin genotype distribution was as follows: 14.5% Hp 1-1, 48.2% Hp 2-1, and 37.3% Hp 2-2. CONCLUSION: The new method can be used for genotyping of a common haptoglobin polymorphism.</text></passage></document><document><id>520</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation analysis of the mel-18 gene that shows decreased expression in human breast cancer cell lines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Mammalian mel-18 is a member of the polycomb group, and it acts as a transcriptional repressor with DNA binding activity. Murine mel-18 negatively regulates the cell cycle through the c-myc/cdc25 cascade, and mice haploinsufficient for mel-18 develop mammary gland tumors. In addition, the human homolog of mel-18 is located at 17q, on which candidate tumor suppressor genes for breast cancer have been suggested for a long time. These observations indicate that the mel-18 gene may be a tumor suppressor gene for breast cancer. To investigate this possibility, we examined the expression of mel-18 mRNA in human breast cancer cell lines and searched for mel-18 gene mutations in sporadic and familial breast cancers. METHODS: The expression of mel-18 mRNA was examined in five breast cancer cell lines by RT-PCR, and somatic and germline mutations of the mel-18 gene were analyzed by the PCR-SSCP and sequence methods in 48 sporadic breast cancers, including 16 cases with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the mel-18 locus, and in 23 cases from 18 breast cancer families, respectively. RESULTS: We found that most cell lines examined here showed decreased expression of mel-18 mRNA, however, no alteration other than a single nucleotide change that did not lead to amino acid alteration in one patient was identified. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that mel-18 gene mutations are exceedingly rare in human breast cancers, and a reduction of mel-18 expression in human breast cancer cell lines would support a role for mel-18 haploinsufficiency in breast carcinogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>521</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a locus for a form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia on chromosome 15q26.1: exclusion of aggrecan as a candidate gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>135</offset><text>We have investigated a family with an autosomal dominant form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) characterised by short stature and severe premature degenerative arthropathy.

According to current linkage maps and sequence data, this locus includes that of the aggrecan gene (AGC1). Our linkage data from the SED family show, however, that AGC1 maps to a locus that is proximal to D15S979. This proximal location for AGC1 is further supported by linkage data from a second family with an autosomal recessive form of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia that also maps to the SED locus. In both families AGC1 is therefore excluded as a candidate gene.</text></passage></document><document><id>522</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in activated T cells abrogates TRAIL-induced apoptosis upstream of the mitochondrial amplification loop and caspase-8.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>200</offset><text>Fas ligand and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induce apoptosis in many different cell types. Jurkat T cells die rapidly by apoptosis after treatment with either ligand. We have previously shown that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) can act as a negative regulator of apoptosis mediated by the Fas receptor. In this study we examined whether MAPK/ERK can also act as a negative regulator of apoptosis induced by TRAIL. Activated Jurkat T cells were efficiently protected from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The protection was shown to be MAPK/ERK dependent and independent of protein synthesis. MAPK/ERK suppressed TRAIL-induced apoptosis upstream of the mitochondrial amplification loop because mitochondrial depolarization and release of cytochrome c were inhibited. Furthermore, caspase-8-mediated relocalization and activation of Bid, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl family, was also inhibited by the MAPK/ERK signaling. The protection occurred at the level of the apoptotic initiator caspase-8, as the cleavage of caspase-8 was inhibited but the assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex was unaffected. Both TRAIL and Fas ligand have been suggested to regulate the clonal size and persistence of different T cell populations. Our previous results indicate that MAPK/ERK protects recently activated T cells from Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis during the initial phase of an immune response before the activation-induced cell death takes place. The results of this study show clearly that MAPK/ERK also participates in the inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis after T cell activation.</text></passage></document><document><id>523</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The cystathionine beta-synthase variant c.844_845ins68 protects against CNS demyelination in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>The clinical course of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is of unexplained heterogeneity. Major X-ALD phenotypes are the progressive childhood cerebral form (CCALD) with early confluent cerebral demyelination and the adult-onset adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). Adult AMN may present with demyelinated foci of the CNS (adrenoleukomyeloneuropathy, ALMN) or without ("pure" AMN). Activated methionine is essential for CNS myelination, and methionine metabolism is important for glutathione synthesis, which may influence neurodegeneration. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a key enzyme of methionine metabolism. The CBS variant c.844_845ins68 (p.-) may influence the availability of activated methionine as well as of glutathione. In this study, we analyzed this variant in genomic DNA samples of 86 X-ALD patients. We observed the allele carrying the insertion in 12 of 49 patients without CNS demyelination ("pure" AMN), but in none of the 37 patients with CNS demyelination (CCALD or ALMN; chi(2)=10.531; p=0.001). We conclude that the insertion allele of CBS c.844_845ins68 protected X-ALD patients against CNS demyelination in our study sample. These data suggest that the individual conditions in methionine metabolism may be a disease modifier of X-ALD. Since methionine metabolism can easily be influenced by vitamin and amino acid substitution, this observation could be a basis of novel treatment strategies in this yet untreatable disease.

Most IRFs regulate the expression of interferon-alpha and -beta after viral infection, but the function of IRF6 is unknown. The gene encoding IRF6 is located in the critical region for the Van der Woude syndrome (VWS; OMIM 119300) locus at chromosome 1q32-q41 (refs 2,3). The disorder is an autosomal dominant form of cleft lip and palate with lip pits, and is the most common syndromic form of cleft lip or palate. Popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS; OMIM 119500) is a disorder with a similar orofacial phenotype that also includes skin and genital anomalies. Phenotypic overlap and linkage data suggest that these two disorders are allelic. We found a nonsense mutation in IRF6 in the affected twin of a pair of monozygotic twins who were discordant for VWS. Subsequently, we identified mutations in IRF6 in 45 additional unrelated families affected with VWS and distinct mutations in 13 families affected with PPS. Expression analyses showed high levels of Irf6 mRNA along the medial edge of the fusing palate, tooth buds, hair follicles, genitalia and skin. Our observations demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of IRF6 disrupts orofacial development and are consistent with dominant-negative mutations disturbing development of the skin and genitalia.</text></passage></document><document><id>525</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Difficulties in the ascertainment of C9 deficiency: lessons to be drawn from a compound heterozygote C9-deficient subject. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>A group of patients with long-surviving mismatched kidney allografts were investigated for complement function using haemolytic assays in agarose gels .

Excitable cells express multiple alpha subtypes, designated Na(v)1.1-Na(v)1.9, and three beta subunits, designated beta1, beta2 and beta3. Understanding how the different alpha subtypes, in combination with the various beta subunits, determine sodium channel behavior is important for elucidating the molecular basis of sodium channel functional diversity. In this study, we used whole-cell electrophysiological recording to examine the properties of the human Na(v)1.3 alpha subtype, stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and to investigate modulation of Na(v)1.3 function by beta1, beta2 and beta3 subunits. In the absence of beta subunits, human Na(v)1.3 formed channels that inactivated rapidly (tau(inactivation) approximately equals 0.5 ms at 0 mV) and almost completely by the end of 190-ms-long depolarizations. Using an intracellular solution with aspartate as the main anion, the midpoint for channel activation was approximately -12 mV. The midpoint for inactivation, determined using 100-ms conditioning pulses, was approximately -47 mV. The time constant for repriming of inactivated channels at -80 mV was approximately 6 ms. Coexpression of beta1 or beta3 did not affect inactivation time course or the voltage dependence of activation, but shifted the inactivation curve approximately 10 mV negative, and slowed the repriming rate ca. three-fold. beta2 did not affect channel properties, either by itself or in combination with beta1 or beta3. Na(v)1.3 expression is increased in damaged nociceptive peripheral afferents. This change in channel expression levels is correlated with the emergence of a rapidly inactivating and rapidly repriming sodium current, which has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. The results of this study support the hypothesis that Na(v)1.3 may mediate this fast sodium current.</text></passage></document><document><id>527</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The human complement C9 gene: identification of two mutations causing deficiency and revision of the gene structure. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>The ninth component of human complement ( C9 ) is the last of the terminal complement components creating the membrane attack complex .

It was recently identified as a tumour suppressor gene mutated in sporadic and hereditary Malignant Rhabdoid Tumours (MRT). However, the role of hSNF5/INI1 loss-of-function in tumour development is still unknown. Here, we show that the ectopic expression of wild-type hSNF5/INI1, but not that of truncated versions, leads to a cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the entry into S phase of MRT cells. This G1 arrest is associated with down-regulation of a subset of E2F targets including cyclin A, E2F1 and CDC6. This arrest can be reverted by coexpression of cyclin D1, cyclin E or viral E1A, whereas it cannot be counteracted by pRB-binding deficient E1A mutants. Moreover, hSNF5/INI1 is not able to arrest cells lacking a functional pRB. These observations suggest that the hSNF5/INI1-induced G1 arrest is dependent upon the presence of a functional pRB. However, the observation that a constitutively active pRB can efficiently arrest MRT cells indicates that hSNF5/INI1, at the difference of the ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, is dispensable for pRB function. Altogether, these data show that hSNF5/INI1 is a potent regulator of the entry into S phase, an effect that may account for its tumour suppressor role.</text></passage></document><document><id>529</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Rapid screening for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using dried blood specimens.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>We describe two reliable methods for high-throughput screening of proteinase inhibitor (PI) S and PI Z alpha(1)-antitrypsin (alpha(1)-AT) deficiency alleles from dried blood spot (DBS) specimens using the LightCycler fluorimetric analyzer. The method was used to study 72 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Results were confirmed with DNA sequencing. The alpha(1)-AT concentration in DBS was determined with immune nephelometry. Sixteen patients (22%) showed no PI Z or PI S mutations. Five patients (7%) had a heterozygous genotype consisting of a PI S allele and a normal allele for the Z and S positions (non-S non-Z). Twenty-five patients (35%) had a heterozygous genotype consisting of a PI Z and a non-S non-Z allele. Two (3%) had the PI SS genotype, 2 (3%) the PI SZ, and 20 (28%) the PI ZZ. All patients with two normal alpha(1)-AT alleles and 10 heterozygous carriers of one normal and one deficient allele had alpha(1)-AT levels that fell within the alpha(1)-AT DBS normal range (1.8-3.1 mg/dl). Two patients with the rare PI MM(malton)- and PI MM(heerlen)-deficient variants showed deficient alpha(1)-AT levels; PI S and PI Z were not detected. Processing 32 samples requires only 40 minutes. This single-step, cost-effective technology is optimal for working with small amounts of DNA, as are present in DBS. The method is suitable for large-scale screening, in cases where PI type is important.</text></passage></document><document><id>530</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene ( CYP27A1) in a Taiwanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset></passage></document><document><id>531</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A missense mutation encoding Cys73Phe in neurophysin II is associated with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (ADNDI) is an inherited disease caused by progressive deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) that typically becomes clinically apparent in the first decade of life. The genetic locus of ADNDI is the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene and mutations that cause ADNDI have been found in the nucleotides encoding the signal peptide, vasopressin, and neurophysin II peptides. In this study we have analyzed the AVP-NPII gene in a 20-year-old female who was diagnosed with ADNDI at 2 years of age. A heterozygous missense mutation (1684G>T) was found in exon 2 that predicts replacement of cysteine with phenylalanine at position 73 of neurophysin II. The mutation was confirmed by subcloning exon 2 PCR products to sequence each allele independently. Two out of four clones were found to have the missense mutation and two have the normal sequence, confirming the presence of the mutation and heterozygosity. Neurophysin II is an intracellular carrier protein for AVP during axonal transport from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary and contains 14 cysteine residues forming 7 disulfide bonds. This mutation is predicted to disrupt the disulfide bridge between Cys73 and Cys61 within the neurophysin II moiety. This finding of a novel mutation substituting cysteine with phenylalanine in one AVP-NPII gene allele supports the hypothesis that inability to form normal disulfide bonds in neurophysin II leads to ADNDI.</text></passage></document><document><id>532</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a polymorphic, neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>A variety of chromatin remodeling complexes are thought to assist sequence-specific transcription factors.

It is estimated that 25% of families meeting the criteria for hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma (HDCG) will have germline mutations in the E-cadherin gene. Evidence suggests that stomach cancer might also be a malignant manifestation of other inherited predispositions to disease. Recently, it has been reported that the incidence of stomach cancer is significantly increased in BRCA2 gene mutation carriers. We analysed by direct sequencing the BRCA2 gene in 29 breast cancer patients derived from 29 families with an aggregation of at least one female breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 50 years and one male stomach cancer diagnosed before the age of 55 years. In all but one of these families at least one additional relative was also affected by a malignant tumour. We identified three frameshift mutations and three sequence variants - potentially missense mutations, in six unrelated patients representing 20.7% (six out of 29) of the families investigated. Our results confirm that BRCA2 gene mutations are also associated with familial aggregations of not only breast but also of stomach cancer. In comparison to the number of cancers expected in the study population compared to the general population there is an over-representation of several cancers with significant confidence intervals to suggest that the associations are real and not a selection artefact.</text></passage></document><document><id>535</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Instability of a premutation-sized CGG repeat in FMR1 YAC transgenic mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>Fragile X syndrome results from the massive expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the gene FMR1.

Several transgenic lines were generated that carried repeats of varying lengths and amounts of flanking sequence. Length-dependent instability in the form of small expansions and contractions was observed in both male and female transmissions over five generations. No parent-of-origin effect or somatic instability was observed. Alterations in tract length were found to occur exclusively in the 3' uninterrupted CGG tract. Large expansion events indicative of a transition from a premutation to a full mutation were not observed.

A-T cells exhibit a greatly decreased survival and a reduction in DNA synthesis inhibition as well as p53 induction in response to ionizing radiation. Occasionally, some strains of A-T cells have been reported to manifest a slightly enhanced sensitivity with no consistent observations of a deficiency in either cell cycle control or the repair of DNA damage after treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light. In the present study it is shown that skin fibroblasts from four A-T patients, compared with the control, display enhanced sensitivity to the killing effect of UV-light, moderate radioresistant DNA synthesis, and a reduction in viral recovery in the host cell reactivation (HCR) assay. PCR based analysis indicated that three of these UV-sensitive A-T cell strains bear a large deletion in the ATM gene, and no ATM polypeptide was detected in their cell free extracts. Moreover, it is shown that, in non-replicative conditions, these A-T cells are less efficient than normal cells in repairing the T4 endonuclease V sensitive sites. These results constitute the first clear evidence showing the deficiency of A-T cells in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage, and provide further information on the relationship between cell cycle control and DNA repair in human cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>537</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical study and haplotype analysis in two brothers with Partington syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Partington et al.

After refinement, the PRTS locus was mapped to marker DXS989 (with maximum LOD score of 3.1) with flanking markers DXS365 and DXS28. Since then, no other patients with a similar phenotype have been described. We present a detailed description of the neurological symptoms and the disease history of two brothers with the clinical features of PRTS. Psychomotor development was delayed in both, and neurological features included mild to moderate mental retardation, dysarthria, facial muscle weakness, severe dysdiadochokinesis, slow dystonic movements, and mild spasticity of the hands, without ataxia or spasticity of the legs. The symptoms were nonprogressive and extrapyramidal, and without cerebellar involvement. In general, behavior of the two brothers was friendly and quiet, although the elder brother had periods of depressed mood and outbursts of anger. Karyotypes and subsequent investigation of the subtelomeres as well as DNA analysis of the FMR1 gene, the androgen receptor gene, and the DM locus did not reveal a genetic abnormality. Haplotype analysis showed that the affected brothers share the PRTS region at Xp22.1.

The E536A mouse had no GUS activity in any tissue and displayed a severe phenotype like that of the originally described MPS VII mice carrying a deletion mutation (gus(mps/mps)). E536Q and L175F mice had low levels of residual activity and milder phenotypes.

Two hundred and twenty seven BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were genotyped for the polymorphic AR CAG repeat, and allele size was correlated with breast/ovarian cancer morbidity parameters. Of 227 BRCA1/2 carriers, 169 were BRCA1 mutation carriers and 58 carried a BRCA2 mutation, 149 had breast and/or ovarian cancer and 78 were asymptomatic mutation carriers. The mean age at diagnosis in women with either or both neoplasms was 46.7+/-11.2 years, and that of the asymptomatic group - 45.8+/-9.4 years, a statistically insignificant difference. The AR CAG repeat ranged from eight to 28 in all tested women, and the mean number of the repeats were not statistically different between affected (18.3+/-2.4) and asymptomatic mutation carriers (18.6+/-2.1). The AR CAG repeat among patients with early onset (&lt;42 years) breast cancer was significantly shorter (17.5+/-2.3) compared with asymptomatic individuals (18.6+/-2.1) (P&lt;0.01), and the shorter allele - the younger the age at diagnosis.

In the majority of VHL-related HBs, inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene (TSG), which is located on chromosome 3p25-26, is found. The VHL gene is assumed to be involved also in the development of sporadic HBs. In a previous study of chromosomal aberrations of sporadic HBs, multiple chromosomal imbalances were found in the majority of tumors. The aim of this study was to analyze further both sporadic HBs and VHL-related HBs to determine if these histopathologically identical tumors have a different genetic background. METHODS: Sixteen sporadic HBs and seven VHL-related HBs were identified by clinical criteria and analyzed. Comparative genomic hybridization was used to screen for chromosomal imbalances throughout the entire HB genome. Additionally, mutation analysis of the VHL gene was performed using direct sequencing. Loss of chromosome 3 and multiple other chromosomal imbalances were found in the sporadic HBs, although only one imbalance, a loss of chromosome 3, was detected in the seven VHL-related HBs. Somatic VHL gene mutations were found in one third of sporadic HBs, whereas a mutation of the VHL gene was detected in all VHL-related HBs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms underlying sporadic HBs and VHL-related HBs are different. Inactivation of the VHL gene is probably not the most important event in the tumorigenesis of sporadic HBs. Other mechanisms of inhibition of VHL protein function, or inactivation of other TSGs, on chromosome 3p or on other chromosomes, might be important in the development of sporadic HBs.</text></passage></document><document><id>542</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Two novel genetic lesions and a common BH4-responsive mutation of the PAH gene in Italian patients with hyperphenylalaninemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), due to a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, is caused by mutations in the PAH gene.

The Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III has defined emerging risk factors for CAD, including small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Small, dense LDL is often accompanied by increased triglycerides (TGs) and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL). An increased number of small, dense LDL particles is often missed when the LDL cholesterol level is normal or borderline elevated. Small, dense LDL particles are present in families with premature CAD and hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, familial combined hyperlipidemia, LDL subclass pattern B, familial dyslipidemic hypertension, and syndrome X. The metabolic syndrome, as defined by ATP III, incorporates a number of the components of these syndromes, including insulin resistance and intra-abdominal fat. Subclinical inflammation and elevated procoagulants also appear to be part of this atherogenic syndrome. Overproduction of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) by the liver and increased secretion of large, apolipoprotein (apo) B-100-containing VLDL is the primary metabolic characteristic of most of these patients. The TG in VLDL is hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) which produces intermediate-density lipoprotein. The TG in intermediate-density lipoprotein is hydrolyzed further, resulting in the generation of LDL. The cholesterol esters in LDL are exchanged for TG in VLDL by the cholesterol ester tranfer proteins, followed by hydrolysis of TG in LDL by hepatic lipase which produces small, dense LDL. Cholesterol ester transfer protein mediates a similar lipid exchange between VLDL and HDL, producing a cholesterol ester-poor HDL. In adipocytes, reduced fatty acid trapping and retention by adipose tissue may result from a primary defect in the incorporation of free fatty acids into TGs. Alternatively, insulin resistance may promote reduced retention of free fatty acids by adipocytes. Both these abnormalities lead to increased levels of free fatty acids in plasma, increased flux of free fatty acids back to the liver, enhanced production of TGs, decreased proteolysis of apo B-100, and increased VLDL production. Decreased removal of postprandial TGs often accompanies these metabolic abnormalities. Genes regulating the expression of the major players in this metabolic cascade, such as LPL, cholesterol ester transfer protein, and hepatic lipase, can modulate the expression of small, dense LDL but these are not the major defects. New candidates for major gene effects have been identified on chromosome 1. Regardless of their fundamental causes, small, dense LDL (compared with normal LDL) particles have a prolonged residence time in plasma, are more susceptible to oxidation because of decreased interaction with the LDL receptor, and enter the arterial wall more easily, where they are retained more readily. Small, dense LDL promotes endothelial dysfunction and enhanced production of procoagulants by endothelial cells. Both in animal models of atherosclerosis and in most human epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, small, dense LDL (particularly when present in increased numbers) appears more atherogenic than normal LDL. Treatment of patients with small, dense LDL particles (particularly when accompanied by low HDL and hypertriglyceridemia) often requires the use of combined lipid-altering drugs to decrease the number of particles and to convert them to larger, more buoyant LDL. The next critical step in further reduction of CAD will be the correct diagnosis and treatment of patients with small, dense LDL and the dyslipidemia that accompanies it.</text></passage></document><document><id>544</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Coats'-like response in blood-filled senile retinoschisis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>59</offset></passage></document><document><id>545</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prenatal diagnosis of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset></passage></document><document><id>546</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Immunodeficiency with recurrent panlymphocytopenia, impaired maturation of B lymphocytes, impaired interaction of T and B lymphocytes, and impaired integrity of epithelial tissue: a variant of idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>228</offset><text>Idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia (ICL) has been defined as a cause of immunodeficiency with a variable clinical course and an unknown etiology.

Using two ODNs we corrected an inactivating mutation in the tyrosinase gene and introduced an activating mutation into the c-kit gene in a single albino mouse melanocyte. Relying on a pigmentation change caused by tyrosinase gene correction, we determined the frequency of gene targeting events ranging from 2 x 10(-4) to 1 x 10(-3), which is comparable to our previously published data using RDO. However, ODN showed more reproducible gene correction than RDO and produced pigmented cells among 60% of experiments, in comparison with 10% by RDO. DNA sequence analysis of the converted cells revealed that two out of eight individual pigmented clones harbored the mutated c-kit gene. Targeted modification of both genes resulted in the ability of the tyrosinase to convert tyrosine to melanin, and in the constitutive activation of the Kit receptor kinase. Thus, for the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneous targeting of two genes in a single cell and show that a selection strategy to identify cells that have undergone a gene modification can enrich the targeted cells with the desired gene alteration.</text></passage></document><document><id>551</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Oral contraceptives and the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer in young women. We examined whether this association is seen in women at high risk of breast cancer because they carry a mutation in one of two breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. METHODS: We performed a matched case-control study on 1311 pairs of women with known deleterious BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations recruited from 52 centers in 11 countries. Women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer were matched to control subjects by year of birth, country of residence, mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2), and history of ovarian cancer. All study subjects completed a questionnaire about oral contraceptive use. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived by conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among BRCA2 mutation carriers, ever use of oral contraceptives was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.24). For BRCA1 mutation carriers, ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with a modestly increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.40). However, compared with BRCA1 mutation carriers who never used oral contraceptives, those who used oral contraceptives for at least 5 years had an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.60), as did those who used oral contraceptives before age 30 (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.52), those who were diagnosed with breast cancer before age 40 (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.72), and those who first used oral contraceptives before 1975 (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.17 to 1.75). CONCLUSIONS: Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, women who first used oral contraceptives before 1975, who used them before age 30, or who used them for 5 or more years may have an increased risk of early-onset breast cancer. Oral contraceptives do not appear to be associated with risk of breast cancer in BRCA2 carriers, but data for BRCA2 carriers are limited.</text></passage></document><document><id>552</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Correlation between a specific Wilms tumour suppressor gene (WT1) mutation and the histological findings in Wilms tumour (WT).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset></passage></document><document><id>553</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Haemolytic effect of two sulphonamides evaluated by a new method.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>A technique to investigate drugs which could cause haemolysis in subjects deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glucose-6-phosphate: NADP oxidoreductase; G6PD) has been developed.

It is an uncommon disease in the Oriental population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a Chinese kindred of Fabry's disease and the relevant clinical features are discussed. The diagnosis of Fabry's disease was based on serum alpha-galactosidase A activity and typical histological features from renal biopsy in the index patient. Genetic analysis of two hemizygous male patients revealed a missense mutation predicting a leucine to proline substitution (L14P) in the alpha-galactosidase gene causing classical Fabry's disease in this family. This is a novel point mutation not described previously in the literature and the second report describing novel genetic mutations for Fabry's disease in Chinese patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fabry's disease is rare in Chinese patients but this diagnosis should be considered in patients with positive family history of kidney disease and relevant clinical features.</text></passage></document><document><id>555</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prevalence and phenotypic spectrum of cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene mutations in Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>A patient with cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency presents with marked hyperalphalipoproteinemia (HALP). To investigate the contribution of CETP deficiency to the cause of HALP (HDL-C> or =1.94 mmol/l, 75 mg/dl), we investigated the CETP activities and the prevalence of genetic CETP mutations among 624 Japanese HALP subjects. The subjects were screened for four known genetic CETP mutations (intron 14 splicing defect (In14), exon 15 missense mutation (Ex15), intron 10 splicing defect (In10) and exon 6 nonsense mutation (Ex6)). We found the frequency of the patients with reduced CETP activity (&lt;75% of normal controls) to be 55.5 and 64.1% in a high HDL group (1.94&lt; or =HDL-C&lt;2.59 mmol/l) and a marked HALP group (HDL-C> or =2.59 mmol/l, 100 mg/dl), respectively. At least one of the four mutations was identified in 65.7% of subjects with reduced CETP activities and 57.5% of subjects with marked HALP. The In14 and Ex15 mutations were very common in HALP subjects and the frequency of In10 mutation and Ex6 mutation was quite low. To investigate the impact of genetic CETP mutation on the phenotypes, we compared the plasma lipid levels and CETP activities between the subjects with two common mutations. All In14 homozygotes showed marked HALP, while marked HALP is less frequent (64.3%) in Ex15 homozygotes. HDL-C levels in Ex15 heterozygotes were significantly higher than those of In14 heterozygotes, suggesting the mutation has dominant negative effects on CETP activity in vivo. Some cases with In14 (5.7%) or Ex15 (7.2%) mutation showed low HDL-C levels. We conclude that CETP deficiency is a major cause of HALP; nevertheless CETP deficiency is not necessarily HALP.</text></passage></document><document><id>556</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene, NBS1, and molecular links to factors for genome stability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>DNA double-strand breaks represent the most potentially serious damage to a genome and hence, at least two pathways of DNA repair have evolved; namely, homologous recombination repair and non-homologous end joining. Defects in both rejoining processes result in genomic instability including chromosome rearrangements, LOH and gene mutations, which may lead to development of malignancies. Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a recessive genetic disorder, characterized by elevated sensitivity to ionizing radiation that induces double-strand breaks, and high frequency of malignancies. NBS1, the product of the gene underlying the disease, forms a multimeric complex with hMRE11/hRAD50 nuclease and recruits them to the vicinity of sites of DNA damage by direct binding to phosphorylated histone H2AX. The combination of the highly-conserved NBS1 forkhead associated domain and BRCA1 C-terminus domain has a crucial role for recognition of damaged sites. Thereafter, the NBS1-complex proceeds to rejoin double-strand breaks predominantly by homologous recombination repair in vertebrates. This process collaborates with cell-cycle checkpoints at S and G2 phase to facilitate DNA repair. NBS1 is also associated with telomere maintenance and DNA replication. Based on recent knowledge regarding NBS1, we propose here a two-step binding mechanism for damage recognition by repair proteins, and describe the molecular links to factors for genome stability.</text></passage></document><document><id>557</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome in a patient with complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>Different degrees of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency are associated with hyperuricemia, uric acid nephrolithiasis and severe gout.

Within this context, the mammalian MRE11 represents an essential multifunctional protein that promotes repair of DNA double-strand breaks and plays a role in the signaling of DNA damage response. Mutations in human hMRE11 gene could contribute to the rare "AT-like" disorder. However, at present time the functional roles of hMRE11 in these cellular processes are elusive. In the current study, we provide evidence that hMRE11 interacts physically with the mismatch repair protein hMLH1 through yeast two-hybrid analysis. In addition, we show that recombinant hMRE11 and hMLH1 proteins interact when these two proteins are coexpressed in bacterial cells, and both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from human cell extracts. Furthermore, hMRE11 and hMLH1 display similar expression patterns when examined with a human normal/tumor DNA array. Together, these data suggest that hMRE11 and hMLH1 might act in a co-operative fashion during DNA damage detection, signaling, and repair.</text></passage></document><document><id>559</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Imprinting disorders: non-Mendelian mechanisms affecting growth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Most autosomal genes are expressed from both maternal and paternal alleles. However, imprinted genes are an example of non-Mendelian genetics, in which only one member of the gene pair is expressed and expression is determined by the parent of origin. Imprinted genes may account for 0.1-1% of all mammalian genes. At least 50 imprinted genes have been identified in humans, and imprinted genes frequently cluster under the control of an imprinting center. Many imprinted genes contribute to growth, either as growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGF2 in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome), or as growth inhibitors, such as the GRB10 gene in Russell-Silver syndrome. Imprinted genes have evolved over time in mammals to fine-tune the growth of the fetus. Paternally expressed genes generally enhance growth, whereas maternally expressed genes appear to suppress growth. In addition, normal and abnormal genomic imprinting and loss of heterozygosity contribute to a wide range of malignancies. A common process for controlling gene activity is methylation, which can be changed during male or female gametogenesis. Examples of classic human disorders related to genomic imprinting are Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (chromosome 11), Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes (chromosome 15), Russell-Silver syndrome (chromosome 7), and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (chromosome 20). Several of these disorders are discussed and illustrated.</text></passage></document><document><id>560</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Deficiency of the seventh component of complement in a Taiwanese boy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>Inherited complement deficiencies are rare, particularly those associated with late components of the complement cascade.

It has been proposed that the efficiency of absorption is determined by the amount of iron acquired by developing enterocytes when they are in the crypts of Lieberk  hn and that this regulates expression of iron transporters such as DMT1 in mature enterocytes of the intestinal villi. In the crypts the cells take up iron from plasma transferrin by receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process that is influenced by the hemochromatosis protein, HFE. Hence, the availability of plasma transferrin-bound iron and the expression and function of transferrin receptors (TfR1), HFE and DMT1 should all contribute to the absorptive capacity of villus enterocytes. These aspects of the regulation and mechanism of iron absorption were investigated in genetically normal rats and mice, and in Belgrade anemic (b/b) rats and HFE knockout mice. In most experiments the function of the TfR1 was assessed by the uptake of radiolabeled transferrin-bound iron given intravenously. Absorption of non-heme iron was measured using closed in situ duodenal loops. The expression and cellular distribution of DMT1 and TfR1 were determined by in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. The uptake of transferrin-bound iron and expression of functional TfR1 was shown to occur mainly in crypt cells and to be proportional to the plasma concentration of iron. It was not impaired by the mutation of DMT1 that occurs in b/b rats but was impaired in HFE knockout mice. Iron absorption was increased in these mice but was still influenced by the level of iron stores, as in normal mice. These results are in accordance with the proposed regulation of iron absorption and suggest that DMT1 is not the only iron transporter operating within endosomes of crypt cells. This view was supported by the failure to detect DMT1 mRNA or protein in crypt cells. Expression of DMT1 mRNA and protein started at the crypt-villus junction and increased to reach highest levels in the mid-villus region. Greater expression was found in iron deficiency and less in iron loaded animals than in controls and in the iron deficient rats most of the protein was present on the brush border membrane. In normal rats the efficiency of iron absorption parallelled the level of DMT1 expression, but in b/b rats absorption was very low and independent of dietary iron content even though DMT1 was present in villus enterocytes. The results confirm the essential role of DMT1 in the uptake phase of non-heme iron absorption. When normal rats previously fed a low iron diet were given a bolus of iron by stomach tube, the subsequent absorption of iron from a test dose placed in the duodenum diminished in parallel with the expression of DMT1 mRNA and protein, commencing within 1hour and reaching low levels by 7 hours. The margination of DMT1 to the brush border membrane disappeared. These results show the level of expression and intracellular distribution and function of DMT1 respond very quickly to the iron content of the diet as well as being affected by storage iron levels.</text></passage></document><document><id>566</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Mutations of fragile histidine triad gene in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and canceration].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>BACKGROUND _ OBJECTIVE: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease. Fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene is an important tumor suppressor gene at the fragile sites region of 3p14. The authors' previous study suggested that PJS patients might have a susceptible gene at the region of 3p14.2. This study was designed to reveal the relationship between the variant of FHIT gene in PJS and its canceration. METHOD: Mutations of FHIT gene in 15 PJS patients and 20 unaffected members in 6 PJS families were determined using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism(PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing techniques. RESULTS: A non-sense mutation and a frame-shift mutation were identified at codon 54(GAA to TAA) (exon 6) which led to the change of the amino acid from glutamic acid (Glu) to stop codon, and a guanine insertion at codon 62 in exon 6 resulting in a premature stop codon TGA at codon 111 in one PJS patient. A homozygous deletion and a synonymous mutation were detected in exon 8. The homozygous deletion of exon 8 in FHIT gene was found in two polyps tissues and two cancerous tissues. And in 3 sporadic cases, the patients and their mothers have the same bands of SSCP and the same elution profiles of DHPLC when exon 8 was amplified. The DNA sequencing result showed that a synonymous mutation (polymorphism) occurred at codon 98 [CAT (H)-->CAC (H)], this mutation resulted in no change of amino acid. In addition, one base substitute from A to G mutation at 5'end, +42 nucleotide in intron 6 of FHIT gene was detected in seven patients and two unaffected members. CONCLUSION: PJS patients have low frequency point mutation of FHIT gene and their cancerous tissues had homozygous deletions in FHIT gene. This study indicated that the mutations and deletions of FHIT gene in PJS may play a role in the development of PJS and their cancerations.</text></passage></document><document><id>567</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>SF1 in the development of the adrenal gland and gonads.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>56</offset><text>SF1 (steroidogenic factor-1; NR5A1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that is expressed in the adrenal gland, gonads, spleen, ventromedial hypothalamus and pituitary gonadotroph cells. Combined approaches of targeted mutagenesis in mice and examination of the effects of naturally occurring mutations in humans have clarified the role of SF1 in steroidogenesis and development. Targeted disruption of SF1 (FTZF1) in mice prevents gonadal and adrenal development and causes male-to-female sex reversal. A heterozygous loss-of-function human SF1 mutation (G35E) was described in a patient with adrenal failure and complete 46,XY sex reversal, indicating that haploinsufficiency of this transcription factor is sufficient to cause a severe clinical phenotype. In an infant with a similar clinical phenotype, a homozygous SF1 mutation (R92Q) was identified. In functional assays, this mutant SF1 protein exhibited partial loss of DNA binding and transcriptional activity when compared with the more severe G35E P-box mutant.

CYP genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism or allele-specific PCR. Different stages of disease were considered, as follows: 90 asymptomatic carriers and 87 chronic hepatitis, 92 cirrhosis and 91 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases. Reference allele frequencies were obtained from 99 blood donors. Allele distributions among categories were compared using the chi(2) test. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to express relative risks. Independent associations were modeled by correspondence analysis and logistic regression. Frequencies of the CYP1A1 highly inducible alleles, MspI m2 and Val, were increased in liver disease patients compared with carriers; no specific association with HCC was found. The high-activity CYP2E1 c2 allele was underrepresented among HCC patients with respect to other HCV categories, including cirrhosis. CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (PM) genotypes were significantly more frequent in healthy subjects (7.1%) and carriers (11.1%) than in hepatitis/cirrhosis (4.6%) and HCC (1.2%) patients. This was confirmed by multivariable analysis. PM genotypes protected against progressive disease as ORs reduced proportionally to stage. The age at diagnosis for HCC was anticipated in non-PM individuals. No differences were seen for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 genes. Polymorphic variants of CYP genes may contribute to the progression of liver disease and HCC risk in HCV-infected subjects.</text></passage></document><document><id>570</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates the high mobility group domain protein SSRP1, inducing the recognition of UV-damaged DNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>The structure-specific recognition protein SSRP1 plays a role in transcription and replication in the chromatin context. Mediated by its C-terminal high mobility group (HMG) box domain, SSRP1 binds DNA non-sequence specifically but recognizes certain DNA structures. Using acetic acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we have examined the phosphorylation of maize SSRP1 by protein kinase CK2 alpha. The kinase phosphorylated several amino acid residues in the C-terminal part of the SSRP1 protein. Two phosphorylation sites were mapped in the very C-terminal region next to the HMG box domain, and about seven sites are localized within the acidic domain. Circular dichroism showed that the phosphorylation of the two C-terminal sites by CK2 alpha resulted in a structural change in the region of HMG box domain, because the negative peak of the CD spectrum at 222 nm was decreased by approximately 10%. In parallel, the phosphorylation induced the recognition of UV-damaged DNA, whereas the non-phosphorylated protein does not discriminate between UV-damaged DNA and control DNA. The affinity of CK2 alpha-phosphorylated SSRP1 for the DNA correlates with the degree of UV-induced DNA damage. Moreover, maize SSRP1 can restore the increased UV-sensitivity of a yeast strain lacking the NHP6A/B HMG domain proteins to levels of the control strain. Collectively, these findings indicate a role for SSRP1 in the UV response of eukaryotic cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>571</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Glutathione S-transferase M1 associated with cancer occurrence in Korean HNPCC families carrying the hMLH1/hMSH2 mutation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, has been associated with germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. However, because all mutation carriers of hMLH1/hMSH2 do not account for CRC susceptibility, modifying genes may play a role in the variation of disease expression. In this study, we determined the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes in 104 family members representing 19 Korean HNPCCs carrying hMLH1/hMSH2 mutation, and investigated the influence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 geno-/phenotype status on both age at diagnosis of CRC and cancer occurrence. The overall frequency of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 geno-/phenotype in 55 non-carriers, compared with that in mutation carriers (n=49), was not significantly different, and no significant correlation was found between mean age at diagnosis and the allelomorphs encoding the GSTM1 or GSTT1 enzymes. However, a comparison of the allele frequencies of GSTM1 in affected (n=30) and unaffected (n=19) mutation carriers revealed a significant difference, as the null allele was more prevalent in individuals with cancer (p=0.03; odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-12.7). Our results suggest that the genotypes of GSTM1 are associated with cancer occurrence in Korean HNPCC family members carrying the hMLH1/hMSH2 mutation. However, a bias due to the small sample size of this study cannot be rule out. Although evidence that GST genotypes are associated with increased cancer risk has often been controversial, the genotyping of GSTM1 could have implications for genetic counseling and the management of MMR gene mutation carriers.</text></passage></document><document><id>572</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Study on relationship between Arg778Leu/Gln gene mutation spot in ATP7B and TCM syndrome type in Chinese patients with Wilson disease].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>137</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between Arg778Leu/Gln gene mutation spot in ATP7B and TCM Syndrome type in Chinese patients with Wilson disease (WD).

METHODS: The authors reviewed the clinical course of 22 patients homozygous for mutation P426L vs 20 patients heterozygous for mutation I179S, in which the second arylsulfatase A (ASA) mutation had also been determined. RESULTS: P426L homozygotes principally presented with progressive gait disturbance caused by spastic paraparesis or cerebellar ataxia; mental disturbance was absent or insignificant at the onset of disease but became more apparent as the disease evolved. In contrast, compound heterozygotes for I179S presented with schizophrenia-like behavioral abnormalities, social dysfunction, and mental decline, but motor deficits were scarce. Reduced peripheral nerve conduction velocities and less residual ASA activity were present in P426L homozygotes vs I179S heterozygotes.

Utilizing a previously described interaction between BRCA1 and RNA helicase A (RHA), we have developed a dominant-negative approach to block BRCA1 function in human breast epithelial cells. Overexpression of a truncated RHA peptide that can bind to the BRCA1 carboxy-terminus prevents normal BRCA1 function, such as BRCA1 association with nuclear foci following DNA damage. Overexpression of this dominant-negative protein induces pleomorphic nuclei, aberrant mitoses with extra centrosomes, and tetraploidy. This model system allows us to observe changes to mammary epithelial cells that occur acutely following loss of BRCA1 function. Furthermore, inhibition of BRCA1 via overexpressing the RHA fragment coincides with a reduction in PARP-1 protein expression, suggesting a possible mechanism for BRCA1 in the maintenance of genomic integrity.</text></passage></document><document><id>576</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Surgical management and genotype/phenotype correlations in WT1 gene-related diseases (Drash, Frasier syndromes).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The WT1 gene plays a role in urogenital and gonadal development. Germline mutations of this gene have been observed in patients with Drash or Frasier syndrome (Sd). The purpose of this report is to compare phenotype and genotype of these patients. METHODS: Retrospective study of 12 patients treated since 1980 for WT1 gene-related disorders was conducted. RESULTS: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) occurred in 9 patients, mostly because of diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) or focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS). Seven patients underwent kidney transplantation, and 2 died. Eleven tumors occurred: 8 Wilms' tumors, one soft tissue tumor, one bladder papilloma, and one gonadoblastoma. Wilms' tumors occurred at a younger age than expected. Eight patients had a 46,XY karyotype. One of these XY patients had female phenotype (Frasier syndrome); she was raised as a girl with bilateral gonadectomy. Seven XY patients had ambiguous phenotype; 4 have been raised as boys and 3 as girls. Four patients had a 46,XX karyotype; they had female genitalia and were raised as girls. WT1 gene analysis was performed in 10 patients and showed heterozygous germline mutations in exon 9 (n = 6), intron 9 (n = 1), exon 3 (n = 1), exon 4 (n = 1), or exon 7 (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: ESRD was secondary to DMS when exon 9 was mutated, and secondary to FSGS when intron 9 was mutated. When exon 3, 4, and 7 were mutated, no nephropathy has been observed. Wilms' tumors occurred with any kind of WT1 mutation except intron 9. Abnormal sexual differentiation has been observed in all XY patients with WT1 mutation, and the most profound inversion of phenotype was observed with mutation in intron 9. Correlation between phenotype and genotype provides better understanding of the role of WT1, and can help the surgeon in the management of these patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>577</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular analyses in hemophilia B families: identification of six new mutations in the factor IX gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset></passage></document><document><id>578</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cytogenetic analysis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): identification of a FRAXE fragile site.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disease characterized by recurrent obsessions, compulsions, or both. The prevalence rate of OCD is 2.1% in the general population. Here we report cytogenetic analysis of 26 patients affected with OCD. In one male patient (OCD-K33), we identified a fragile X chromosome by cytogenetic analysis with 21% of cells demonstrating a fragile site at Xq27-q28. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the molecular basis of the OCD-K33 fragile X chromosome was expansion of the CCG repeat at FRAXE. The number of the expanded repeats was estimated to be more than 300 copies, qualifying it as a full FRAXE mutation. Further analysis of the family members of OCD-K33 revealed another member with a full FRAXE mutation (630-1,200 copies of the CCG repeat), who had the clinical phenotype of speech impairment, and two other members with normal phenotypes and no FRAXE expansion. The two FRAXE expansions lead to complete methylation at the CCG repeat. The co-segregation of the full FRAXE mutation with apparent neurologic disorders in the same family provides further support to the notion that FRAXE is a genetic neurologic condition. Our findings expand the spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with FRAXE mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>579</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A role for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase in synaptic plasticity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with an expanded triplet repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of the gene for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK), which may reduce DMPK expression. It is unclear how reduced DMPK expression might contribute to the symptoms of DM because the normal function of DMPK is not yet understood. Thus we investigated the function of DMPK to gain insight into how reduced DMPK expression might lead to cognitive dysfunction in DM. We recently demonstrated a role for DMPK in modifying the cytoskeleton, and remodeling of the cytoskeleton is thought to be important for cognitive function. Therefore we hypothesized that DMPK might normally contribute to synaptic plasticity and cognitive function via an effect on actin cytoskeletal rearrangements. To test for involvement of DMPK in synaptic plasticity, we utilized the DMPK null mouse. This mouse showed no changes in baseline synaptic transmission in hippocampal area CA1, nor any changes in long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) measured 3 h after induction. There was a significant decrease, however, in the decremental potentiation with a duration of 30-180 min that accompanies LTP. These results suggest a role for DMPK in synaptic plasticity that could be relevant to the cognitive dysfunction associated with DM.</text></passage></document><document><id>580</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutational analyses of Taiwanese kindred with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a neurodegenerative disorder with highly variable clinical presentation, including the childhood cerebral form, adult form adrenomyeloneuropathy, and Addison disease.

This accumulation results from mutations in the ABCD1 gene localized to Xq28. Using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of deoxyribonucleic acid, we identified five novel mutations, including a microdeletion (1624 del ATC), a splicing site mutation (intervening sequence 1 [IVS1] -2a>c), and three missense mutations (1172 T>C, 1520 G>A, and 1754 T>C), from Taiwanese kindred with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. A polymorphism involving a single nucleotide deletion in the intervening sequence 5 (IVS5 -6 del c) of the ABCD1 gene, previously misattributed as a mutation in the Chinese population, was also identified. The dinucleotide deletion (1415 del AG) mutation common in Japan and Western countries was not found as frequently in the Chinese and Taiwanese populations. Instead, a higher mutation frequency was observed in exon 6 of the ABCD1 gene among Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese kindred with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, representing a potential mutational hotspot for future mutational screening among these Asian populations.</text></passage></document><document><id>581</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Human specific loss of olfactory receptor genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>49</offset><text>Olfactory receptor (OR) genes constitute the basis for the sense of smell and are encoded by the largest mammalian gene superfamily of >1,000 genes.

We asked whether the high fraction of nonfunctional OR genes is specific to humans or is a common feature of all primates. To this end, we have compared the sequences of 50 human OR coding regions, regardless of their functional annotations, to those of their putative orthologs in chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and rhesus macaques. We found that humans have accumulated mutations that disrupt OR coding regions roughly 4-fold faster than any other species sampled. As a consequence, the fraction of OR pseudogenes in humans is almost twice as high as in the non-human primates, suggesting a human-specific process of OR gene disruption, likely due to a reduced chemosensory dependence relative to apes.</text></passage></document><document><id>582</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genomic DNA insertions and deletions occur frequently between humans and nonhuman primates.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>Comparative DNA sequence studies between humans and nonhuman primates will be important for understanding the genetic basis of the phenotypic differences between these species.

These rearrangements are distributed along the entire length of chromosome 21, with approximately 35% found in genomic intervals encoding genes (genic intervals), and have occurred in the genomes of both humans and chimpanzees. Comparison of approximately 9 Mb of human chromosome 21 with orangutan, rhesus macaque, and woolly monkey DNA sequences identified a combined total of 114 genomic rearrangements between humans and nonhuman primates. Analysis of these rearrangements revealed that they are randomly distributed with respect to genic and nongenic intervals and identified one deletion that has likely resulted in the inactivation of a gene (beta1,3-galactosyltransferase) in the woolly monkey. Our data show that genomic rearrangements have occurred frequently during primate genome evolution and significantly contribute to the DNA differences between these species. These DNA rearrangements are commonly found in genic intervals, and thus provide natural starting points for focused investigations of qualitative and quantitative gene expression differences between humans and other primates.</text></passage></document><document><id>583</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Cloning of cDNA of TSARG4, a human spermatogenesis related gene].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset><text>To understand molecular mechanism of spermatogenesis, two ESTs BG720564 and AI700454, were found from SPAG4 (sperm antigen 4), a gene related to dense fiber protein of outer membrane of the human sperm and mouse spermatocytes gene AK006225.

Requirement of ATM for both apoptosis and recovery from terminal growth arrest.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>149</offset><text>The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein plays a central role in early stages of DNA double strand break (DSB) detection and controls cellular responses to this damage. Although hypersensitive to ionizing radiation-induced clonogenic lethality, ataxia telangiectasia cells are paradoxically deficient in their ability to undergo ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. This contradiction illustrates the complexity of the central role of ATM in DNA damage response and the need for further understanding. Certain hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) compounds are implicated as occupational respiratory carcinogens at doses that are both genotoxic and cytotoxic. Cr(VI) induces a broad spectrum of DNA damage, but Cr(VI)-induced DSBs have not been reported. Here, we examined the role of ATM in the cellular response to Cr(VI) and found that Cr(VI) activates ATM. We also show that physiological targets of ATM, p53 Ser-15 and Chk2 Thr-68, were phosphorylated by Cr(VI) exposure in an ATM-dependent fashion. We found that ATM-/- cells were markedly resistant to Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis but considerably more sensitive to Cr(VI)-induced clonogenic lethality than wild type cells, indicating that resistance to Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis did not confer a selective survival advantage. However, analysis of long term growth arrest revealed a striking difference: ATM-/- cells were markedly less able to recover from Cr(VI)-induced growth arrest. This indicates that terminal growth arrest is the fate of these apoptosis-resistant cells. In summary, ATM is involved in cellular response to a complex genotoxin that may not directly induce DSBs. Our data suggest that ATM is a major signal initiator for genotoxin-induced apoptosis but, paradoxically, also contributes to maintenance of cell survival by facilitating recovery/escape from terminal growth arrest. The results also strongly suggest that terminal growth arrest is not merely an extended or even irreversible form of checkpoint arrest, but instead an independent and unique cell fate pathway.</text></passage></document><document><id>586</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification and characterization of novel mutations of the aspartoacylase gene in non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>Canavan disease, an inherited leukodystrophy, is caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene.

In the present study, the ASPA gene was analysed in 22 unrelated non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease, and 24 different mutations were found. Of these, 14 are novel, including five missense mutations (E24G, D68A, D249V, C152W, H244R), two nonsense mutations (Q184X, E214X), three deletions (923delT, 33del13, 244delA), one insertion mutation (698insC), two sequence variations in one allele ([10T>G; 11insG]), an elimination of the stop codon (941A>G, TAG-->TGG, X314W), and one splice acceptor site mutation (IVS1 - 2A>T). The E24G mutation resulted in substitution of an invariable amino acid residue (Glu) in the first esterase catalytic domain consensus sequence.

In seven families, linkage to chromosome 2 is absent, linkage is instead to chromosome 3 (3p21). In others, linkage is absent to both APOB and to 3p21. Apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) levels are approximately 25% of normal, instead of the 50% expected based on the presence of one normal allele due to reduced rates of production. The presence of the truncating mutation seems to have a "dominant recessive" effect on apoB-100 secretion. Concentrations of apoB truncations in plasma differ by truncation but average at approximately 10% of normal levels. Lipoproteins bearing truncated forms of apoB are cleared more rapidly than apoB-100 particles. In contrast with apoB-100 particles cleared primarily in liver via the LDL receptor, most apoB truncation particles are cleared in renal proximal tubular cells via megalin. Since apoB defects cause a dysfunctional VLDL-triglyceride transport system, livers accumulate fat. Hepatic synthesis of fatty acids is reduced in compensation. Informational lacunae remain about genes affecting fat accumulation in liver, and the modulation of liver fat in the presence apoB truncation defects.</text></passage></document><document><id>588</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sperm DNA analysis in a Friedreich ataxia premutation carrier suggests both meiotic and mitotic expansion in the FRDA gene. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>Friedreich ataxia is usually caused by an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the FRDA gene .

We hypothesized a higher prevalence of C282Y in Northern than in Southern Italian populations. We previously identified a nonsense mutation (E168X) in hemochromatosis probands originating from a region in the north-west of Italy. We aimed to define the prevalence of C282Y and E168X in that region and the origin of the E168X mutation by haplotype analysis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Six-hundred and six blood donors were investigated for C282Y, H63D, S65C and E168X mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction assays. Three hundred were also tested for rare HFE and TFR2 mutations by reverse-hybridization test strips. D6S265, D6S105 and D6S1281 microsatellites were analyzed to define E168X 6p-associated haplotypes. RESULTS: One C282Y homozygote, thirteen C282Y/ H63D compound heterozygotes, four E168X heterozygotes and three E168X/H63D compound heterozygotes were found. The allele frequencies of C282Y, H63D, S65C, and E168X were 4.7%, 14.9%, 0.74% and 0.58%, respectively. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of C282Y in the region investigated was much higher than that previously reported in Italy. This finding is probably due to the heavy Celtic component of this north-western population and suggests that in populations of Northern Italian descent screening studies for hemochromatosis could be cost-effective. The prevalence of E168X in this region, although low, suggests that the mutation probably originated here many years ago and its frequency increased as a result of a local founder effect. Given its severity, we suggest that the E168X mutation should be searched for in all hemochromatosis patients of Northern ancestry with an incomplete HFE genotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>590</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy at the nuclear envelope: 10 years on.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a neuromuscular degenerative condition with an associated dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac conduction defect. It can be inherited in either an X-linked or autosomal manner by mutations in the nuclear proteins emerin and lamin A/C, respectively. Traditionally muscular dystrophies were associated with defects in sarcolemma-associated proteins and, therefore, a nuclear connection suggested the existence of novel signalling pathways associated with this group of diseases. Subsequently, other mutations in the lamin A/C gene were attributed to a range of tissue-specific degenerative conditions, collectively known as the 'laminopathies'. Therefore, any proposed hypothesis underlying the molecular mechanism of EDMD needs to include this anomaly. As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the identification of emerin as a component of the nuclear envelope, I discuss here the available evidence that currently implicates EDMD as arising from perturbations in myogenic regulatory pathways, causing temporal delays in both cell cycle progression and muscle regeneration.</text></passage></document><document><id>591</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Singapore familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients with classical adenomatous polyposis but undetectable APC mutations have accelerated cancer progression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>161</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: Germline mutation in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is detected in up to 80% of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients worldwide. In this study, we evaluated clinical features and APC mutations of Singapore FAP patients and contrasted genotype-phenotype correlation with Caucasians from other regions of the world and between FAP patients with and without detectable APC mutations. METHODS: We screened 242 members from 57 unrelated FAP families using a combination of cDNA protein truncation test, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and differential expression techniques. RESULTS: APC germline mutations were detected in 50 families. In contrast to Caucasians, fundic gland polyposis in Singapore patients was associated with APC mutations throughout the coding region and osteomas were also not confined to codon 767-1573. There was also no FAP-associated hepatoblastoma or medullablastoma. APC mutation-negative patients from four families with mixed (adenomatous/hyperplastic/atypical juvenile) polyps were subsequently reclassified as hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS) patients. APC mutation-negative patients with classical adenomatous polyposis were negative for MYH, beta-catenin, and Axin 1 mutations. These patients had a significantly older age at diagnosis (P &lt; 0.001) and more colorectal cancers (P= 0.017) than patients with APC mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We achieved a 94% (50/53) APC mutation detection rate via a combination of techniques, suggesting that the current detection rate is probably not exhaustive. Singapore patients have some features similar to and other features distinct from Caucasians. Furthermore, APC mutation-negative patients have accelerated cancer progression that merits closer surveillance.</text></passage></document><document><id>592</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Unusual presentation of three siblings with familial heterozygous hypobetalipoproteinaemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>We describe three siblings with the unusual presentation of manifest steatorrhoea and vitamin E deficiency mimicking homozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia (FHBL) but whose lipid profile (cholesterol and ApoB) was consistent with heterozygous FHBL.

Consistent with these observations, recent data point to defective folding and subsequent aggregation/degradation as a predominant disease mechanism for several mutations. In this work, we use a combined approach of expression in eukaryotic cells at different temperatures and a prokaryotic system with co-expression of chaperonins to elucidate and confirm structural consequences for 18 PKU mutations. Three mutations are located in the amino terminal regulatory domain and 15 in the catalytic domain. Four mutations were found to abolish the specific activity in all conditions. Two are catalytic mutations (Y277D and E280K) and two are severe structural defects (IVS10-11G>A and L311P). All the remaining mutations (D59Y, I65T, E76G, P122Q, R158Q, G218V, R243Q, P244L, R252W, R261Q, A309V, R408Q, R408W, and Y414C) are folding defects causing reduced stability and accelerated degradation, although some of them probably affect residues involved in regulation. In these cases, we have demonstrated that the amount of mutant PAH protein and residual activity could be modulated by in vitro experimental conditions, and therefore the observed in vivo metabolic variation may be explained by interindividual variation in the quality control systems. The results derived provide an experimental framework to define the mutation severity relating genotype to phenotype. They also explain the observed inconsistencies for some mutations in patients with similar genotype and different phenotypes.</text></passage></document><document><id>594</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetics of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans family of tumors: from ring chromosomes to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DP) is a rare, slow-growing, infiltrating dermal neoplasm of intermediate malignancy, made up of spindle-shaped tumor cells often positive for CD34. The preferred treatment is wide surgical excision with pathologically negative margins. At the cytogenetic level, DP cells are characterized by either supernumerary ring chromosomes, which have been shown by using fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques to be derived from chromosome 22 and to contain low-level amplified sequences from 17q22-qter and 22q10-q13.1, or t(17;22), that are most often unbalanced. Both the rings and linear der(22) contain a specific fusion of COL1A1 with PDGFB. Similar to other tumors, the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion is occasionally cryptic, associated with complex chromosomal rearrangements. Although rings have been mainly observed in adults, translocations have been reported in all pediatric cases. DP is therefore a unique example of a tumor in which (i) the same molecular event occurs either on rings or linear translocation derivatives, (ii) the chromosomal abnormalities display an age-related pattern, and (iii) the presence of the specific fusion gene is associated with the gain of chromosomal segments, probably taking advantage of gene dosage effects. In all DP cases that underwent molecular investigations, the breakpoint localization in PDGFB was found to be remarkably constant, placing exon 2 under the control of the COL1A1 promoter. In contrast, the COL1A1 breakpoint was found to be variably located within the exons of the alpha-helical coding region (exons 6-49). No preferential COL1A1 breakpoint and no correlation between the breakpoint location and the age of the patient or any clinical or histological particularity have been described. The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion is detectable by multiplex RT-PCR with a combination of forward primers designed from a variety of COL1A1 exons and one reverse primer from PDGFB exon 2. Recent studies have determined the molecular identity of "classical" DP, giant cell fibroblastoma, Bednar tumor, adult superficial fibrosarcoma, and the granular cell variant of DP. In approximately 8% of DP cases, the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion is not found, suggesting that genes other than COL1A1 or PDGFB might be involved in a subset of cases. It has been proposed that PDGFB acts as a mitogen in DP cells by autocrine stimulation of the PDGF receptor. It is encouraging that inhibitory effects of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist imatinib mesylate have been demonstrated in vivo; such targeted therapies might be warranted in the near future for treatment of the few DP cases not manageable by surgery.</text></passage></document><document><id>595</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Common cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene polymorphisms and the effect of atorvastatin therapy in type 2 diabetes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>120</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a key role in the remodeling of triglyceride (TG)-rich and HDL particles. Sequence variations in the CETP gene may interfere with the effect of lipid-lowering treatment in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a 30-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with atorvastatin 10 mg (A10) and 80 mg (A80) in 217 unrelated patients with diabetes. RESULTS: CETP TaqIB and A-629C polymorphisms were tightly concordant (P &lt; 0.001). At baseline, B1B1 carriers had lower plasma HDL cholesterol (0.99 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.11 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.05), higher CETP mass (2.62 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.05 +/- 0.4 mg/l, P &lt; 0.001), and slightly increased, though not significant, plasma TGs (2.7 +/- 1.05 vs. 2.47 +/- 0.86, P = 0.34) compared with B2B2 carriers. Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced CETP mass dose-dependently by 18% (A10) and 29% (A80; both vs. placebo P &lt; 0.001, A10-A80 P &lt; 0.001). CETP mass and activity were strongly correlated (r = 0.854, P &lt; 0.0001). CETP TaqIB polymorphism appeared to modify the effect of atorvastatin on HDL cholesterol elevation (B1B1 7.2%, B1B2 6.1%, B2B2 0.5%; P &lt; 0.05), TG reduction (B1B1 39.7%, B1B2 38.4%, B2B2 18.4%; P = 0.08), and CETP mass reduction (B1B1 32.1%, B1B2 29.6%, B2B2 21.9%; P = 0.27, NS). Similar results were obtained for the A-629C polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the B1B1/CC carriers of the CETP polymorphisms have a more atherogenic lipid profile, including low HDL, and they respond better to statin therapy. These results favor the hypothesis that CETP polymorphisms modify the effect of statin treatment and may help to identify patients who will benefit most from statin therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>596</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Functional consequences of an LMNA mutation associated with a new cardiac and non-cardiac phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>Heritable dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetically highly heterogeneous disease. To date 17 different chromosomal loci have been described for autosomal dominant forms of dilated cardiomyopathy with or without additional clinical manifestations. Among the 10 mutated genes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene has been reported in forms associated with conduction-system disease with or without skeletal muscle myopathy. For the first time, we report here a French family affected with a new phenotype composed of an autosomal dominant severe dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects or atrial/ventricular arrhythmias, and a specific quadriceps muscle myopathy. In all previously reported cases with both cardiac and neuromuscular involvement, neuromuscular disorders preceded cardiac abnormalities. The screening of the coding sequence of the LMNA gene on all family members was performed and we identified a missense mutation (R377H) in the lamin A/C gene that cosegregated with the disease in the family. Cell transfection experiments showed that the R377H mutation leads to mislocalization of both lamin and emerin. These results were obtained in both muscular (C2C12) and non-muscular cells (COS-7). This new phenotype points out the wide spectrum of neuromuscular and cardiac manifestations associated with lamin A/C mutations, with the functional consequence of this mutation seemingly associated with a disorganization of the lamina.</text></passage></document><document><id>597</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The effect of loss of Brca1 on the sensitivity to anticancer agents in p53-deficient cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>BRCA1 is implicated in cellular responses to DNA damage, thereby substantially contributing to maintenance of the genome integrity. Mutations in the BRCA1 gene occur in breast and ovarian cancer and mutations that disable p53 are frequently found in human cancers, often accompanied by mutations in additional genes, contributing to tumor progression or high-grade malignancy. Therefore, the role of BRCA1 in the sensitivity to anticancer agents in p53-deficient cells was investigated using p53-deficient mouse knockout cell lines either deficient or proficient in Brca1 function. We report that Brca1-deficiency in p53-null cells was associated with increased sensitivity to the topoisomerase I poisons camptothecin and topotecan, the topoisomerase II poisons doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and etoposide, and to the platinum compounds carboplatin and oxaliplatin, but not to the antimetabolites 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine and the taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel. The increased growth inhibition to doxorubicin after loss of Brca1 correlated with increased cell killing caused by increased apoptosis. The data presented here indicate that Brca1 modulates p53-independent DNA damage response pathways and they support the case of a role of Brca1 to protect cells from apoptosis-mediated cell death in p53-deficient cells. These results suggest a higher chemotherapy susceptibility of cells disabled in both functions and they foster the concept that functional inhibition of BRCA1 may be a valuable adjunct to anticancer agents to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in the treatment of p53-mutated cancers.</text></passage></document><document><id>598</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Risk of malignant lymphomas in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in their first-degree relatives.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk for malignant lymphomas. Both conditions display a familial aggregation, and there are reports of RA and malignant lymphomas occurring in the same families. This study was undertaken to determine the risk of malignant lymphomas in first-degree relatives of RA patients, in order to investigate whether the increased risk of malignant lymphomas in RA could be due to genetic or environmental risk factors common to both conditions, rather than being a consequence of the rheumatic disease. METHODS: Using Swedish nationwide and population-based registers, we identified 76,527 patients hospitalized with RA in 1964-1999 and 70,290 first-degree relatives of a subset of these patients. These subjects were followed up for more than 3 decades, and information on cancer occurrence was recorded. RESULTS: Patients with RA had a significantly increased risk of malignant lymphomas (535 cases; standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 2.00, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.83-2.17), which was apparent for up to 2 decades of followup. Among the first-degree relatives without RA, no increased risk of malignant lymphomas was found overall, although modest and nonsignificantly elevated risk estimates were observed in subgroups. With respect to childhood cancer (0-14 years of age), we observed an increased risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma (5 cases; SIR 3.18, 95% CI 1.03-7.42). CONCLUSION: Patients with RA are at a markedly, but possibly time-limited, increased risk for malignant lymphomas. There is little to suggest a prominent role for coinherited or common environmental risk factors in malignant lymphomas arising in the context of RA. Instead, lymphomas complicating RA appear to be a direct consequence of the inflammation or its treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>599</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A single Mediterranean, possibly Jewish, origin for the Val59Gly CDKN2A mutation in four melanoma-prone families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>114</offset><text>We have screened for CDKN2A germline mutations in 49 Jewish families with two or more cases of melanoma. The Val59Gly mutation, one of the three different alterations identified among these families, was also detected independently in two kindreds from France and one from Spain. The impact of the Val59Gly substitution on the function of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a), a product of the CDKN2A gene, was assessed by protein-protein interaction and cell proliferation assays and related to potential structural alterations predicted by molecular modeling. Seven microsatellite markers in the vicinity of the CDKN2A gene were used to determine whether the mutation in these families is identical by descent, or represents a mutational hotspot in the CDKN2A gene. Our results show that the Val59Gly substitution impairs p16(INK4a) function, and this dysfunction is consistent with structural predictions. All melanoma-affected individuals tested in the families under study harbor this mutation. Interestingly, the Israeli pedigree includes an affected individual who is homozygous for the Val59Gly mutation. A common haplotype of microsatellite markers has been demonstrated for mutation carriers in all four pedigrees. The Israeli pedigree and one of the French melanoma families are of Moroccan and Tunisian Jewish descent, respectively, and the other families originate from regions of France and Spain close to the Pyrenees. We conclude that the Val59Gly mutation is a major contributor to melanoma risk in the families under study and that it may derive from a single ancestral founder of Mediterranean (possibly Jewish) origin.</text></passage></document><document><id>600</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Trinucleotide repeat expansion at the myotonic dystrophy locus reduces expression of DMAHP. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy , or dystrophia myotonica ( DM ) , is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK protein kinase gene on chromosome 19q13 . 3 ( refs 1-3 ) . Although the DM mutation was identified more than five years ago , the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this most prevalent form of hereditary adult neuromuscular disease remain elusive . Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a DNase l-hypersensitive site located adjacent to the repeats on the wild-type allele is eliminated by repeat expansion , indicating that large CTG-repeat arrays may be associated with a local chromatin environment that represses gene expression . Here we report that the hypersensitive site contains an enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent DMAHP homeobox gene . Analysis of DMAHP expression in the cells of DM patients with loss of the hypersensitive site revealed a two- to fourfold reduction in steady-state DMAHP transcript levels relative to wild-type controls . Allele-specific analysis of DMAHP expression showed that steady-state transcript levels from the expanded allele were greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wild-type allele .

Sequence analysis of this contig found it to contain eight known genes, including the complete genomic structure of the Parkin gene. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of 40 malignant breast and ovarian tumors identified a common minimal region of loss, including the markers D6S305 (50%) and D6S1599 (32%). Both loci exhibited the highest frequencies of LOH in this study and are each located within the Parkin genomic structure. Whereas mutation analysis revealed no missense substitutions, expression of the Parkin gene appeared to be down-regulated or absent in the tumor biopsies and tumor cell lines examined. In addition, the identification of two truncating deletions in 3 of 20 ovarian tumor samples, as well as homozygous deletion of exon 2 in the lung adenocarcinoma cell lines Calu-3 and H-1573, supports the hypothesis that hemizygous or homozygous deletions are responsible for the abnormal expression of Parkin in these samples. These data suggest that the LOH observed at chromosome 6q25-q26 may contribute to the initiation andor progression of cancer by inactivating or reducing the expression of the Parkin gene. Because Parkin maps to FRA6E, one of the most active common fragile sites in the human genome, it represents another example of a large tumor suppressor gene, like FHIT and WWOX, located at a common fragile site.</text></passage></document><document><id>602</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[5 cases of afibrinogenemia in one family].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset></passage></document><document><id>603</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Developmental expression and regulation of divalent metal transporter 1 in rat heart].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) mRNA in male Sprague-Dawley rat heart of different ages and the expression of DMT1 regulated by dietary iron.

RESULTS: (1)Two isoforms of DMT1 mRNA [with and without iron-responsive element (IRE)] were both detected in rat heart, which were correlated with heart iron content. During development, both of two isoforms of DMT1 mRNA expression were the lowest at the age of PND 7, and increased at PND 21, 63 to 196.

Here we show that OP cells, identified by expression of the platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor, express the netrin receptors dcc and unc5h1 but do not express netrin-1. Using a microchemotaxis assay, we demonstrate that migrating OPs are repelled by a gradient of netrin-1 in vitro. Furthermore, application of netrin-1 to OPs in vitro triggers retraction of OP processes. In the absence of netrin-1 or Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) function in vivo, fewer OP cells migrate from the ventral to the dorsal embryonic spinal cord, consistent with netrin-1 acting as a repellent. In addition to their role regulating cell movement, DCC and UNC-5 homologs have been suggested to function as proapoptotic dependence receptors, triggering cell death in the absence of netrin-1. In contrast, we report no evidence of increased OP cell death in vivo or in vitro in the absence of either netrin-1 or DCC.

The granulocytes remain intact, excluding trypan blue, phagocytosing, and killing bacteria, despite this activated complement exposure. It is also suggested that this chemotactic defect may involve only a clone of cells, analogous to the clonal lysis of PNH erythrocytes; those few granulocytes capable of migration after exposure to activated complement contain normal quantities of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP), in contrast to the LAP deficiency of the overall PNH granulocyte population.

In previous reports, renal involvement in APS consisted mainly of thrombotic vascular complications involving large vessels or intrarenal small-sized vessels (APS nephropathy). We report 9 cases of glomerulonephritis associated with APS. These cases are characterized by predominant pathological features distinct from vascular APS nephropathy. METHODS: We reviewed consecutive renal biopsies examined in 2 French university hospitals between 1980 and 2002 and identified renal biopsies performed in patients with primary APS. RESULTS: We identified 29 biopsies performed in patients with APS. Twenty biopsies showed characteristic features of APS nephropathy. In 9 cases, predominant pathological features distinct from vascular APS nephropathy were noted: membranous nephropathy (3 cases), minimal change disease/focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (3 cases), mesangial C3 nephropathy (2 cases), and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (1 case). In 7 cases, the presentation of renal symptoms was subacute or chronic. Two patients experienced episodes of acute renal failure. At referral, median creatinine clearance was 50 mL/min (0.83 mL/s) (range, 18 to 117 mL/min [0.30 to 1.95 mL/s]). Proteinuria was noted in all cases (range, 1.5 to 15 g/d), with nephrotic syndrome in 4 cases. Lupus anticoagulant was present in all cases, and anticardiolipin antibodies, in 8 cases. Anti-DNA antibodies repeatedly were negative in all cases. Treatment consisted of antihypertensive therapy (6 cases), anticoagulant drugs (5 cases), steroids (4 cases), and antiplatelet drugs (3 cases). At last follow-up, renal function remained stable in 7 patients. Of 2 patients presenting with acute renal failure, 1 patient recovered normal renal function, whereas the other patient progressed to end-stage renal failure. CONCLUSION: The cases reported here represent a new aspect of the expanding spectrum of renal diseases encountered in association with APS.</text></passage></document><document><id>610</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Iron, haptoglobin phenotype, and HIV-1 viral load: a cross-sectional study among pregnant Zimbabwean women.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Viral load is a determinant of HIV-1 progression and transmission.

Mean viral load was 3.85 log(10) (95% CI: 3.77-3.93) genome equivalents (geq)/mL, ranging from 3.77 (95% CI: 3.64-3.90) geq/mL in women with Hp 1-1 to 4.05 (95% CI: 3.81-4.21) geq/mL in women with Hp 2-2. With elevated serum ACT controlled for, women with Hp 2-2 had viral loads twice (95% CI: 1.4-4.0, p =.002) that of women with Hp 1-1, whereas those with serum ferritin &lt;6 micro g/L had viral loads less than one third (95% CI: 0.13-0.53, p =.013) that of women with serum ferritin >24 micro g/L. Viral loads were also higher in women enrolled in the early rainy season compared with the dry season, in gravidae 4+ compared with gravidae 1 through 3, and in those with moderately elevated compared with low serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, but neither age, gestational age, serum folate, serum retinol, nor serum beta-carotene were predictors. CONCLUSION: Storage iron, Hp 2-2, and elevated ACT are independent positive predictors of HIV-1 viral load. The positive relationship between serum ferritin and viral load was not the result of an acute phase response or iron accumulation with advanced HIV infection. A possible detrimental role of iron in HIV infection would have serious public health implications.</text></passage></document><document><id>611</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The pattern of polymorphism on human chromosome 21.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset><text>Polymorphism data from 20 partially resequenced copies of human chromosome 21-more than 20,000 polymorphic sites-were analyzed. The allele-frequency distribution shows no deviation from the simplest population genetic model with a constant population size (although we show that our analysis has no power to detect population growth). The average rate of recombination per site is estimated to be roughly one-half of the rate of mutation per site, again in agreement with simple model predictions. However, sliding-window analyses of the amount of polymorphism and the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) show significant deviations from standard models. This could be due to the history of selection or demographic change, but it is impossible to draw strong conclusions without much better knowledge of variation in the relationship between genetic and physical distance along the chromosome.</text></passage></document><document><id>612</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations in the ST7/RAY1/HELG locus rarely occur in primary colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinomas.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>Human cancers frequently show a loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 7q31, which indicates the existence of broad-range tumour-suppressor gene(s) at this locus. Truncating mutations in the ST7 gene at this locus are seen frequently in primary colon cancer and breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, the ST7 gene represents a novel candidate gene for the tumour suppressor at this locus. However, more recent studies have reported that ST7 mutations are infrequent or absent in primary cancer and cell lines. To ascertain the frequency of mutations of the ST7 gene in cancer cells, we examined mutations in the ST7 coding sequence in 48 colorectal, 48 gastric, and 48 hepatocellular carcinomas using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing. We detected somatic mutations, which were located near the exon-intron junction in intron 8, in only three out of 144 cases. We conclude that mutations in the ST7 gene are rare in primary colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinomas.</text></passage></document><document><id>613</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in Korean patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>BACKGROUND: By genetic analysis, the CAG repeat expansion has been established in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Despite the genetic differentiation of SCA, the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genetic analysis in 253 unrelated Korean patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia. We compared the frequencies, inheritance patterns, and various clinical manifestations of patients with genetically confirmed SCA. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with expanded CAG repeat, the most frequent SCA type was SCA2, followed by SCA3, SCA6, SCA1, and SCA7. Nine patients (17%) had a negative family history of ataxia, mostly in SCA6. There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and optic atrophy for SCA1; hyporeflexia for SCA2; nystagmus, bulging eye, and dystonia for SCA3; and macular degeneration for SCA7. Interestingly, 4 patients (1 with SCA2, 1 with SCA3, and 2 with SCA6) were misdiagnosed as having multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence of parkinsonism and urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients. Although phenotypes were heterogeneous, some clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis. However, genetic studies for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical parkinsonism.</text></passage></document><document><id>614</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Chemical diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry detection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>97</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is caused by a severe deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and clinically characterized by self-injurious behavior and nephrolithiasis; the latter is treatable with allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase which converts xanthine and hypoxanthine into uric acid. In the HPRT gene, more than 200 different mutations are known, and de novo mutation occurs at a high rate. Thus, there is a great need to develop a highly specific method to detect patients with HPRT dysfunction by quantifying the metabolites related to this enzyme. A simplified urease pretreatment of urine, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and stable isotope dilution method, developed for cutting-edge metabonomics, was further applied to quantify hypoxanthine, xanthine, urate, guanine and adenine in 100 microl or less urine or eluate from filter-paper-urine strips by additional use of stable isotope labeled guanine and adenine as the internal standards. In this procedure, the recoveries were above 93% and linearities (r(2)=0.9947-1.000) and CV values (below 7%) of the indicators were satisfactory. In four patients with proven LNS, hypoxanthine was elevated to 8.4-9.0 SD above the normal mean, xanthine to 4-6 SD above the normal mean, guanine to 1.9-3.7 SD, and adenine was decreased. Because of the allopurinol treatment for all the four patients, their level of urate was not elevated, orotate increased, and uracil was unchanged as compared with the control value. It was concluded that even in the presence of treatment with allopurinol, patients with LNS can be chemically diagnosed by this procedure. Abnormality in the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine was quite prominent and n, the number of standard deviations above the normal mean, combined for the two, was above 12.9.</text></passage></document><document><id>615</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of the transcription regulator, CNOT7, as a candidate chromosome 8 tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>120</offset><text>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 8 occurs at high frequencies in many tumor types, including colorectal carcinoma. We have previously used microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) to map an approximately 7.7 Mb colorectal cancer suppressor region (CRCSR) at 8p22-23.1. We have now taken a candidate gene approach to identify the putative tumor suppressor gene located within the CRCSR. CNOT7 encodes a subunit of the CCR4-Not transcription complex and is located at 8p22. We showed that CNOT7 is expressed in normal colonic mucosa and in colonic crypt cells, as well as in colorectal cell lines and primary tumors. We assembled a panel of 88 primary colorectal tumors comprising 20 MSI-high (high microsatellite instability), 19 MSI-low and 49 MSS (microsatellite stable) tumors for mutation analysis of the CNOT7 gene. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis of the entire coding region of the CNOT7 gene revealed only one somatic missense mutation in an MSS tumor. The rarity of somatic mutations in CNOT7, and its expression in primary colorectal tumors and cell lines, suggests that CNOT7 is not the target tumor suppressor gene in the 8p22-23.1 CRCSR.</text></passage></document><document><id>616</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>RFLP detected by a genomic probe from the human X-linked proteolipid protein gene, PLP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset></passage></document><document><id>617</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of genomic structure and polymorphisms in the human carbamyl phosphate synthetase I gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Human carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) is an essential hepatic enzyme that initiates the urea cycle.

This work was generated from direct sequence determination of human genomic DNA (35 introns) and comparison to public domain sequence of anonymous BACs (2 introns). The human CPSI gene spans >120kb of genomic DNA. CPSI has 38 exons and 37 introns, and all adhere to the consensus splicing sequences. Comparison of the human and rat CPSI genes reveals that the nucleotide sequences, amino acid sequences, and intron-exon organizations are highly similar. We report the primers and conditions for screening the human CPSI exonic and bordering intronic sequences. We also screened 100 individuals for polymorphisms in the human CPSI gene and identified 14 polymorphisms in the CPSI message. The knowledge of the CPSI gene structure and the 14 polymorphisms presented in this study will greatly facilitate future molecular studies involving the CPSI gene and the enzyme it encodes.</text></passage></document><document><id>618</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Allosteric activation of PTEN phosphatase by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor that is lost in many human tumors and encodes a phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatase specific for the 3-position of the inositol ring. Here we report a novel mechanism of PTEN regulation. Binding of di-C8-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 (PI(4,5)P2) to PTEN enhances phosphatase activity for monodispersed substrates, PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2. PI(5)P also is an activator, but PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,5)P2 do not activate PTEN. Activation by exogenous PI(4,5)P2 is more apparent with PI(3,4)P2 as a substrate than with PI(3,4,5)P3, probably because hydrolysis of PI(3,4)P2 yields PI(4)P, which is not an activator. In contrast, hydrolysis of PI(3,4,5)P3 yields a potent activator, PI(4,5)P2, creating a positive feedback loop. In addition, neither di-C4-PI(4,5)P2 nor inositol trisphosphate-activated PTEN. Hence, the interaction between PI(4,5)P2 and PTEN requires specific, ionic interactions with the phosphate groups on the inositol ring as well as hydrophobic interactions with the fatty acid chains, likely mimicking the physiological interactions that PTEN has with the polar surface head groups and the hydrophobic core of phospholipid membranes. Mutations of the apparent PI(4,5)P2-binding motif in the PTEN N terminus severely reduced PTEN activity. In contrast, mutation of the C2 phospholipid-binding domain had little effect on PTEN activation. These results suggest a model in which a PI(4,5)P2 monomer binds to PTEN, initiates an allosteric conformational change and, thereby, activates PTEN independent of membrane binding.</text></passage></document><document><id>619</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Serum prolactin in symptomatic and asymptomatic dopa-responsive dystonia due to a GCH1 mutation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>97</offset></passage></document><document><id>620</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Autosomal dominant familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Autosomal dominant familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (adFNDI) is a rare disorder caused by progressive postnatal arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency resulting from mutations in the AVP gene encoding the AVP pre-prohormone.

METHODS: A group of 47 patients from 21 unrelated families with ADNFLE were screened for mutations in CHRNA4. Clinical features and EEG findings in the patients were consistent with those reported in the literature for other affected families. The entire gene was amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by multitemperature single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (MSSCP) and sequencing. RESULTS: A c.851C>T transition in exon 5 of CHRNA4 was identified in three affected individuals from two generations of the same family, but not in the remaining patients or in 100 healthy volunteers. This mutation caused an S284L substitution in the transmembrane domain M2 segment of the alpha4 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The same mutation had previously been detected in a single Japanese family with ADNFLE, and in an Australian woman with a sporadic form of NFLE.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of women and their offspring who were identified from the Western Australian Maternal PKU Program (WAMPKUP) from 1991 to 2000 was carried out. Cognitive assessments (K-BIT or Griffiths scales) were conducted on women and their children, and behavioural assessments (CBCL) were conducted on the children. RESULTS: Thirty pregnancies by nine women were registered on the WAMPKUP between 1991 and 2000. There were 16 live births, with one preterm delivery at 32 weeks. There were no congenital abnormalities. Five of the nine mothers and their nine children (aged 18 months-10 years) participated in developmental assessments. A linear relationship was shown between lower maternal IQ scores and later attainment of metabolic control in pregnancy (rs = -0.828; P = 0.01). There was significant correlation between lower offspring IQ scores and later attainment of metabolic control in pregnancy (rs = -0.734; P = 0.02). Correlation between maternal and offspring cognitive scores was not significant. Four of nine (44%) children rated in the clinical range for behavioural problems. Compared to children with no behavioural difficulties, these children had lower cognitive abilities (P = 0.05) and maternal metabolic control during pregnancy was poor (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Poor metabolic control in pregnancy is associated with poorer cognitive outcomes and increased behavioural difficulties in offspring of mothers with PKU. The results have implications for the implementation of appropriate dietary measures before conception in PKU pregnancies, and indicate a need for the establishment of multidisciplinary teams to follow up individuals with PKU to communicate the importance of pregnancy planning, to manage PKU pregnancies, and to follow up the offspring.</text></passage></document><document><id>625</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel deletion in the GJA12 gene causes Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) are hypomyelinating disorders of the central nervous system with a very similar phenotype.

METHODS: Five intragenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and three microsatellite markers flanking the TGFB1 locus were genotyped. Seven hundred and sixty-two individuals from 184 multiplex families were genotyped for the microsatellite markers and two of the promoter SNPs. One thousand and two individuals from 212 English and 170 Finnish families with AS were genotyped for all five intragenic SNPs. A structured questionnaire was used to assess the age of symptom onset, disease duration and disease severity scores, including the BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) and BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index). RESULTS: A weak association was noted between the rare TGFB1 +1632 T allele and AS in the Finnish population (P = 0.04) and in the combined data set (P = 0.03). No association was noted between any other SNPs or SNP haplotype and AS, even among those families with positive non-parametric linkage scores. The TGFB1 +1632 polymorphism was also associated with a younger age of symptom onset (English population, allele 2 associated with age of onset greater by 4.2 yr, P = 0.05; combined data set, allele 2 associated with age of onset greater by 3.2 yr, P = 0.02). A haplotype of coding region SNPs (TGFB1 +869/+915+1632 alleles 2/1/2) was associated with age of symptom onset in both the English parent-case trios and the combined data set (English data set, haplotype 2/1/2 associated with age of onset greater by 4.9 yr, P = 0.03; combined data set, haplotype 2/1/2 associated with greater age of onset by 4.2 yr, P = 0.006). Weak linkage with AS susceptibility was noted and the peak LOD score was 1.3 at distance 2 cM centromeric to the TGFB1 gene. No other linkage or association was found between quantitative traits and the markers. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the polymorphisms within the TGFB1 gene play at most a small role in AS and that other genes encoded on chromosome 19 are involved in susceptibility to the disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>627</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The upstream open reading frame mediates constitutive effects on translation of cytochrome p-450c27 from the seventh in-frame AUG codon in rat liver.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>150</offset><text>The 2.3-kb mRNA that codes for cytochrome P-450c27 (CYP27) has an unexpectedly long 5'-untranslated region (UTR) that holds six AUGs, leading to several upstream open reading frames (uORFs). The initiation of translation from the seventh AUG forms a putative 55-kDa precursor, which is processed in mitochondria to form a 52-kDa mature protein. The first three AUGs form fully overlapping uORF1, uORF2, and uORF3 that are in-frame with the seventh AUG and next two form fully overlapping uORF4 and uORF5 that are out-of-frame with the seventh AUG. Although not recognized by the scanning ribosomes under normal conditions, the sixth in-frame AUG forms a putative 57-kDa extension of the main open reading frame. The purpose of this study was to identify the elements in the 5'-UTR that direct CYP27 mRNA translation exclusively from the seventh AUG. Expression of 5' deletion mutants in COS cells reveal that the intact 5'-UTR not only directs the initiation of translation from the seventh AUG but also acts as a negative regulator. A 2-kb deletion mutant that lacks uORF1 initiates translation equally from the sixth and the seventh AUGs, forming both 57- and 55-kDa precursor proteins with a 2-fold increase in rate of translation. However, induction in translation does not affect the levels of the mature 52-kDa form in mitochondria but causes accumulation of the precursor form in cytosol not seen in COS cells transfected with wild-type cDNA. Mutation of the stop codon that terminates uORF1 completely shifts the initiation of translation from the seventh to the first AUG, forming a 67-kDa precursor that is processed into a 52-kDa mature protein in mitochondria. Confirmation of the bicistronic nature of CYP27 mRNA by epitope mapping of uORF1 suggests that translation of CYP27 mRNA from the seventh AUG is directed and regulated by uORF1 expression.</text></passage></document><document><id>628</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants protect Friedreich Ataxia fibroblasts from endogenous oxidative stress more effectively than untargeted antioxidants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>153</offset><text>Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA), the most common inherited ataxia, arises from defective expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin, which leads to increased mitochondrial oxidative damage. Therefore, antioxidants targeted to mitochondria should be particularly effective at slowing disease progression. To test this hypothesis, we compared the efficacy of mitochondria-targeted and untargeted antioxidants derived from coenzyme Q10 and from vitamin E at preventing cell death due to endogenous oxidative stress in cultured fibroblasts from FRDA patients in which glutathione synthesis was blocked. The mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ was several hundredfold more potent than the untargeted analog idebenone. The mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoVit E was 350-fold more potent than the water soluble analog Trolox.

Mutations in peripherin-2 are responsible for various retinal degenerative diseases including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). To identify determinants required for peripherin-2 targeting to disk membranes and elucidate mechanisms underlying ADRP, we have generated transgenic Xenopus tadpoles expressing wild-type and ADRP-linked peripherin-2 mutants as green fluorescent fusion proteins in rod photoreceptors. Wild-type peripherin-2 and P216L and C150S mutants, which assemble as tetramers, targeted to disk membranes as visualized by confocal and electron microscopy. In contrast the C214S and L185P mutants, which form homodimers, but not tetramers, were retained in the rod inner segment. Only the P216L disease mutant induced photoreceptor degeneration. These results indicate that tetramerization is required for peripherin-2 targeting and incorporation into disk membranes. Tetramerization-defective mutants cause ADRP through a deficiency in wild-type peripherin-2, whereas tetramerization-competent P216L peripherin-2 causes ADRP through a dominant negative effect, possibly arising from the introduction of a new oligosaccharide chain that destabilizes disks. Our results further indicate that a checkpoint between the photoreceptor inner and outer segments allows only correctly assembled peripherin-2 tetramers to be incorporated into nascent disk membranes.</text></passage></document><document><id>630</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A mutation in autosomal dominant myotonia congenita affects pore properties of the muscle chloride channel. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita is an inherited disorder of skeletal muscle caused by mutations in a voltage-gated Cl- channel gene ( CLCN1 , 7q35 ) .

We performed a blind chromosomal analysis on G2-phase lymphocytes from 7 unrelated A-T patients , 13 obligate A-T heterozygotes ( parents of the patients ) , and 14 normal controls following X-irradiation with 1 Gy in order to evaluate this cytogenetic method as a tool for detection of ATM carriers .

METHODS: A-SAA, CRP, ESR, fibrinogen and ferritin levels were measured in 183 patients [88 F, 95 M; median age 11.0 years (1.0-20.0)] with FMF during an attack-free period. Mutational analysis was available in 157 patients. The colchicine dose was increased in 26 randomly chosen patients with no attacks within the last year; laboratory studies were repeated at the end of the second month. RESULTS: During an attack-free period, the median A-SAA level was 74 (6-1,500) mg/L; other APPs were within normal ranges in 49-93% of the patients. Age, gender, age at onset, age at diagnosis, the duration of treatment and the frequency of attacks had no significant effect on the A-SAA level. Homozygous and compound heterozygous patients had higher A-SAA levels than heterozygous patients [129 mg/L (8-1,500) versus 29 mg/L (6-216); p &lt; 0.005]. There was a dramatic decrease in the A-SAA level [from 244 mg/L (16-1,400) to 35.5 mg/L (8-1,120); p &lt; 0.001] and an increase in the hemoglobin (1.89 +/- 0.10 mmol/L to 1.98 +/- 0.19 mmol/L; p &lt; 0.005) after the increase in colchicine dose in 26 patients. CONCLUSION: Subclinical inflammation continues during an attack-free period in FMF patients. A-SAA was the best marker of subclinical inflammation. Patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygotes of MEFV mutations had higher A-SAA levels. An increase in the colchicine dose resulted in a dramatic decrease in A-SAA and an increase in hemoglobin level. These findings favor the use of A-SAA in drug monitoring.</text></passage></document><document><id>633</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Platelet-derived growth factor and its receptors are related to the progression of human muscular dystrophy: an immunohistochemical study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>139</offset><text>This study has examined the immunological localization of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A, PDGF-B, and PDGF receptor (PDGFR) alpha and beta to clarify their role in the progression of muscular dystrophy. Biopsied frozen muscles from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) were analysed immunohistochemically using antibodies raised against PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and PDGFR alpha and beta. Muscles from two dystrophic mouse models (dy and mdx mice) were also immunostained with antibodies raised against PDGFR alpha and beta. In normal human control muscle, neuromuscular junctions and vessels were positively stained with antibodies against PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGFR alpha and PDGFR beta. In human dystrophic muscles, PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGFR alpha and PDGFR beta were strongly immunolocalized in regenerating muscle fibres and infiltrating macrophages. PDGFR alpha was also immunolocalized to the muscle fibre sarcolemma and necrotic fibres. The most significant finding in this study was a remarkable overexpression of PDGFR beta and, to a lesser extent, PDGFR alpha in the endomysium of DMD and CMD muscles. PDGFR was also overexpressed in the interstitium of muscles from dystrophic mice, particularly dy mice. Double immunolabelling revealed that activated interstitial fibroblasts were clearly positive for PDGFR alpha and beta. However, DMD and CMD muscles with advanced fibrosis showed very poor reactivity against PDGF and PDGFR. Those findings were confirmed by immunoblotting with PDGFR beta. These findings indicate that PDGF and its receptors are significantly involved in the active stage of tissue destruction and are associated with the initiation or promotion of muscle fibrosis. They also have roles in muscle fibre regeneration and signalling at neuromuscular junctions in both normal and diseased muscle.</text></passage></document><document><id>634</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Long-term evaluation of retinal function in Prph2Rd2/Rd2 mice following AAV-mediated gene replacement therapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>111</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Prph2(Rd2/Rd2) mice have a retinal degeneration due to a null mutation for the Prph2 gene which encodes a photoreceptor-specific glycoprotein, peripherin2, essential for outer-segment formation. We have previously shown improvement of photoreceptor function at a single time point following AAV-mediated gene replacement therapy. Here we quantify the functional rescue over a 15-week time course and present a detailed analysis of the improvement in retinal function. METHODS: An AAV2 vector, AAV.rho.rds, carrying a peripherin2 c-DNA, was in injected subretinally into 10-day-old Prph2(Rd2/Rd2) mice. One group was injected at a single time point while in a second group the injections were repeated after 5 days. The effect of treatment was analysed histologically using electron microscopy and electroretinography (ERG) was used to assess functional changes. Treated mice were recorded at regular intervals over 15 weeks. Untreated contralateral eyes served as internal control. RESULTS: A significant increase in b-wave amplitude was first noted 3 weeks after treatment of 10-day-old Prph2(Rd2/Rd2) mice and persisted for up to 14 weeks. An increase in the area of retina exposed to vector resulted in a significant increase in both b-wave amplitude and persistence. CONCLUSIONS: In this study AAV-mediated gene replacement in Prph2(Rd2/Rd2) mice resulted in a significant functional improvement over a period of 14 weeks. These results support the utility of gene therapy approaches as treatment for photoreceptor dystrophies.</text></passage></document><document><id>635</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel missense mutation in Van der Woude syndrome: usefulness of fingernail DNA for genetic analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal-dominant oral facial disorder. To find a gene mutation in a Japanese family using fingernail DNA samples, we performed this study. We hypothesized that a gene mutation in IRF6 might be involved in VWS, and that fingernail DNA samples may be valuable for detecting such mutations. Linkage and haplotype analyses of the family mapped the disease locus to the 1q32-q41 region. Mutation analysis with an improved extraction method for fingernail DNA detected a novel missense mutation (1046A>T, E349V) in exon 7 of IRF6 in all the affected members of the family. Since the E349V change may disturb the hydrophobic core and affect regulatory activity of IRF6, it is most likely that the mutation is causative for VWS in this family. Fingernail DNA is thus useful for linkage and mutation analyses, since the fingernail can be easily obtained non-invasively, sent through the mail, and stored for a long period. We emphasize here the usefulness of fingernail DNA for the genetic analysis of a disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>636</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Differential involvement of the hMRE11/hRAD50/NBS1 complex, BRCA1 and MLH1 in NF-kappaB activation by camptothecin and X-ray.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>Camptothecin (CPT) and X-ray (XR) generate double-strand breaks (DSB) that can be processed by homologous or nonhomologous recombination. We studied the participation of proteins involved in recombination pathways and cell cycle control in the signal transduction between DNA damage and NF-kappaB. Cells harbouring mutated NBS, hMRE11, BRCA1 or MLH1 were analysed. NBS- and hMRE11-deficient cells present a classical kinetic of NF-kappaB induction after camptothecin treatment. When DSB are generated by XR, NBS-deficient cells exhibit a delayed and strongly reduced level of NF-kappaB induction, whereas the hMRE11 mutated cells do not induce NF-kappaB at all. This indicates an important role of the hMRE11/hRAD50/NBS complex in the signal transduction initiated by XR. In HCC1937 cells that express a truncated version of BRCA1, XR induces a very rapid and transient NF-kappaB activation, whereas CPT leads to a delayed activation suggesting that BRCA1 modulates the transduction pathways in different manners after these two stresses. Finally, we found that a proficient MMR pathway is essential to the NF-kappaB activation after both CPT and XR. These results indicate that DSB originating from XR or CPT do not induce NF-kappaB in a unique way. MMR participates in both cascades, whereas the hMRE11/hRAD50/NBS trimer is specifically involved in the response elicited by XR.</text></passage></document><document><id>637</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutational spectrum of the WFS1 gene in Wolfram syndrome, nonsyndromic hearing impairment, diabetes mellitus, and psychiatric disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>135</offset><text>WFS1 is a novel gene and encodes an 890 amino-acid glycoprotein (wolframin), predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in WFS1 underlie autosomal recessive Wolfram syndrome and autosomal dominant low frequency sensorineural hearing impairment (LFSNHI) DFNA6/14. In addition, several WFS1 sequence variants have been shown to be significantly associated with diabetes mellitus and this gene has also been implicated in psychiatric diseases. Wolfram syndrome is highly variable in its clinical manifestations, which include diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. Wolfram syndrome mutations are spread over the entire coding region, and are typically inactivating, suggesting that a loss of function causes the disease phenotype. In contrast, only non-inactivating mutations have been found in DFNA6/14 families, and these mutations are mainly located in the C-terminal protein domain. In this paper, we provide an overview of the currently known disease-causing and benign allele variants of WFS1 and propose a potential genotype-phenotype correlation for Wolfram syndrome and LFSNHI.</text></passage></document><document><id>638</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Adenomatous polyposis coli gene, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression in proximal and distal gastric cancers and precursor lesions: an immunohistochemical study using tissue microarrays.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>190</offset><text>The aims of this study were (1) to compare protein expression of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin between proximal and distal gastric adenocarcinomas and (2) to investigate their use as markers of cancer risk in intestinal metaplasia (IM). The epidemiology of proximal (cardia and gastroesophageal junction) and distal (antrum and corpus) gastric carcinomas is strikingly different despite similar morphologies. Carcinoma of the distal stomach is decreasing in incidence, whereas proximal carcinomas are increasing in incidence more than any other cancer in the Western world. This phenomenon has so far not been satisfactorily explained. IM is a well-established precursor for adenocarcinoma in the distal stomach but less so in the proximal stomach. However, its specificity as a predictor of gastric carcinoma is very low. Abnormalities of APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin are implicated in carcinogenesis of the stomach and may show aberrant expression at early stages of the neoplastic process. This study evaluated their immunoprofiles in 3 groups: biopsies showing normal mucosa (n = 108), biopsies showing IM (n = 99), and gastric cancer resections (n = 117). In the last group, carcinoma and noninvolved mucosa were studied. All groups included material from both proximal and distal locations. The results of this study showed that there were no differences between proximal and distal locations with regard to APC, beta-catenin, or E-cadherin expression. In both locations, high normal expression rates for all 3 molecules were present in biopsies showing normal gastric mucosa or IM and noninvolved mucosa from gastric cancer resections. In carcinomas, there was a significant decrease in both APC and E-cadherin expression, whereas beta-catenin showed abnormal cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. Diffuse-type cancers showed significantly lower E-cadherin expression than intestinal types. Noninvolved mucosa from cancer resections showed normal APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression regardless of adjacent tumor type and whether the mucosa was morphologically normal or showed IM. In conclusion, proximal and distal gastric carcinomas show no differences in expression of APC, beta-catenin, or E-cadherin; thus, the observed abnormalities do not seem to contribute to the observed epidemiologic differences between these tumors. Because loss of APC, decreased E-cadherin, or abnormal beta-catenin expression did not occur in IM, even when associated with carcinoma these immunostains are unlikely to be of value in the assessment of malignant potential in IM.</text></passage></document><document><id>639</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Colorectal cancer and genetic alterations in the Wnt pathway.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>62</offset><text>In colorectal tumours, Wnt pathway genetics continues to be dominated by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Germline mutations cause familial adenomatous polyposis and at least two-thirds of sporadic colorectal tumours also acquire APC mutations, quite possibly as the initiating events in tumorigenesis. These mutations almost always cause loss of the C-terminal functions of the APC protein - probably involved in microtubule binding, cell polarity and chromosome segregation - and deletion of the SAMP repeats that are important for binding to axin and formation of the beta-catenin phosphorylation complex. The truncated APC proteins are, in general, stable and almost certainly retain some activity in beta-catenin binding. The 'two hits' at APC are coselected so as to produce an optimal activation of Wnt signalling (just-right hypothesis). In a minority of colorectal tumours, Wnt activation can occur through mutations that affect phosphorylation sites within exon 3 of beta-catenin, causing protein stabilization. In other tumours, epigenetic transcriptional silencing or mutation of the secreted frizzled-related proteins may modulate Wnt levels. Mutations in the Wnt components AXIN1, AXIN2 and TCF4 have been found in microsatellite-unstable colon cancers, but it is not clear in every case whether these changes are functional. Therapeutic modulation of the Wnt pathway remains an attractive therapeutic possibility for colorectal carcinomas.</text></passage></document><document><id>640</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Thin basement membrane nephropathy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>36</offset><text>Thin basement membrane nephropathy. Thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) is the most common cause of persistent glomerular bleeding in children and adults, and occurs in at least 1% of the population. Most affected individuals have, in addition to the hematuria, minimal proteinuria, normal renal function, a uniformly thinned glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and a family history of hematuria. Their clinical course is usually benign. However, some adults with TBMN have proteinuria >500 mg/day or renal impairment. This is more likely in hospital-based series of biopsied patients than in the uninvestigated, but affected, family members. The cause of renal impairment in TBMN is usually not known, but may be due to secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or immunoglobulin A (IgA) glomerulonephritis, to misdiagnosed IgA disease or X-linked Alport syndrome, or because of coincidental disease. About 40% families with TBMN have hematuria that segregates with the COL4A3/COL4A4 locus, and many COL4A3 and COL4A4 mutations have now been described. These genes are also affected in autosomal-recessive Alport syndrome, and at least some cases of TBMN represent the carrier state for this condition. Families with TBMN in whom hematuria does not segregate with the COL4A3/COL4A4 locus can be explained by de novo mutations, incomplete penetrance of hematuria, coincidental hematuria in family members without COL4A3 or COL4A4 mutations, and by a novel gene locus for TBMN. A renal biopsy is warranted in TBMN only if there are atypical features, or if IgA disease or X-linked Alport syndrome cannot be excluded clinically. In IgA disease, there is usually no family history of hematuria. X-linked Alport syndrome is much less common than TBMN and can often be identified in family members by its typical clinical features (including retinopathy), a lamellated GBM without the collagen alpha3(IV), alpha4(IV), and alpha5(IV) chains, and by gene linkage studies or the demonstration of a COL4A5 mutation. Technical difficulties in the demonstration and interpretation of COL4A3 and COL4A4 mutations mean that mutation detection is not used routinely in the diagnosis of TBMN.</text></passage></document><document><id>641</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Distribution of DMT 1 within the human glandular system.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>57</offset><text>BACKGROUND _ AIMS: DMT1 is a transmembrane protein which transports the divalent metal ions Fe2+, Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+. Although DMT1 has been functionally linked to duodenal absorption and cellular utilisation of iron hardly anything is known about its distribution and potential role within the human glandular system. METHODS: Two polyclonal antibodies were raised to study the expression of DMT1 in tissues obtained from human corpus by the means of immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. RESULTS: All antibodies specifically detected a 60 kD protein band referring to human DMT1. Significant amounts of DMT1 expression were detected on the luminal site of organs, which are involved in excretion/re-absorption processes, such as salivary glands, pancreas, biliary tract and gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DMT1 may be of pivotal importance for the regulation of metal ion homeostasis within organs involved in absorption and excretion of ions.</text></passage></document><document><id>642</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The second kindred with autosomal dominant distal myopathy linked to chromosome 14q: genetic and clinical analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>116</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Distal myopathies (MPDs) are genetically heterogeneous. Genetic causes within this subgroup of muscle disorders remain largely unknown. An MPD linked to chromosome 14q11-q13 (MPD1) is rare, and to our knowledge, only one family with definitive linkage has been described. OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of clinical and genetic analysis of the second kindred with MPD1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have identified a family with an MPD segregating in an autosomal dominant fashion. We tested linkage to previously identified genetic loci on chromosomes 2p, 2q, and 14q. The coding sequence of PABP2 (the polyadenylate-binding protein 2 gene) was analyzed. RESULTS: Every affected individual had selective weakness of foot extensors, with the average age of symptom onset at 20 years. Some patients also had proximal weakness, but none had signs of finger or hand extensor muscle involvement, even in advanced stages of the disease. Two typically affected individuals had signs of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Genetic analysis detected a tight linkage to chromosome 14q11-q13. Recombination at the telomeric end of the 14q11-q13 locus was found in an unaffected individual who was not considered to be at risk, potentially reducing the locus interval by 2 centimorgans. No mutations in the PABP2 gene were identified. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our described family is only the second known kindred with a chromosome 14-linked MPD in whom the linkage has been unequivocally established. We did not detect signs of involvement of hand or finger extensors and neck muscles, seen in the original family with MPD1. The degree and frequency of proximal weakness seem to be more prominent than in other patients with MPD1. Haplotype analysis suggests that the gene is located between polymorphic microsatellite markers D14S283 and D14S1034 on chromosome 14q11-q13. The presence of cardiomyopathy in some affected individuals may help in the identification of candidate genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>643</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphic variation within "conserved" sequences at the 3' end of the human RDS gene which results in amino acid substitutions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>130</offset><text>The human RDS gene, previously mapped to chromosome 6p, encodes a protein found in the outer disc membrane of the photoreceptor cells of the retina.

Mutations in the RDS gene have recently been implicated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) in some families. Here we present evidence that the third exon of this gene is subject to polymorphic variation in humans. The three sequence alterations described in this paper give rise to amino acid substitutions. However, as these missense mutations also occur in the normal population they are not implicated as causing adRP. Interestingly such sequence variation is not found within other species examined including mouse and bovine. These intragenic polymorphisms will be of future potential value in studies to locate further disease causing mutations in adRP patients in the RDS gene.</text></passage></document><document><id>644</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fragile X founder effect?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>26</offset></passage></document><document><id>645</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the Huntington's disease region at the D4S43 locus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset></passage></document><document><id>646</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A clinical overview of WT1 gene mutations. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>43</offset><text>Mutations in the WT1 gene were anticipated to explain the genetic basis of the childhood kidney cancer , Wilms tumour ( WT ) .

Retinoblastoma appears to conform to the simple two-step model first proposed by Knudson. The gene responsible for RB, now called Rb1, has been located in chromosome region 13q14. The Rb1 gene has been cloned and subjected to extensive analysis. It is probable that the Rb1 gene product has a role in the regulation of transcription. The familial form of RB occurs as the result of a germline mutation of one of the copies of the Rb1 gene. Colorectal cancer, in contrast, appears to be the result of four or five steps involving both activation of oncogenes and inactivation of antioncogenes. The FAP gene has been located in chromosome region 5q21 by genetic linkage, and a candidate gene, MCC (mutated in colon cancer), has been cloned. Other mutations in previously-identified genes that have been identified as important in the genesis of CRC include the activation of p53 and of Ki-ras. A gene lying in chromosome region 18q which is deleted in colorectal cancer, and hence named DCC has been cloned. Its protein product has sequence homology to neural cell adhesion molecules and other related cell-surface glycoproteins. Delineation of the genes involved in the development of tumours such as RB and CRC provides insight into the mechanisms by which sequential mutations result in carcinogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>648</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical case report atypical myopathy in a young girl with 91 CTG repeats in DM1 locus and a positive DM1 family history.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant inheritable disease associated with an expansion of CTG repeats in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene.

Sixteen FAP families with 139 members have been evaluated. Fifty-eight members are affected and 81 are at risk or unaffected. Those who have been screened positive have a much lower risk of cancer (13%) compared with those who presented with the disease (89%) and death from colorectal cancer in the corresponding groups were nil and 58%. Eight HNPCC families with 36 affected and 170 at-risk members have been registered. Colonoscopic surveillance have just started: one case of Dukes' A cancer in a 26 year-old patient, and two cases with polyps have been diagnosed. Advances in molecular genetics and the identification of APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) gene in the FAP locus of Chromosome 5 have made it possible to diagnose FAP genetically. This has important impact on management in terms of prenatal diagnosis and dietary and chemoprevention programmes in addition to surgical intervention.</text></passage></document><document><id>654</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutant forms of erythrocyte glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in Ashkenazi.

In the best-characterized cases, this primary mutation is a loss of function mutation consistent with viability but resulting in neoplastic change consequent to the acquisition of a second somatic mutation at the same locus. Such genes are referred to as tumor-suppressor genes. Classical examples are the Rb-1 gene associated with the development of retinoblastoma and the p53 gene, which is associated with a wider range of neoplasms, including breast cancer. Other tumor-suppressor genes have been isolated which are associated with Wilms' tumor, neurofibromatosis, and inherited and sporadic forms of colorectal cancer. Some of these genes appear to act as negative regulators of mitotic cycle genes, and others may have different properties. The nature of these genes is discussed, as is the evidence for the involvement of tumor-suppressor genes in other inherited, and sporadic, forms of cancer. Some recent data on the Wilms' tumor gene, WT1, and on the involvement of the p53 gene in breast cancer are presented, and the importance of genomic imprinting in contributing to the excess of suppressor gene mutations in chromosomes of paternal origin is considered.</text></passage></document><document><id>656</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Molecular biology in genetic counseling of Duchenne and Becker myopathy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>From 1985-1991, molecular biology studies were carried out in 115 families affected with X-linked muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD), including 59 prenatal diagnoses. The approach has changed over the last 6 years when new intragenic markers and cDNA probes became available. The polymerase chain reaction technique allows a rapid detection of dystrophin deletions, but classical Southern blot technique remains useful for restriction length polymorphism analysis. Fifty percent (42/85) of patients with DMD/BMD exhibited deletions of the dystrophin gene. In affected families with a detectable deletion, carrier detection is possible by gene dosage analysis and prenatal diagnosis is reliable. When no deletion is found, carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis depends on linkage analysis using polymorphic probes. Due to the high recombination rate, several markers need to be used. The information provided by linkage analysis must be interpreted given the proper family structure.</text></passage></document><document><id>657</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Periodic disease of the child].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>33</offset><text>Familial mediterranean fever is a childhood disease which usually starts around the age of 4 years.

The expression of the antigen recognized by mAb CZ-1 is restricted mostly to cells of the lymphoid lineage. The antigen is expressed on 10%-25% of bone marrow cells and 3%-5% of thymocytes. Analysis of thymocyte subpopulations indicates expression of the CZ-1 antigen on 100% of the NK1.1+, 27% of the CD4-CD8-, 1.1% of the CD4+CD8+, 1.1% of the CD4+CD8-, and 33% of the CD4-CD8+ cells. In the spleen, the CZ-1 antigen is expressed on B lymphocytes, NK cells, and virtually all CD8+ T lymphocytes. Most unstimulated CD4+ splenic T lymphocytes, monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, with the notable exception of basophils, do not react with mAb CZ-1. CD4+ T cells activated in vivo by virus infection or in vitro by anti-CD3 and interleukin-2 express the CZ-1 antigen. These results indicate that mAb CZ-1 identifies a novel inducible lymphocyte activation/differentiation antigen that distinguishes between thymic and unstimulated splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. This mAb will be a useful tool in the identification of lymphocyte subpopulations and in the study of the ontogeny and activation of these cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>659</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Structure and organization of the human transglutaminase 1 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Membrane-associated transglutaminases (TGase1) have recently been found to be common in mammalian cells, but it is not clear whether these derive from the same or different genes. In order to determine the complexity of this system, we have isolated and characterized the human gene (TGM1). The gene of 14,133 base pairs was found to contain 15 exons spliced by 14 introns. Interestingly, the positions of these introns have been conserved in comparison with the genes of two other transglutaminase-like activities described in the literature, but the TGM1 gene is by far the smallest characterized to date because its introns are relatively smaller. On the other hand, the TGase1 enzyme is the largest known transglutaminase (about 90 kDa), apparently because its gene acquired tracts that encode additional sequences on its amino and carboxyl termini that confer its unique properties. Southern blot analyses of total human genomic DNA cut with several restriction enzymes reveal only one band. Use of human-rodent cell hybrid panels and chromosomal in situ hybridization with biotin-labeled probes revealed that the human TGM1 gene maps to chromosome position 14q11.2-13. Such data suggest there is a single gene copy per haploid human genome. Comparisons of sequence identities and homologies indicate that the transglutaminase family of genes arose by duplications and subsequent divergent evolution from a common ancestor but later became scattered in the human genome. Although our present Southern blot and chromosomal localization studies revealed no restriction fragment length polymorphisms, comparisons of published sequences and our genomic clone indicate there are two sequence variants for TGase1 within the human population. The rare smaller variant contains a two-nucleotide deletion near the 5'-end, uses an alternate initiation codon, and differs from the common larger variant only in the first 15 amino acids. Furthermore, the DNA sequences of intron 14 possess several tracts of dinucleotide repeats that by polymerase chain reaction analysis show wide size polymorphism within the human population. Accordingly, this gene system constitutes a useful polymorphic marker for genetic linkage analyses.</text></passage></document><document><id>660</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Correction of sulfatide metabolism after transfer of prosaposin cDNA to cultured cells from a patient with SAP-1 deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>The lysosomal removal of the sulfate moiety from sulfatide requires the action of two proteins, arylsulfatase A and sphingolipid activator protein-1 (SAP-1). Recently, patients have been identified who have a variant form of metachromatic leukodystrophy which is characterized by mutations in the gene coding for SAP-1, which is also called "prosaposin." All of the mutations characterized in these patients result in (a) deficient mature SAP-1, as determined by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE of tissue and cell extracts, and (b) decreased ability of cultured skin fibroblasts to metabolize endocytosed [14C]-sulfatide. We now report the insertion of the full-length prosaposin cDNA into the Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vector, pLJ, and the infection of cultured skin fibroblasts from a newly diagnosed and molecularly characterized patient with SAP-1 deficiency. The cultured cells infected with the prosaposin cDNA construct now show both production of normal levels of mature SAP-1 and completely normal metabolism of endocytosed [14C]-sulfatide. These studies demonstrate that the virally transferred prosaposin cDNA is processed normally and is localized within lysosomes, where it is needed for interaction between sulfatide and arylsulfatase A. In addition, normal as well as mutant sequences can now be found by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA by using exonic sequences as primers.</text></passage></document><document><id>661</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variation at fibrinogen loci and plasma fibrinogen levels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset><text>In view of the controversy regarding genetic variation at the fibrinogen loci and plasma fibrinogen levels, we have analysed DNA polymorphisms at the alpha (TaqI), beta (BclI and HaeIII), and gamma (KpnI/SacI) fibrinogen loci in 247 subjects whose plasma fibrinogen was determined by clotting and nephelometric assays.

The symptomatic female carriers had no deletions but had abnormal dystrophin distribution in the sarcolemma (discontinuous immunostains). The following diagnoses were made for the remaining cases without deletions with the aid of a muscle biopsy: spinal muscular atrophy, congenital myopathy; sarcoglycan deficiency and unclassified limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.

When recombination occurs within the DMD gene, or DNA analysis is uninformative, or in pedigrees where it is unclear whether or not the consultand is a carrier, direct examination of muscle by dystrophin analysis may provide the only means of prenatal diagnosis. We present three cases representing each of these molecular genetic diagnostic dilemmas. In each instance, we used sonographically guided fetal muscle biopsy for dystrophin protein analysis to resolve the dilemma. In the first and third cases, the presence of normal dystrophin was shown by immunofluorescence and this was followed by delivery of an unaffected male fetus. In the second case, dystrophin was not found in fetal muscle tissue implying that this fetus was affected. The absence of dystrophin and affected status was confirmed in skeletal and cardiac muscle obtained after pregnancy termination.</text></passage></document><document><id>686</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa: a novel mutation at the peripherin/RDS locus in the original 6p-linked pedigree.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>Using single-strand conformation polymorphism electrophoresis, heteroduplex analysis, and direct sequencing, we have searched for possible disease-causing mutations in the adRP family in which we originally found tight linkage of the disease to 6p.

Both the phenylketonuric offspring and her nonphenylketonuric sib were microcephalic at birth and had congenital anomalies, esophageal atresia in the former and congenital dislocation of the hip in the latter. However, the phenylketonuric child also had intrauterine growth retardation while the nonphenylketonuric sib had normal weight and length at birth. Both children are mentally retarded with an IQ below 50 in the phenylketonuric child despite early dietary treatment for PKU and an IQ of 54 in the nonphenylketonuric sib. Both children also have hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and enlarged cerebral ventricles. This experience and review of the literature indicates that the residual liver phenylalanine hydroxylase activity of a nonphenylketonuric fetus offers little or no protection from damage in untreated maternal PKU. Consequently, the outcome in maternal PKU is likely to depend on control of the maternal biochemical abnormalities in the mother regardless of whether the fetus has or does not have PKU.</text></passage></document><document><id>692</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Electro-oculography in autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>Thirteen members of a family presumed to be harboring the gene for autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy were examined.

In order to inherit the differential epigenetic imprints from one generation to the next, these imprints have to be erased in the primordial germ cells and re-established in a sex-specific manner during gametogenesis. The exact timing of the imprint resetting is not yet known and the use of immature gametes in assisted reproductive technologies may therefore lead to abnormal imprinting and related diseases. Imprinting is associated with differential allelic methylation in a CpG-context. We studied the methylation patterns of the imprint control (IC) region of the human SNRPN-gene in human spermatozoa, oocytes in different developmental stages [germinal vesicle (GV), metaphase I and metaphase II oocytes] and in preimplantation embryos using the bisulphite sequencing technique. In the spermatozoa, almost all potential methylation sites were unmethylated whereas mainly methylated patterns were found in the oocytes at different developmental stages. In the embryos, an average methylation pattern of 53% was found indicating that the imprints, which have been set during gametogenesis, are stably maintained in the preimplantation embryo. Our results indicate that the maternal imprints for the IC-region of the human SNRPN-gene are already re-established at the GV stage and that they are not re-established in a late oocyte stage or after fertilization as previously reported. Recent advances in assisted reproductive technologies raise questions concerning safety and the epigenetic risks involved. Our study was the first to check the methylation imprints in human pre-implantation embryos and oocytes at different developmental stages.</text></passage></document><document><id>695</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Immunohistochemical characteristics defined by tissue microarray of hereditary breast cancer not attributable to BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations: differences from breast carcinomas arising in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>220</offset><text>PURPOSE: Most familial breast cancers are not associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 germ-line mutations. Therefore, it is of major importance to define the morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of this group of tumors to improve genetic testing and also gain further insight into the biological characteristics of tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the morphological characteristics of 37 tumors arising in women without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, 20 tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers, and 18 from BRCA2 mutation carriers, all of which were from index patients from breast cancer families. In addition, a tissue microarray was constructed with all tumoral samples to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of a wide panel of antibodies (11 antibodies) and the amplification of HER-2 and c-MYC genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization. An age-matched group with 50 sporadic breast cancers as controls for non-BRCA1/2 was also included. RESULTS: Non-BRCA1/2 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDCs) showed specific differences from BRCA1 tumors. They were of lower grade (1 and 2); more frequently estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, BCL2 positive, and p53 negative; had a low proliferation rate (Ki-67 immunostaining &lt; 5%); and did not express P-cadherin. With respect to BRCA2 IDCs and control group, non-BRCA1/2 tumors were of lower grade and had a lower proliferation rate. No cases of HER-2 amplification and/or overexpression were observed except in the control group ( approximately 20%). In contrast, c-MYC amplification was present in 18.2, 62.5, and 12.5% of BRCA1, BRCA2, and non-BRCA1/2 IDCs, respectively, and 31% in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study thus reveals distinct morphological and immunohistochemical features in non-BRCA1/2 and BRCA1 tumors, whereas BRCA2 tumors present characteristics intermediate between the two phenotypes. In addition, the study also demonstrates the usefulness of tissue microarray technology in the evaluation of the immunophenotypic features of hereditary breast cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>696</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Maple syrup urine disease in the Austronesian aboriginal tribe Paiwan of Taiwan: a novel DBT (E2) gene 4.7 kb founder deletion caused by a nonhomologous recombination between LINE-1 and Alu and the carrier-frequency determination.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>231</offset><text>Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error disorder derived from the accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine and valine.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel E2 gene 4.7 kb deletion as a rare nonhomologous recombination of the long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (LINE-1) in intron 10 and the Alu in the 3' UTR of the E2 gene from three classic MSUD patients of the Austronesian aboriginal tribe Paiwan in Taiwan. The E2 gene 4.7 kb deletion accounted for five out of six alleles in the three unrelated Paiwanese MSUD patients, indicating a founder effect. Carrier-frequency study revealed one deleted heterozygote out of 101 normal Paiwanese. As the nine Taiwanese Austronesian aboriginal tribes share a common origin, this E2 4.7 kb deletion may be preserved in some of the other Austronesian aboriginal tribes of Taiwan. This is the first comprehensive genetics study of MSUD in the Austronesian tribal groups as well as in Taiwan.</text></passage></document><document><id>697</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic heterogeneity of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, due to TWIST and FGFR mutations. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>Thirty-two unrelated patients with features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome , a common autosomal dominant condition of craniosynostosis and limb anomalies , were screened for mutations in TWIST , FGFR2 , and FGFR3 .

A CCG triplet, located in the 5' untranslated region of the FRAXE gene undergoes expansion and methylation in these patients, eliminating detectable gene transcription. FRAXE syndrome is distinct from fragile X syndrome, a more common genetic form of mental retardation caused by expansion and methylation of a similar repeat in the FMR1 gene located 600 kb proximal to FRAXE. FRAXE syndrome is rare, and patients' phenotypes are highly variable, leading to difficulties with predicting specific FMR2 functions based on the human disease. Recently, Lilliputian(Lilli), a Drosophila FMR2 orthologue, was identified; this gene has been linked with several signal transduction pathways, including the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway, the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the P13K/PKB pathway. Mutation of Lilli shows defects in germinal band extension, cytoskeletal structure, cell growth, and organ development. The Lilli gene suggests possible functions for FMR2 (and related genes) in humans and mice, but cannot predict specific functions. Modeling FMR2 mutation in the mouse will be useful to understand specific functions of this gene in vertebrates. This review presents what has been learned thus far from the FMR2 knockout mouse model and suggests future studies on this model in order to compare it with the human FRAXE mental retardation disorder, Lilli mutants in Drosophila and other mouse models of genes in this family.</text></passage></document><document><id>699</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Neuropathogenic forms of huntingtin and androgen receptor inhibit fast axonal transport.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>Huntington's and Kennedy's disease are autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases caused by pathogenic expansion of polyglutamine tracts.

Here we show that polypeptides containing expanded polyglutamine tracts, but not normal N-terminal huntingtin or androgen receptor, directly inhibit both fast axonal transport in isolated axoplasm and elongation of neuritic processes in intact cells.

A genetic variant of APC, I1307K, results from a T-to-A transversion at nucleotide 3920 which converts the wild-type sequence to a homopolymer tract (A(8)). The I1307K alteration is not itself oncogenic, but creates a hypermutable region (A(8)) that is prone to frame-shift mutations. The APC I1307K variant occurs in approximately 6% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population and is reported to approximately double an individual's risk for colorectal cancer. Here we describe a single nucleotide primer extension assay for the detection of the APC I1307K mutation. Following PCR amplification, nucleotide 3920 of the APC gene is directly sequenced using single nucleotide primer extension technology. The assay is in a multiplex format allowing simultaneous forward and reverse sequencing of the I1307K variant, which provides an internal, independent confirmation of each testing result. The assay was validated against 60 samples previously characterized by an allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization assay, with 100% concordance of results. Compared to the ASO assay, this single nucleotide primer extension assay requires significantly less technical time to perform, and has a greatly increased throughput capacity. The single nucleotide extension assay provides a highly sensitive and specific assay to identify individuals with the APC I1307K gene variant who may benefit from increased colorectal screening.</text></passage></document><document><id>704</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A macular hole in a female adult with bilateral coats disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset><text>PURPOSE: To report a case of a macular hole in a female adult with bilateral Coats disease.

In contrast to its DNA counterpart that forms a complex mixture of hairpins and tetraplexes, r(CGG)22 forms a single stable hairpin with no evidence for any other folded structure even at low pH. RNA with the sequence (CGG)9AGG (CGG)12AGG(CGG)97, found in a fragile X syndrome pre-mutation allele, forms a number of different hairpins. The most prominent hairpin forms in the 3' part of the repeat and involves the 97 uninterrupted CGG repeats. In contrast to the CUG-RNA hairpins formed by myotonic dystrophy type 1 repeats, we found no evidence that CGG-RNA hairpins activate PKR, the interferon-inducible protein kinase that is activated by a wide range of double-stranded RNAs. However, we do show that the CGG-RNA is digested, albeit inefficiently, by the human Dicer enzyme, a step central to the RNA interference effect on gene expression. These data provide clues to the basis of the toxic effect of CGG-RNA that is thought to occur in fragile X pre-mutation carriers. In addition, RNA hairpins may also account for the stalling of the 40S ribosomal subunit that is thought to contribute to the translation deficit in fragile X pre-mutation and full mutation alleles.</text></passage></document><document><id>706</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Phosphopeptide binding specificities of BRCA1 COOH-terminal (BRCT) domains.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>Protein phosphorylation by protein kinases may generate docking sites for other proteins. It thus allows the assembly of signaling complexes in response to kinase activation. Several protein domains that bind phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues have been identified, including the 14-3-3, PIN1, FHA, KIX, WD-40 domain, and polo box (Yaffe, M. B., and Elia, A. E. (2001) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 13, 131-138; Elia, A. E., Cantley, L. C., and Yaffe, M. B. (2003) Science 299, 1228-1231). The BRCA1 COOH-terminal (BRCT) domains are protein modules found in many proteins that regulate DNA damage responses (Koonin, E. V., Altschul, S. F., and Bork, P. (1996) Nat. Genet. 13, 266-268). Whether BRCT domains can mediate phosphorylation-dependent interactions has not been systematically investigated. We report here that the BRCT domains also recognize phosphopeptides. Oriented peptide library analysis indicated that the BRCT domains from BRCA1, MDC1, BARD1, and DNA Ligase IV preferred distinct phosphoserine-containing peptides. In addition, the interaction between BRCA1 and the BRCT binding motif of BACH1 was required for BACH1 checkpoint activity. Furthermore, BRCT domains of the yeast DNA repair protein Rad9 could bind phosphopeptides, suggesting that the BRCT domains represent a class of ancient phosphopeptide-binding modules. Potential targets of BRCT domains were identified through data base search. Structural analysis of BRCA1 BRCT repeats also predicted conserved residues that may form the phosphopeptide-binding pocket. Thus, the BRCT repeats are a new family of phosphopeptide-binding domains in DNA damage responses.</text></passage></document><document><id>707</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Effects of atorvastatin and pravastatin on malondialdehyde-modified LDL in hypercholesterolemic patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>106</offset><text>The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of atorvastatin and pravastatin on lipid parameters and the concentration of malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) in hypercholesterolemic patients. A total of 17 patients (10 men, 7 women; mean age, 68+/-9 years) who were indicated for drug therapy based on the National Cholesterol Education Program II underwent an 8-week regimen of atorvastatin (10 mg/day) or pravastatin (10 mg/day) with a 4-week washout period between drugs. After an overnight fast, lipid parameters and MDA-LDL concentration were measured before and after the 8-week treatment with each drug. Both atorvastatin and pravastatin produced significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and MDA-LDL concentrations, with a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The percent reductions in LDL cholesterol and MDA-LDL concentration were significantly greater with atorvastatin than pravastatin (46 +/-6% vs 24+/-10%, p&lt;0.0001, and 44+/-10% vs 14+/-13%, p&lt;0.0001, respectively). The ratios of percent reductions in MDA-LDL concentrations and percent reductions in LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly greater for atorvastatin than pravastatin (0.96+/-0.19 vs 0.59+/-0.55, p&lt;0.0001). In conclusion, atorvastatin reduced serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol and MDA-LDL to a greater degree than pravastatin, indicating that atorvastatin not only has stronger lipid-lowering effects, but also stronger antioxidative effects than pravastatin.</text></passage></document><document><id>708</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever mutation frequencies and carrier rates among a mixed Arabic population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory periodic disorder characterized by febrile and painful attacks due to inflammation involving the serosal membranes. The gene implicated in this disorder, MEFV, has been cloned and mutations in its coding regions have been identified. We aimed at identifying the frequency of MEFV mutations and carrier frequency in a mixed Arabic population. METHODS: We identified 29 probands from 29 unrelated sibships segregating the disorder and representing the affected individual cohort. We screened 200 anonymous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples, representing a healthy adult cohort, for the mutations found to be common in the affected individual cohort. We also, screened anonymous DNA samples from 4 Arabic countries, namely, Egypt (231), Syria (225), Iraq (176) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (107) thus enlarging our healthy adult cohort. The study was carried out between 1999 and 2002 at Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid and the University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan. RESULTS: Out of the 58 alleles of the 29 probands, only 31 mutations were identified and M694V and V726A are the most common. The mutation E148Q was the most common among the healthy adult cohort, but was not present in affected individuals. The collective mutant allele frequency "q" was 0.101. The expected carrier rate was 18.1% (one in 5.5) while the observed carrier rate was 18.4% (one in 5.4). CONCLUSION: E148Q has reduced penetrance and thus, a proportion of the individuals genetically affected with FMF remain asymptomatic. M694I and M680I are more prevalent in the affected individuals cohort, which points to their higher penetrance. The overall carrier rate is one in 5, but the selective heterozygote advantage could not be demonstrated in this study due to the relatively small sample size.</text></passage></document><document><id>709</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mouse model of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase deficiency (Galns-/-) produced by targeted disruption of the gene defective in Morquio A disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>155</offset><text>Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS), a lysosomal enzyme required for the stepwise degradation of keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S).

In the brain, hippocampal and neocortical neurons and meningeal cells had lysosomal storage. KS and C6S were more abundant in the cytoplasm of corneal epithelial cells of Galns-/- mice compared with wild-type mice by immunohistochemistry. Radiographs revealed no change in the skeletal bones of mice up to 12 months old. Thus, targeted disruption of the murine Galns gene has produced a murine model, which shows visceral storage of GAGs but lacks the skeletal features. The complete absence of GALNS in mutant mice makes them useful for studies of pharmacokinetics and tissue targeting of recombinant GALNS designed for enzyme replacement.</text></passage></document><document><id>710</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cholestanol metabolism, molecular pathology, and nutritional implications.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>Cholestanol, not cholesterol, is a minor component in the human body and in foods, but an increase in cholestanol concentration in serum induces a pathological condition named cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). In our investigation of this disease for more than 25 years, a procedure for quantification of cholestanol by high-performance liquid chromatography and an assay method for sterol 27-hydroxylase were established, and several mutations of the CYP 27 gene in 10 CTX families were identified. We also established experimental animal models with symptoms of CTX by feeding a high cholestanol diet. Corneal dystrophy and gallstones were produced in mice, and an apoptosis of cerebellar neuronal cells was observed in rats. We propose the following underlying mechanism of CTX pathogenesis: When cholesterol in the plasma membrane is replaced by cholestanol to some extent, the membrane fluidity is reduced, and the calcium channel fails to open, inducing cell death. CTX patients are treated with oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid, which reduces the cholestanol concentration in serum. Cholestanol has a toxic effect, and an imbalance of the cholesterol/cholestanol ratio in plasma membrane is suspected to cause the disturbance of calcium channel function of the membrane.</text></passage></document><document><id>711</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Helicobacter pylori stimulates host vascular endothelial growth factor-A (vegf-A) gene expression via MEK/ERK-dependent activation of Sp1 and Sp3.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>147</offset><text>VEGF-A is a key regulator of inflammatory and tumor-associated angiogenesis. H. pylori plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of benign and malignant gastric diseases. It has been suggested that H. pylori infection is associated with activation of host angiogenesis, however, underlying mechanisms as well as angiogenic growth factors activated by the bacterium have not yet been identified. Therefore, we investigated the influence of the bacterium on VEGF-A as a candidate host target gene in vivo and in vitro. We show that H. pylori potently up-regulates production and release of VEGF-A protein as well as vegf-A mRNA levels, and we provide strong evidence that enhanced recruitment of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to two proximal GC-rich vegf-A promoter elements mediates H. pylori-triggered vegf-A gene expression. In addition, H. pylori infection increased the transactivating capacity of both Sp1 and Sp3, which suggests additional mechanism(s) of vegf-A gene regulation by the bacterium. Signaling studies identified the MEK>ERK1/-2 kinase cascade as principal host signaling pathway mediating H. pylori-stimulated vegf-A transcription. By identifying H. pylori as potent activator of vegf-A gene expression and characterization of underlying molecular mechanisms, our results provide novel insights into pathways linking the bacterium to host angiogenesis and may help to develop strategies to influence vegf-A gene expression in the setting of H. pylori infection.</text></passage></document><document><id>712</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genomic scan of 254 hereditary prostate cancer families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>57</offset><text>Hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, complicating efforts to map and clone susceptibility loci. We have used stratification of a large dataset of 254 HPC families in an effort to improve power to detect HPC loci and to understand what types of family features may improve locus identification. The strongest result is that of a dominant locus at 6p22.3 (heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) = 2.51), the evidence for which is increased by consideration of the age of PC onset (HLOD = 3.43 in 214 families with median age-of-onset 56-72 years) and co-occurrence of primary brain cancer (HLOD = 2.34 in 21 families) in the families. Additional regions for which we observe modest evidence for linkage include chromosome 7q and 17p. Only weak evidence of several previously implicated HPC regions is detected. These analyses support the existence of multiple HPC loci, whose presence may be best identified by analyses of large, including pooled, datasets which consider locus heterogeneity.</text></passage></document><document><id>713</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) gene mutations and phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) and X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), characterized by chronic microthrombocytopenia with and without immunodeficiency, are caused by mutations of the WAS protein (WASP) gene. WASP has been reported to interact with many cytoplasmic molecules linking cellular signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. In this review we will focus on recent molecular findings that provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this complex disease and explore the correlation of genotype and clinical phenotype. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent investigations have provided evidence that WASP and several related proteins are involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by activating Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. This function is controlled mainly by a small GTPase Cdc42. Activated GTP-bound Cdc42 dissociates the intramolecular autoinhibitory loop formation of WASP. In addition, WASP is involved in cytoplasmic signaling by its interaction with a variety of adaptor molecules or kinases and serves as a link to actin reorganization, which is important for immunological synapse formation, cell trafficking and motility. Tyrosine or serine phosphorylation of WASP increases the actin polymerization activity of WASP via Arp2/3. Mutation analysis of WAS/XLT patients has provided evidence for a strong correlation between phenotype and genotype. Gene therapy for WASP-deficient human lymphocytes and Wasp-deficient mice was performed successfully. SUMMARY: The study of WASP and its mutations has led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the syndrome (thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, atopic dermatitis, autoimmune and malignant diseases) and the mechanisms required for cell mobility, cell-cell interaction and cytoplasmic signaling, as well as thrombopoiesis and maintenance of the number of platelets.</text></passage></document><document><id>714</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Differing effects of breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) mutations on cellular responses to ionizing radiation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>153</offset><text>PURPOSE: The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene encodes a protein kinase, the activation of which is an early event in the cellular response to ionizing radiation. One of the many substrates of ATM is BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset gene), which has been associated with susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, and has been implicated in DNA repair processes. Various cellular responses to radiation were analysed in cells with mutations in ATM or BRCA1 in an attempt to clarify which effects of ATM can be mediated through BRCA1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The response to radiation of cells with mutations in ATM or BRCA1 was examined, as were BRCA1-mutant tumour cells transfected with an exogenous wild-type BRCA1 allele. Assays included cell-survival curves, studies of potentially lethal damage repair, measurement of chromosomal aberrations and of G1 arrest, and Western blot analysis of lysates of irradiated cells to determine the phosphorylation of the product of the human Mdm2 gene (HDM2). RESULTS: Both ATM and BRCA1 mutations were associated with sensitivity to ionizing radiation, deficient repair of potentially lethal damage and markedly increased chromosomal aberrations. A BRCA1-mutated tumour cell line HCC1937, like ATM mutant cells, did not exhibit a normal G1 arrest but, unlike ATM mutant cells, did exhibit phosphorylation of HDM2. Expression of wild-type BRCA1 in HCC1937 cells partially restored radioresistance, restored repair of potentially lethal damage and markedly reduced radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations. G1 arrest, however, was not restored by expression of BRCA1. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with a model in which ATM phosphorylation of BRCA1 regulates DNA repair functions, particularly those involved in potentially lethal damage repair and chromosomal integrity, but not other aspects of the cellular response to radiation such as G1 cell cycle arrest. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the ability of exogenously expressed BRCA1 to restore the ability to perform potentially lethal damage repair and maintain chromosomal integrity in irradiated cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>715</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Ethnic variations of a retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) polymorphism in eight Asian populations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>An A --> G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at nucleotide 153,104 in the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (RB1) at 13q14 was previously reported to be present only in Asians.

Free fatty acid and acyl carnitine analyses using dried blood spots, and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity assays using cultured skin fibroblasts established a diagnosis of very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. Currently VLCAD deficiency has been divided into three phenotypes; a severe childhood form, a milder childhood form, and an adult form. However, we suggest that the severe and milder childhood forms would be better described as a systemic form, and the adult form and our infant case as a myopathic form. An early onset of the myopathic form within the first year of life, as well as its diagnosis in early infancy, has never been described in the literature.</text></passage></document><document><id>717</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Impact of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene on maternal phenylketonuria outcome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine to what extent maternal and offspring phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotypes in conjunction with maternal IQ and dietary control during pregnancy are related to cognitive development in offspring of women with phenylketonuria (PKU). METHODS: PAH gene mutations were determined in 196 maternal PKU subjects and their offspring. The women were grouped according to PAH genotype, which predicts the metabolic phenotype (severe PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). IQ was determined in both the mothers (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised at >18 years) and their children (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised at > or = 6-7 years of age). RESULTS: According to PAH genotypes, 62% of the women exhibited severe PKU, 19% exhibited mild PKU, and 19% exhibited MHP. Maternal IQ increased, and the assigned phenylalanine (Phe) levels decreased with decreasing severity of PAH genotype. In offspring of mild maternal PKU, multiple regression analysis showed offspring IQ to be significantly related to maternal IQ but not to Phe exposure during pregnancy, which was &lt;750 micromol/L in all cases of mild PKU. In offspring of mothers with severe PKU and average Phe exposure during pregnancy of 360 to 750 micromol/L, multiple regression analysis revealed both maternal IQ and Phe exposure to be significant predictors of offspring IQ. When average Phe exposure was &lt;360 micromol/L, cognitive development was normal (mean IQ: 105), whereas an average Phe exposure of >750 micromol/L severely depressed offspring IQ (mean IQ: 56) in this group regardless of maternal IQ. It could not be documented that the offspring PAH genotype affects cognitive development. CONCLUSION: Female individuals with severe PKU should be offered a diet for a lifetime. If good metabolic control is established, then women with PKU will have children with IQ scores that are not influenced by their disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>718</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Temperature-dependent, irreversible formation of amyloid fibrils by a soluble human ataxin-3 carrying a moderately expanded polyglutamine stretch (Q36).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>153</offset><text>The protein ataxin-3 is responsible for Machado-Joseph disease/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the presence of an expanded polyglutamine tract.

U.S.A. 98, 11955-11960] showed that a nonexpanded ataxin-3 (Q27) was fully soluble, whereas an expanded form (Q78) gave rise to amyloid fibrils. Here, we report investigations on three forms of ataxin-3 (i.e., human nonexpanded (Q26), moderately expanded (Q36) ataxins-3, and the murine protein (Q6)). Far-UV circular dichroism spectra at room temperature were substantially similar, with a relatively high helical content. On heating to 96 degrees C, human Q26 and murine proteins did not display large structural changes, nor did they undergo any precipitation, which highlights their amazing heat-resistance. In contrast, human Q36 ataxin-3 underwent a progressive increase in the beta-sheet and a concomitant decrease in helical content when the temperature was shifted from 37 to 80 degrees C, followed by the irreversible formation of aggregates above 80 degrees C. They were shown to consist of amyloid fibrils, as supported by both electron microscopy images and the typical spectral shift displayed by Congo red when it was added to the protein at growing temperatures. We also found that protein precipitation could be prevented by mixing the dye with Q36 ataxin-3 prior to heating, which also confirms that the precipitates do represent authentic amyloid fibrils. In contrast, other compounds structurally related to Congo red did not exert significant effects. Our observations suggest that the temperature of the observed transition is inversely related to the length of the expansion. Finally, we suggest that antiamyloidogenic compounds might be selected on the basis of their ability to block or retard human Q36 ataxin-3 precipitation on heat-treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>719</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Persistent phenotypic correction of central diabetes insipidus using adeno-associated virus vector expressing arginine-vasopressin in Brattleboro rats.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>152</offset><text>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector is suitable for gene transfer to the central nervous system. However, the efficacy of gene therapy for neuroendocrine disease is still unknown. In this study, we injected AAV vector encoding arginine-vasopressin (AVP) stereotaxically into the bilateral hypothalamus of Brattleboro rats. Brattleboro rats show a central diabetes insipidus (CDI) phenotype and growth retardation due to a complete deficiency of AVP. Following injection, both urine volume and urine osmolality normalized, and these therapeutic effects persisted for more than 50 weeks. In addition to phenotypic correction, secretion of transgene-derived AVP was enhanced after 24 h water deprivation or hypertonic saline injection, and water diuresis was demonstrated after acute water loading. Also, reduced body weight and low plasma insulin-like growth factor I levels of Brattleboro rats were restored after AVP gene transduction, suggesting the importance of AVP in growth. These findings indicate that hypothalamic neurons of Brattleboro rats can produce and release mature AVP following AAV-mediated gene transduction, resulting in long-term phenotypic correction of CDI. Moreover, the fact that transgene-derived AVP was secreted adequately in response to stimuli, even if it was expressed constitutively, suggests advantages of gene therapy for neuroendocrine diseases and offers a basis to investigate AVP function.</text></passage></document><document><id>720</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Tumor suppression and apoptosis of human prostate carcinoma mediated by a genetic locus within human chromosome 10pter-q11. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the United States .

Sequencing of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene showed a point mutation IVS4 + 1 G-->A within the donor splice site of intron 4. We identified one transcript with a deletion of exon 4 (Deltaex4, 169bp) encoding for PLP and DM20 proteins and lacking two transmembrane domains, and a second transcript with exon 4 + 10bp encoding three transmembrane domains. Immunohistochemistry showed abnormal aggregation in the myelin sheath of MBP and P0. Myelin-associated glycoprotein was present in the Schmidt-Lanterman clefts but significantly reduced in the periaxonal region. Using immunogold electron microscopy, we demonstrated the presence of mutated PLP/DM20 and the absence of the intact protein in the patient peripheral myelin sheath. We conclude that insertion of mutant PLP/DM20 with resulting aberrant distribution of other myelin proteins in peripheral nerve may constitute an important mechanism of dysmyelination in disorders associated with PLP mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>722</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A cardiac sodium channel mutation identified in Brugada syndrome associated with atrial standstill.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Mutations in the cardiac Na+ channel gene SCN5A are responsible for multiple lethal ventricular arrhythmias including Brugada syndrome and congenital long QT syndrome.

Deletion of either mdm2 or mdm4 genes, which encode p53 inhibitors, results in embryonic lethality. The lethal phenotypes are rescued in the absence of p53, which indicates that increased activity of p53 is the cause of lethality in the mdm2- and mdm4-null embryos. Here we show that mdm2-null embryos die because of apoptosis initiated at 3.5 days postcoitum (dpc). Partial rescue of mdm2-null embryos by deletion of bax allows survival to 6.5 dpc and alters the mechanism of death from apoptosis to cell cycle arrest, indicating that bax is a critical component of the p53 pathway in early embryogenesis. The death of mdm4-null embryos is due to p53-initiated cell cycle arrest at 7.5 dpc. Deletion of p21(p21(waf1/cip1)), a p53 downstream target partially responsible for cell cycle arrest, does not rescue this phenotype; however, deletion of p21 alters the mechanism of cell death from lack of proliferation to apoptosis. Thus, in both examples, deletion of a p53 downstream target gene allows p53 to redirect its efforts, highlighting a high degree of plasticity in p53 function.</text></passage></document><document><id>724</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Somatic mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau disease gene in renal carcinomas occurring in patients with long-term dialysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) frequently occurs in patients with long-term dialysis. Long-term dialysis causes distinctive pathological changes in the kidney, which is known as acquired cystic disease of the kidney (ACDK). It is of great interest to know whether RCCs occurring in the dialytic kidneys harbour the same or similar mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene as conventional dialysis-unrelated clear cell RCCs so often do. METHODS: Renal cancer tissues (eight clear cell, two papillary, one Bellini duct and three of the so-called dialysis-specific renal carcinomas) from 13 patients undergoing long-term dialysis were examined for somatic mutations of the VHL disease gene. By means of laser capture microdissection, cancerous and surrounding non-cancerous renal tissues from dialytic patients were subjected to PCR-based direct sequencing of the VHL gene. RESULTS: Direct forward and reverse sequencing showed that three tumours possessed VHL gene mutations (713delG, 500-504del5-bp and 709A>G). These three mutations were identified in clear cell carcinomas occurring in association with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis for 194, 147 and 125 months. None of the non-tumour tissues or other carcinoma tissues analysed, including dialysis-specific carcinoma, possessed VHL gene mutations. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that VHL tumour-suppressor gene mutation is involved in clear cell carcinoma in association with long-term dialysis. Mutation of the VHL gene was not found in any of the dialysis-specific RCCs studied herein.</text></passage></document><document><id>725</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>DGGE-based whole-gene mutation scanning of the dystrophin gene in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) are caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Large rearrangements in the gene are found in about two-thirds of DMD patients, with approximately 60% carrying deletions and 5-10% carrying duplications. Most of the remaining 30-35% of patients are expected to have small nucleotide substitutions, insertions, or deletions. To detect these subtle changes within the coding and splice site determining sequences of the dystrophin gene, we established a semiautomated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) mutation scanning system. The DGGE scan covers the dystrophin gene with 95 amplicons, PCRed either individually or in a multiplex setup. PCR and pooling were performed semiautomatically, using a pipetting robot and 384-well plates, enabling concurrent amplification of DNA of four patients in one run. Amplification of individual fragments was performed using one PCR program. The products were pooled just before gel loading; DGGE requires only a single gel condition. Validation was performed using DNA samples harboring 39 known DMD variants, all of which could be readily detected. DGGE mutation scanning was applied to analyze 135 DMD/BMD patients and potential DMD carriers without large deletions or duplications. In DNA from 25 out of 44 DMD patients (57%) and from 5 out of 39 BMD patients (13%), we identified clear pathogenic changes. All mutations were different, with the exception of one DMD mutation, which occurred twice. In DNA from 10 out of 44 potential DMD carriers, including four obligate carriers, we detected causative changes, including one pathogenic change in every obligate carrier. In addition to these pathogenic changes, we detected 15 unique unclassified variants, i.e., changes for which a pathogenic nature is uncertain.</text></passage></document><document><id>726</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>HPRT-APRT-deficient mice are not a model for lesch-nyhan syndrome. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset><text>Complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HPRT ) deficiency in humans results in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome which is characterized , among other features , by compulsive self-injurious behavior .

Our data show age-specific characteristics of PWS patients with fatal or life-threatening illnesses. Under the age of 2 years, childhood illnesses in general were associated with high fever and rapid demise or near-demise. Hypothalamic dysfunction likely plays a role in exaggerated fever response, but also perhaps in central regulation of adrenal function. Below average sized adrenal glands were found in three children, which raises the possibility of unrecognized adrenal insufficiency in a subset of individuals with PWS and emphasizes the vital role of autopsy. The tub drowning death of an adult patient could be related to central hypersomnia, which has been reported in PWS. We suggest that increased risk for critical illness be considered in the discussion of anticipatory guidance for the care of infants with PWS. Since a number of children died while hospitalized, particularly close observation of PWS children who are ill enough to warrant hospital admission is recommended.</text></passage></document><document><id>728</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>FOXC1 gene deletion is associated with eye anomalies in ring chromosome 6.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>We report a case of ring chromosome 6 presenting with growth and mental retardation, cerebral dysgenesis, eye malformations, mixed hearing loss, and abnormal physical features.

We present clinical and cytogenetic summaries on 23 reported cases of ring 6 and categorize them into mild, moderate, and severely affected groups. Further phenotype comparisons between cases with ring 6 and cases with only 6p or 6q terminal deletions suggest that genes important for hearing, vision, and central nervous system development remain to be identified in chromosome 6 terminal regions. Molecular definition of the fusion points and tissue mosaicism studies are necessary to better understand the genotype-phenotype correlation of ring 6.

We have studied eight Scandinavian families with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis and identified three point mutations, two codon deletions, two splice site mutations, and a complex deletion/insertion. Two of the point mutations were in the KRT1 gene (F191C and K177N) and the other was in KRT10 (L453P). All three patients had associated palmoplantar keratoderma. The splice site mutations in KRT1 both caused a large deletion removing 22 codons (delta176-197) from the 1A helical domain. Codon deletions were found in KRT1 (delta170-173) and in KRT10 (delta161-162) in two patients with a severe phenotype. A final patient had a more complex mutation with a large deletion (442 bp) together with a large insertion (214 bp) of unknown origin that caused deletion of exon 6 in KRT1. In conclusion, we have found eight novel keratin mutations that cause epidermolytic hyperkeratosis with differing phenotypes. Even when a large part of keratin 1 (46 amino acids) is deleted, surprisingly mild phenotypes can result, suggesting that genotype-phenotype relationships in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis are complex and do not solely depend on the type of mutation but also depend on interactions between the behavior of the mutant protein and the cellular environment.</text></passage></document><document><id>730</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Pharmacological induction of redundant genes for a therapy of X-ALD: phenylbutyrate and other compounds.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset></passage></document><document><id>731</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Multiple sclerosis in 54 twinships: concordance rate is independent of zygosity.

The final sample included 54 pairs. Twin zygosity was determined by DNA fingerprint analysis. We found 17 monozygotic pairs and 37 dizygotic pairs. One of the 17 monozygotic pairs (5.9%) and 1 of the 37 dizygotic pairs (2.7%) were concordant for MS. In 42 of the clinically unaffected twins, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, and 9 scans were classified as indicative of MS. Three of these 42 patients had abnormal visual-evoked potentials, but all 3 had normal MRI scans. The overall proportion of pairs in which the co-twin had some form of clinical, radiological, or electrophysiological abnormality was approximately 30%; this proportion was independent of zygosity.</text></passage></document><document><id>732</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical spectrum of episodic ataxia type 2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>45</offset><text>The authors searched for mutations in CACNA1A in patients with episodic ataxia and describe the clinical spectrum in genetically defined patients. Eighteen families and nine sporadic cases of episodic ataxia were evaluated for mutations in CACNA1A. The families were first genotyped to check for linkage to the chromosome 19p locus of CACNA1A. In families consistent with linkage and in the sporadic cases, the authors screened for polymorphisms in CACNA1A using single-strand conformational polymorphism and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography followed by direct sequencing to identify specific nucleotide changes. Of the 18 families, 11 were linked to 19p and mutations were found in 9. Mutations were detected in four of the nine sporadic cases. Overall, five nonsense mutations, four missense mutations, two deletions, one insertion, and one donor splice mutation were identified. All but two of the 64 genetically defined patients reported episodes of ataxia (two members of one family only had progressive ataxia). All but one had onset before age 20 and all but four had interictal nystagmus. Migraine headaches occurred in more than half, and about two thirds reported a good response to treatment with acetazolamide. Vertigo and weakness accompanied the ataxia in more than half of the genetically defined patients. One family had multiple members with epilepsy. A wide range of mutations in CACNA1A were associated with episodic ataxia. Four of 13 were missense mutations; the remainder predicted truncated proteins. The mutations were scattered throughout the gene, and only 2 of the 13 mutations identified in our laboratory have been reported by other laboratories, so it will not be possible to screen a few "hot spots" in CACNA1A. Overall, the type of mutation, missense versus nonsense, or the location of altered or truncated amino acid residues did not predict the clinical phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>733</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Redistribution of transcription start sites within the FMR1 promoter region with expansion of the downstream CGG-repeat element.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>129</offset><text>Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of mental impairment, is caused by expansion of a (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat element located in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Repeat expansion is known to influence both transcription and translation; however, the mechanisms by which the CGG element exerts its effects are not known. In the current work, we have utilized 5'-RLM-RACE to examine the influence of CGG repeat number on the utilization of transcription start sites in normal (n&lt;55) and premutation (54&lt;n&lt;200) cell lines of both non-neural (lymphoblastoid) and neural (primary astrocyte) origin. Our results demonstrate that, in both neural and non-neural cells, transcription of the FMR1 gene is initiated from several transcription start sites within a approximately 50 nt region that lies approximately 130 nt upstream of the CGG repeat element. For normal alleles, most transcripts initiate from the downstream-most start site, close to the single position identified previously. Surprisingly, as the size of the CGG repeat expands into the premutation range, initiation shifts to the upstream sites, suggesting that the CGG element may act as a downstream enhancer/modulator of transcription. The shift in start site selection for both neural and non-neural cells indicates that the effect is general. Furthermore, the correspondence between start site utilization and the degree of elevation of FMR1 mRNA suggests that a substantial fraction of the increased message in the premutation range may derive from the upstream start sites.</text></passage></document><document><id>734</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of the somatic mutational spectrum of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene in neurofibromatosis patients with benign and malignant tumors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>159</offset><text>One of the main features of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is benign neurofibromas, 10-20% of which become transformed into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). The molecular basis of NF1 tumorigenesis is, however, still unclear. Ninety-one tumors from 31 NF1 patients were screened for gross changes in the NF1 gene using microsatellite/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers; loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 17 out of 91 (19%) tumors (including two out of seven MPNSTs). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was then used to screen 43 LOH-negative and 10 LOH-positive tumors for NF1 microlesions at both RNA and DNA levels. Thirteen germline and 12 somatic mutations were identified, of which three germline (IVS7-2A>G, 3731delT, 6117delG) and eight somatic (1888delG, 4374-4375delCC, R2129S, 2088delG, 2341del18, IVS27b-5C>T, 4083insT, Q519P) were novel. A mosaic mutation (R2429X) was also identified in a neurofibroma by DHPLC analysis and cloning/sequencing. The observed somatic and germline mutational spectra were similar in terms of mutation type, relative frequency of occurrence, and putative underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis. Tumors lacking mutations were screened for NF1 gene promoter hypermethylation but none were found. Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis revealed MSI in five out of 11 MPNSTs as compared to none out of 70 neurofibromas (p=1.8 x 10(-5)). The screening of seven MPNSTs for subtle mutations in the CDKN2A and TP53 genes proved negative, although the screening of 11 MPNSTs detected LOH involving either the TP53 or the CDKN2A gene in a total of four tumors. These findings are consistent with the view that NF1 tumorigenesis is a complex multistep process involving a variety of different types of genetic defect at multiple loci.</text></passage></document><document><id>735</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Age dependence of endogenous galactose formation in Q188R homozygous galactosemic patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>The age dependence of endogenous galactose formation was investigated in Q188R homozygous galactosemic patients (n=18; 4-38 years) using the primed continuous infusion approach with D-[1-13C]galactose as a substrate. Studies were conducted under postabsorptive conditions (fasting >10h) and good metabolic control. In the patients, the release of galactose from endogenous sources into plasma (R(a)) decreased with age and ranged from 4.6 to 2.0 micromol/kg body weight per h. Galactitol and galactonate release rates paralleled the galactose R(a) but at a lower level. The mean relation of galactose, galactitol, and galactonate release was 10:5:1. Statistically, there was a highly significant (p&lt;0.0001) inverse correlation between total galactose release (i.e., sum of R(a) plus galactitol and galactonate release) and age. The data (total galactose=y, age=t) were best fitted to the simple exponential model y=y(0)+axexp(-bt) by non-linear regression analysis. The parameter estimates were y(0)=3.0+/-0.2, a=6.5+/-0.4, and b=0.11+/-0.02. The value of y(0) provides an estimate of total galactose release in adult patients (i.e., approximately 13 mg/kg body weight per day), summation operator (y(0)+a) provides an estimate for galactosemic newborns (i.e., approximately 41 mg/kg body weight per day). The data show that significant amounts of endogenous galactose are formed in galactosemic patients with release rates being several fold higher in infants than in adults. The present findings can explain the persistently elevated galactose-1-phosphate levels in erythrocytes-and its age dependence-in galactosemic patients even when under strict dietary treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>736</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Dominantly inherited progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia with hypoplastic toes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To present four related patients with progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPsRD) each with distinctive history, unique phenotype and some peculiar radiographic findings.

Peculiar radiographic findings were hypoplasia of the 3rd and 4th metatarsals, platyspondyly with rectangular shape of the lumbar spinal canal, progressive narrowing of the joint spaces and early synovial chondromatosis. Finally, the condition was inherited as a dominant trait. This constellation of abnormalities constitutes a distinct form of PPsRD.

Patients with borderline SMEI (SMEB) are a subgroup with clinical features similar to those of core SMEI but are not necessarily consistent with the accepted diagnostic criteria for core SMEI. The aim of this study was to delineate the genetic correlation between core SMEI and SMEB and to estimate the frequency of mutations in both phenotypes. METHODS: We examined 96 healthy volunteers and 58 unrelated individuals whose clinical features were consistent with either core SMEI (n = 31) or SMEB (n = 27). We screened for genetic abnormalities within exons and their flanking introns of the genes encoding major subunits of the Na+ channels (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN1B, and SCN2B) by using a direct sequencing method. RESULTS: In both core SMEI and SMEB, various mutations of SCN1A including nonsense and missense mutations were identified, whereas no mutations of SCN2A, SCN1B, and SCN2B were found within the regions examined. All mutations were heterozygous and not found in 192 control chromosomes. Mutations were identified in 26 (44.8%) of the 58 individuals and were more frequent (p &lt; 0.05) in core SMEI (19 of 31) than in SMEB (seven of 27), as assessed by the continuity-adjusted chi2 test. Mutations resulting in a molecular truncation were found only in core SMEI. Among the mutations, two missense mutations were found in both core SMEI and SMEB. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that SMEB is part of the SMEI spectrum and may expand the recognition of SMEI and suggest other responsible or modifying genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>738</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The c.419-420insA in the MTP gene is associated with abetalipoproteinemia among French-Canadians.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset><text>Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterised by the absence of apolipoprotein B (apoB) containing lipoproteins and, in consequence, very low triglyceride and cholesterol levels.

The purpose of this study was to show the molecular genetic defects and genomic imprinting basis in Chinese PWS patients and to evaluate the clinical applications of a differential diagnostic test for PWS. METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and methylation-specific PCR (MSPCR) techniques were applied for 4 clinically suspected PWS patients. Using three probes, including SNRPN probe for identification of the critical locus in PWS region, D15Z1 and PML control probes for identification of the 15p arm and 15q arm, the authors detected the deletions 15q in PWS. MSPCR was based on sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA and PCR primers specific for the maternal and paternal allele. RESULTS: When hybridized with mixed probes, it was found in 2 patients that the central specific signal was absent, but both the flanking control signals were retained, indicating SNRPN gene deletion of chromosome 15q11-13. Bisulfite-modified DNA from all PWS children amplified with methylated allele-specific primer pair showed only maternal 131bp PCR product, indicating the maternal uniparental disomy (UPD15). CONCLUSION: Genomic imprinting plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS that caused by paternal microdeletions of 15q11-q13 or maternal UPD of chromosome 15. The basic defect seemed to be an absence of function of PWS genes that are normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome 15. MSPCR is a rapid and simple PCR-based assay compared with other cyto-molecular tests and its results were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of PWS, so it seems to be a reliable diagnostic method for PWS patients who show abnormal methylation at SNRPN. The genetic differential tests for PWS are important in determining familial recurrence risk.</text></passage></document><document><id>740</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Absence of dystrophin in mice reduces NO-dependent vascular function and vascular density: total recovery after a treatment with the aminoglycoside gentamicin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>160</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the dystrophin gene causing Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) lead to premature stop codons. In mice lacking dystrophin (mdx mice), a model for DMD, these mutations can be suppressed by aminoglycosides such as gentamicin. Dystrophin plays a role in flow (shear stress)-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation (FMD) in arteries. We investigated the effect of gentamicin on vascular contractile and dilatory functions, vascular structure, and density in mdx mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated mice carotid and mesenteric resistance arteries were mounted in arteriographs allowing continuous diameter measurements. Mdx mice showed lower nitric oxide (NO)-dependent FMD and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression as well as decreased vascular density in gracilis and cardiac muscles compared with control mice. Treatment with gentamycin restored these parameters. In contrast, smooth muscle-dependent contractions as well as endothelium-dependent or -independent dilation were not affected by dystrophin deficiency or by gentamicin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Dystrophin deficiency induces a selective defect in flow-dependent mechanotransduction, thus attenuating FMD and eNOS expression, and may contribute to low arteriolar density. These findings open important perspectives regarding the mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of genetic diseases related to premature stop codons such as DMD.</text></passage></document><document><id>741</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda: a novel SEDL mutation in a Jewish Ashkenazi family and clinical intervention considerations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>138</offset><text>X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT; MIM 313400) is a late onset progressive skeletal disorder, which manifests in childhood and is characterized by disproportionate short stature with a short trunk, barrel chest and absence of systemic complications.

Probably, this DNA domain originates from the gene family of the serine proteases after having lost the informations for the proteolytic functions. Instead of this, the haptoglobins have acquired other qualities, among them the hemoglobin binding capacity, inserted into the Hp beta chain. The Hp polymorphism is constituted by the evolutionary progressive DNA sequences for the Hp alpha chains, which probably have activation functions. The haptoglobins display immunoregulative abilities, which can be immunosuppressive by inhibition of the lymphocyte reactivity or immunoinductive by influencing the IgM biosynthesis, adapted to the functional requirements. In this field, Hp 2-2 has a stronger effect than the two other Hp types. Moreover, the haptoglobins inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis and protect against harmful oxidation processes. These qualities are based on the hemoglobin binding ability and can be realized by Hp 1-1 with the comparatively highest efficacy. Further on, the haptoglobins are protease inhibitors. Finally, Hp 2-2 is associated with higher albumin and ceruloplasmin serum levels than Hp 2-1 and Hp 1-1. Evidently, the haptoglobins are inserted into a widely ramified network of biological functions. The selective advantages and disadvantages of the Hp polymorphism are noticeable under pathological conditions in case of malignant tumors, inflammations, autoimmune diseases, allergic illness, affective psychoses and affective lability favouring addiction.</text></passage></document><document><id>743</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PPP2R1B gene alterations inhibit interaction of PP2A-Abeta and PP2A-C proteins in colorectal cancers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>102</offset><text>The chromosome region 11q is frequently deleted in colorectal cancers.

The present study investigated whether or not PP2A-Abeta is altered in colorectal cancers. We searched for alterations of the PPP2R1B gene and interactions between PP2A-Abeta and PP2A-C proteins in 50 surgically resected colorectal cancer tissues. Missense mutations and homozygous deletions of the PPP2R1B gene were found in 4 of 50 patients (8%) and in 1 of 50 patients, respectively, with colorectal cancers. Deletions and/or point mutations within 412-601 amino acid sequences (binding regions of PP2A-C protein) of the PPP2R1B gene derived from colorectal cancer tissues inhibited co-immunoprecipitation of PP2A-Abeta and PP2A-C proteins. These finding suggested that the PPP2R1B gene functions as a tumor suppressor gene and acts as a molecular switch that becomes active in response to specific up-stream signals. Upon activation, the gene alters the activities of specific downstream target proteins for the cell cycle regulations and/or metabolism in some colorectal cancers.</text></passage></document><document><id>744</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Ashkenazi Jewish population frequencies for common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major identified causes of inherited breast cancer , with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90 % lifetime risk of breast cancer in carrier females .

Prostate cancer cells that survive androgen ablation therapy express pro-survival genes (i.e. bcl-2) permitting these androgen independent (AI) cells to overcome apoptotic signals and proliferate in the absence of normal growth signals. To disrupt tumor growth and progression to AI, we expressed the tumor suppressor gene, WT1 in LNCaP prostate tumor cells. The WT1 transcription factor modulates expression and activity of several prostate growth control genes (i.e. par-4, bcl-2 and AR) in vitro. To provide insight into potential mechanisms of prostate cancer growth suppression both the transcriptionally active form of wild-type WT1 (D) and an inactive WT1 (D) R394W mutant form were stably transfected in LNCaP cells. Surprisingly both transfected lines underwent apoptosis and were growth suppressed in nude mice. A 3-fold reduction in overall tumor incidence and volume was associated with increased apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and par-4 expression, and was reduced or absent in early forming LNCaP tumors. After several months the indolent WT1-LNCaP cells became proliferative forming small tumors lacking par-4 protein. Although bcl-2 protein was present in all LNCaP tumors at this late-stage, it was detected in only a minority of WT1-LNCaP tumors, suggesting that pro-survival signals continued to be reduced in WT1-suppressed tumor cells. While the mechanisms of WT1-mediated growth suppression and apoptosis in LNCaP tumor cells are unknown, our results argue against simple transcriptional regulation since the mutant WT1 (D) R394W suppressed tumor formation similarly to wild-type WT1. This suggests that the mechanism of WT1-mediated growth suppression does not rely upon DNA binding at known WT1 recognition sites.</text></passage></document><document><id>746</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>C5 deficiency in A/J mice is not associated with resistance to the development of secondary amyloidosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>The aim of the study was to determine whether C5 deficiency in the mouse is associated with resistance to the development of secondary amyloidosis.

Using a restriction fragment length polymorphism generated by digestion of genomic DNA with the restriction enzyme HindIII, C5 sufficient and deficient DNA can be clearly differentiated. Eight mice were found to be C5 sufficient, 32 were heterozygotes and 14 were found to be C5 deficient. Grading of the splenic amyloid load from negative to 4+ was performed after staining tissue squashes with Congo red and viewing them under a polarizing microscope. Seventeen mice were noted to have negative to trace, 18 had moderate (1+ - 2+) and 19 had heavy (3+ - 4+) amyloid deposition. There was no correlation between splenic amyloid load and C5 deficiency.

The vast majority of FRDA mutations involve expansion of a GAA*TTC-repeat tract in intron 1, which leads to an FXN mRNA deficit. Bisulfite mapping demonstrates that the region adjacent to the repeat was methylated in both unaffected and affected individuals. However, methylation was more extensive in patients. Additionally, three residues were almost completely methylation-free in unaffected individuals but almost always methylated in those with FRDA. One of these residues is located within an E-box whose deletion caused a significant drop in promoter activity in reporter assays. Elevated levels of histone H3 dimethylated on lysine 9 were seen in FRDA cells consistent with a more repressive chromatin organization. Such chromatin is known to reduce transcription elongation. This may be one way in which the expanded repeats contribute to the frataxin deficit in FRDA. Our data also suggest that repeat-mediated chromatin changes may also affect transcription initiation by blocking binding of factors that increase frataxin promoter activity. Our results also raise the possibility that the repeat-mediated increases in DNA methylation in the FXN gene in FRDA patients are secondary to the chromatin changes.</text></passage></document><document><id>750</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hemipelvectomy, report of a case.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>34</offset></passage></document><document><id>751</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Posterior scalp defects in Opitz syndrome.

The three closely related genes belong to a gene family with at least eight members in mammals and are candidate genes for quantitative traits related to dietary fat uptake, lipid synthesis and storage. MOGAT2 and DGAT2 form a tandem and were mapped to bovine chromosome (BTA) 15q25-->q26 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. MOGAT1 was localized to BTA 2q43-->q44. The three genes were investigated for polymorphisms that might be associated with breeding values for milk fat percentage in the dairy breeds German Holstein, German Simmental and German Brown. All the detected polymorphisms were located outside exons or, with one exception, were silent. In MOGAT1, a missense mutation in exon 4 was found that causes a non-conservative substitution of cysteine170 (uncharged, hydrophobic) by lysine (positively charged, hydrophilic). However, allele frequency estimates from pooled DNA samples revealed no significant association of the observed polymorphisms with breeding values for milk fat percentage. A comparative analysis of chromosomal locations and exon-intron structure of the known members of the DGAT2/MOGAT gene family in humans, rodents and cattle indicates an ancient tandem duplication of the ancestor gene combined with an intron gain (or loss) in one copy. Further members of the family may have arisen by duplications of this gene tandem via two rounds of interchromosomal or genome duplications as well as further local (single) gene duplication and loss events.</text></passage></document><document><id>754</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Another aspect of the galactosemia enigma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>43</offset></passage></document><document><id>755</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The role of cathepsin C in Papillon-Lef  vre syndrome, prepubertal periodontitis, and aggressive periodontitis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>We have previously reported that loss-of-function mutations in the cathepsin C gene (CTSC) result in Papillon-Lef  vre syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by palmoplantar keratosis and early-onset, severe periodontitis. Others have also reported CTSC mutations in patients with severe prepubertal periodontitis, but without any skin manifestations. The possible role of CTSC variants in more common types of non-mendelian, early-onset, severe periodontitis ("aggressive periodontitis") has not been investigated. In this study, we have investigated the role of CTSC in all three conditions. We demonstrate that PLS is genetically homogeneous and the mutation spectrum that includes three novel mutations (c.386T>A/p.V129E, c.935A>G/p.Q312R, and c.1235A>G/p.Y412C) in 21 PLS families (including eight from our previous study) provides an insight into structure-function relationships of CTSC. Our data also suggest that a complete loss-of-function appears to be necessary for the manifestation of the phenotype, making it unlikely that weak CTSC mutations are a cause of aggressive periodontitis. This was confirmed by analyses of the CTSC activity in 30 subjects with aggressive periodontitis and age-sex matched controls, which demonstrated that there was no significant difference between these two groups (1,728.7 +/- SD 576.8 micro moles/mg/min vs. 1,678.7 +/- SD 527.2 micro moles/mg/min, respectively, p = 0.73). CTSC mutations were detected in only one of two families with prepubertal periodontitis; these did not form a separate functional class with respect to those observed in classical PLS. The affected individuals in the other prepubertal periodontitis family not only lacked CTSC mutations, but in addition did not share the haplotypes at the CTSC locus. These data suggest that prepubertal periodontitis is a genetically heterogeneous disease that, in some families, just represents a partially penetrant PLS.</text></passage></document><document><id>756</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Promoter polymorphism of SLC11A1 (formerly NRAMP1) confers susceptibility to autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus in Japanese.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>Defective function of antigen-presenting cells has been postulated to be one of the non-HLA-linked susceptibility factors for type 1 diabetes mellitus, though the underlying genetic factors remain unclear. SLC11A1 (formerly NRAMP1), a divalent cation transporter, plays a crucial role in macrophage activation. We performed a case-control study in 224 healthy and 95 type 1 diabetic Japanese subjects, examining the length polymorphisms in the promoter region (-377 to -222) of SLC11A1, which may influence transcriptional activity. Alleles designated 2, 3, and 7 have been identified in Japanese subjects. The frequency of allele 7 was significantly higher in subjects with type 1 diabetes (9.47%) than in the healthy controls (4.46%). The difference is more marked in the subpopulation of Japanese subjects with type 1 diabetes; diabetic subjects with at least one protective HLA class II allele and those without any susceptibility HLA class II haplotypes, DR4-DQ4 or DR9-DQ9, had a much higher allele 7 frequency than controls. These findings suggest that the novel promoter polymorphism of SLC11A1 influences the susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in Japanese subjects.</text></passage></document><document><id>757</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Heterodimer formation and activity in the human enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset><text>One of the fundamental questions concerning expression and function of dimeric enzymes involves the impact of naturally occurring mutations on subunit assembly and heterodimer activity . This question is of particular interest for the human enzyme galactose-l-phosphate uridylyl-transferase ( GALT ) , impairment of which results in the inherited metabolic disorder galactosemia , because many if not most patients studied to date are compound heterozygotes rather than true molecular homozygotes . Furthermore , the broad range of phenotypic severity observed in these patients raises the possibility that allelic combination , not just allelic constitution , may play some role in determining outcome . In the work described herein , we have selected two distinct naturally occurring null mutations of GALT , Q188R and R333W , and asked the questions ( i ) what are the impacts of these mutations on subunit assembly , and ( ii ) if heterodimers do form , are they active ? To answer these questions , we have established a yeast system for the coexpression of epitope-tagged alleles of human GALT and investigated both the extent of specific GALT subunit interactions and the activity of defined heterodimer pools . We have found that both homodimers and heterodimers do form involving each of the mutant subunits tested and that both heterodimer pools retain substantial enzymatic activity . These results are significant not only in terms of their implications for furthering our understanding of galactosemia and GALT holoenzyme structure-function relationships but also because the system described may serve as a model for similar studies of other complexes composed of multiple subunits . . </text></passage></document><document><id>758</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 phosphorylation by Aurora-A in the regulation of G2 to M transition.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>Aurora-A/BTAK/STK15 localizes to the centrosome in the G(2)-M phase, and its kinase activity regulates the G(2) to M transition of the cell cycle. Previous studies have shown that the BRCA1 breast cancer tumor suppressor also localizes to the centrosome and that BRCA1 inactivation results in loss of the G(2)-M checkpoint. We demonstrate here that Aurora-A physically binds to and phosphorylates BRCA1. Biochemical analysis showed that BRCA1 amino acids 1314-1863 binds to Aurora-A. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Ser(308) of BRCA1 is phosphorylated by Aurora-A in vitro. Anti-phospho-specific antibodies against Ser(308) of BRCA1 demonstrated that Ser(308) is phosphorylated in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser(308) increased in the early M phase when Aurora-A activity also increases; these effects could be abolished by ionizing radiation. Consistent with these observations, acute loss of Aurora-A by small interfering RNA resulted in reduced phosphorylation of BRCA1 Ser(308), and transient infection of adenovirus Aurora-A increased Ser(308) phosphorylation. Mutation of a single phosphorylation site of BRCA1 (S308N), when expressed in BRCA1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, decreased the number of cells in the M phase to a degree similar to that with wild type BRCA1-mediated G(2) arrest induced by DNA damage. We propose that BRCA1 phosphorylation by Aurora-A plays a role in G(2) to M transition of cell cycle.</text></passage></document><document><id>759</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The fragile X syndrome: from molecular genetics to neurobiology.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Since the identification of the FMR1 gene basic research has been focused on the molecular characterization of the FMR1 gene product, the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).

Currently, compelling evidence suggests a role for FMRP in the transport/translation of dendritically localized mRNAs.

DNA was amplified for all coding exons of the RDH5 gene with established primer pairs, and sequenced directly. Each family had a different mutation in the RDH5 gene. Family A had a homozygous mutation (Gly107Arg) while family B had a compound heterozygous mutation (Arg280His and Leu310GluVal). The obligate carriers were heterozygous with the wild-type and mutant-type alleles.

The most severe complication is the development of renal amyloidosis. Over 35 mutations have been discovered so far in the gene responsible for the disease, MEFV. This article aims at determining a correlation between the MEFV genotype and the occurrence of amyloidosis in FMF patients, in addition to the study of the modifying effects of the SAA1 (type 1 serum amyloid A protein) and MICA (Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class-I-chain-related gene A) genes on this severe complication. METHODS: Fourteen MEFV mutations were screened and the SAA1 and MICA polymorphisms tested in 30 FMF patients with amyloidosis and 40 FMF patients without amyloidosis. RESULTS: The M694V and V726A allelic frequencies were, respectively, significantly higher and lower in the group with amyloidosis, compared to the control FMF group. The beta and gamma SAA1 alleles were more frequently encountered in the group without amyloidosis, whereas the alpha allele was significantly more observed in FMF patients with amyloidosis (p &lt; 0.025). All the MICA alleles were encountered in both patients' groups, but none of them was significantly associated with amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a protective effect of the SAA1 beta and gamma alleles on the development of amyloidosis and show the absence of a MICA modifying effect on amyloidosis development. Testing these polymorphisms on a larger sample will lead to more definite conclusions.</text></passage></document><document><id>763</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Abnormal brain structure in adults with Van der Woude syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>64</offset><text>Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant disorder manifested in cleft lip and/or palate and lip pits. Isolated clefts of the lip and/or palate (ICLP) have both genotype and phenotype overlap with VWS. Subjects with ICLP have abnormalities in brain structure and function. Given the similarities between VWS and ICLP, the current study was designed to evaluate the pattern of brain structure of adults with VWS. Fourteen adults with VWS were compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Brain structure was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. All subjects with VWS had enlarged volumes of the anterior regions of the cerebrum. Men with VWS had reduced volumes of the posterior cerebrum. Anterior cerebrum volume was negatively correlated with intelligent quotient in the subjects with VWS indicating that the enlargement of this brain region was 'pathologic.' The pattern of brain structure in VWS is nearly identical to those seen in ICLP. In addition, men are affected more severely. Pathologic enlargement of the tissue and a gender effect with men affected more severely are common features of neurodevelopmental disorders supporting the notion that the brain structure of VWS and ICLP may be because of abnormal brain development.</text></passage></document><document><id>764</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular screening of ALK1/ACVRL1 and ENG genes in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in France.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>Hereditary hemmorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, or Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations, affecting 1 out of 10,000 individuals in France. The disease is caused by mutations of two genes: ENG and ALK1 (ACVRL1). We screened the coding sequence of ENG and ALK1 in 160 unrelated French index cases. A germline mutation was identified in 100 individuals (62.5%). A total of 36 mutations were found in ENG, including three nonsense mutations, 19 small insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift, two inframe deletions, seven missense mutations, and five intronic or splice-site mutations. Of the 36 mutations, 33 were novel mutations. A total of 64 mutations were found in ALK1, including six nonsense mutations, 28 small insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift, one inframe deletion, 27 missense mutations, and two intronic or splice-site mutations. Of the 64 mutations, 27 were novel mutations. Mutations were found in most parts of the coding sequence for both genes, except ALK1 exon 5 and ENG exons 12 to 14. Missense mutations in ALK1 were more frequent in exons 7, 8, and 10. ENG cDNA was sequenced for three intronic mutations: c.689+2T>C produced an abnormal transcript excluding exon 5, c.1103+3_1103+8del activated a cryptic splice site 22 bp upstream, and c.1428G>A produced two abnormal transcripts, one including intron 11 and the other excluding exon 10. Although most of the mutations were private, some recurrent mutations in ALK1 were of particular interest. Mutation c.1112_1113dupG (p.Gly371fsX391) was found in 17 unrelated individuals sharing a common haplotype, strongly suggesting a founder effect related to the concentration of patients previously reported in a specific French region (Rh  ne-Alpes). Three missense mutations involved the same codon: c.1231C>T (p.Arg411Trp), c.1232G>C (p.Arg411Pro), and c.1232G>A (p.Arg411Gln) were found in seven, two, and one patients, respectively.

Exon amplification and RT-PCR were used to identify mutations. In patient 1, with low activity in all three assays, we identified a c.1194A>C (E398D) missense mutation. In patient 2 with a considerable activity of the GK enzyme (22% of reference), oxidation to [(14)C]CO(2) (37%) and a high incorporation of [(14)C] into macromolecules (92%), we identified a c.182T>C (L61P) mutation that causes the enzyme to have a higher K(m) for glycerol ( approximately 300 microM) than normals (2-8 microM). In patient 3, the GK activity estimated by the three different methods ranged from 16 to 22% of reference. Analysis of mRNA from the GK gene revealed three alternatively spliced transcripts. A mutation in intron 3 (g.16835G>A) resulted in an insertion of a cryptic exon between exon 2 or 3 and exon 4. Patient 4 with minor glyceroluria (7 mmol/l) and normal plasma glycerol concentration had normal activity with all three assay methods, thus excluding GK deficiency (GKD) as a cause of slight glyceroluria. To evaluate fully patients with glyceroluria, one needs to measure the GK activity and relate this and the clinical data to genetic findings. Residual enzyme activities in cultured fibroblasts can be found in GKD patients with severe clinical symptoms.</text></passage></document><document><id>766</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Endolymphatic sac tumors in von Hippel-Lindau disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>55</offset><text>OBJECT: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary multiple-neoplasia syndrome mapping to chromosome 3p25-26. Endolymphatic sac (ELS) tumors have been identified as a neoplastic manifestation of VHL disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate comprehensively the natural history of inner ear disease in a large population of patients with confirmed or suspected VHL disease and to correlate the clinical features with the VHL genotype. METHODS: The authors collated and analyzed clinical and genotypic data obtained in patients enrolled in an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol in which families and individuals affected by VHL disease were studied. These data included results from multidisciplinary history workups and physical examinations, imaging studies, and a battery of audiological tests. One hundred seventy-five patients were enrolled in the study, 129 with confirmed VHL disease and 46 of their family members in whom test results for VHL disease were negative and who served as controls. Twenty-one patients had ELS tumors that were evident on magnetic resonance images; three of them had bilateral ELS lesions. Hearing loss, often sudden in onset and severe to profound in nature, vestibulopathy, aural fullness, and tinnitus represented the primary symptoms of ELS tumor. Distinct patterns of auditory and vestibular dysfunction occurred at different stages of the disease. Phenotypic data showed that 17 of 21 patients with ELS tumors did not have pheochromocytomas, whereas all had VHL disease affecting the kidney, all but two had VHL disease affecting the central nervous system, and all but one had disease affecting the pancreas. Genotyping revealed 10 rearrangements (partial deletions), eight single bp substitutions, and one 3-bp insertion. Although there was no difference in the incidence of hearing loss between populations, symptoms of imbalance and aural fullness were more common in patients with VHL disease but without imaging evidence of ELS tumor than they were in family members who did not have VHL disease (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Endolymphatic sac tumors are frequently associated with VHL disease. Symptoms of disequilibrium or aural fullness in patients with VHL disease may be an early indication of endolymphatic dysfunction. Patients with VHL disease provide a unique opportunity to examine the effects of specific gene mutations and a discrete neoplastic process on the human inner ear. The study of ELS tumors in this group also provides a pathological model of ELS function and supplies evidence for a role of the ELS in clinical M  ni  re-like disease(s).</text></passage></document><document><id>767</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Investigation of the complement system in clinical practice].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset><text>The complement system plays an important role in defence of the host against infection and in the clearance of immune complexes.

Emphasis has been placed on practical applications and understanding basic mechanisms of disease. The best screen for complement deficiencies or significant activation is the CH50, which measures total classical pathway activity and the measurement of C3 and C4. The absence or decrease of multiple components is usually due to consumption of complement. Complete lack of CH50 associated with normal C3 antigen is a strong indication for complement deficiency and should be followed up with further tests to determine which component is missing.</text></passage></document><document><id>768</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>cDNA cloning and expression analysis of a novel human F-box domain containing gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>F-box proteins are a large family of eukaryotic proteins that are characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif.

However the characteristic layered cellular anatomy of the retina makes it amenable to planar sectioning, enabling the generation of enriched retinal cell populations. The aim of this study was to validate a reproducible method for preparing enriched retinal layers from porcine retina. METHODS: The thicknesses of the retinal photoreceptor, inner nuclear and ganglion cell, and fiber layers were determined by routine histology of cross sections of fresh whole retina mounted on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Dissected retina (5 mm2) was placed on PVDF membrane and a series of planar cryosections corresponding to the photoreceptor and inner nuclear layer were removed leaving the ganglion cell and fiber layer which was subsequently detached from the membrane. The retinal specimens were stored at -80 degrees C. Representative planar tissue sections were sonicated in ice-chilled 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 7.9 and aliquots removed for RNA extraction. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze the mRNA expression of genes indicative of specific retinal layers. Ammonium bicarbonate protein extracts were centrifuged, lyophilized and prepared for direct liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using a Waters Q-Tof Ultima. RESULTS: Histological analysis established the parameters for planar cryosectioning: photoreceptor layer (69+/-1.8 microm), outer plexiform (11+/-0.6 microm), inner nuclear layer (28+/-0.5 microm), inner plexiform, ganglion cell and fiber layer (100+/-5.3 microm). Gene expression profiling provided an independent method for validating the respective retinal preparations. For example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was expressed up to 21 fold higher in the inner retinal "ganglion cell enriched" fraction than in the outer retinal "photoreceptor enriched" fraction. The pattern was reversed for blue cone opsin, which was expressed up to 24 fold higher in the "photoreceptor enriched" fraction. Endogenous protein fragments indicative of each layer were identified by mass spectrometry and de novo sequence data obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Combined histological and mRNA expression profiling has confirmed the development of a reproducible method for generating validated porcine retinal layers enriched for specific cell types. Direct proteome analysis detected endogenous peptide fragments of characteristic retinal proteins. Further analysis of these enriched retinal cell preparations will facilitate a more selective investigation of the retinal transcriptome and proteome than studies of the intact retina.</text></passage></document><document><id>770</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Case report of a patient with ochronosis and arthroplasty of the hip and both knees].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>Alkaptonuria is a rare hereditary metabolic disorder characterised by absence of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase.

The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is the first step in thyroid hormone synthesis and mediates the active iodide transport in the thyroid cells suggesting that decreased iodide uptake could be a result of changes in NIS expression or molecular defects in the NIS gene. In contrast to previous studies, an intraindividual comparison of NIS mRNA expression in CTNs and their corresponding surrounding tissue was performed using direct detection of NIS mRNA. A significant reduction in NIS mRNA expression was detected in 86% of the 14 investigated CTNs. We hypothesized that human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) transcriptional failure could be caused by primary molecular NIS gene defects and/or methylation of DNA in the NIS promoter. However, no mutation in the NIS cDNA nor in the NIS promoter region upstream up to-443 bp from the ATG start codon was detected. Therefore, primary molecular NIS gene defects were excluded. However, in 50% of CTNs with reduced NIS mRNA expression, the promoter region was hypermethylated. NIS mRNA expression in these hypermethylated CTNs only reached a maximum of 30% of the corresponding surrounding tissue. Hence, methylation of CpG islands in the NIS promotor could be a regulatory mechanism of NIS transcription in CTNs. Immunoblot revealed absent hNIS protein expression in the total cell membrane fraction in 45% of investigated nodules. In the majority of the remaining CTNs NIS protein expression was decreased in the nodule tissue compared to the corresponding surrounding tissue. For investigating protein expression immunhistochemistry has two advantages. First, the whole nodule area can be investigated, and second, NIS expression can be detected in areas where an immunoblot of a cell membrane fraction is negative. Interestingly, immunhistochemistry revealed higher NIS expression in 50% of CTNs compared to their corresponding surrounding tissues and NIS staining was predominantly intracellular. These data demonstrate that NIS protein expression does not reflect NIS mRNA expression. Therefore, factors that affect targeting of NIS to the plasma membrane are likely to be affected.</text></passage></document><document><id>772</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Missense or splicing mutation? The case of a fibrinogen Bbeta-chain mutation causing severe hypofibrinogenemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>The genetic basis of severe hypofibrinogenemia was analyzed in a 57-year-old Italian woman. She turned out to be a compound heterozygote for a novel putative missense mutation (Leu172Gln) and a previously described nonsense mutation (Arg17Stop) in the fibrinogen Bbeta-chain gene. The pathogenetic role of Leu172Gln was analyzed by in vitro expression of the mutant recombinant protein in COS-1 cells. These experiments demonstrated that mutant Bbeta-Leu172Gln fibrinogen was normally assembled and secreted. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence surrounding the mutation suggested a possible role on pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. Production of the mutant transcript in HeLa cells confirmed that the mutation activates a cryptic acceptor splice site in exon 4, resulting in a truncated Bbeta chain, lacking approximately 70% of the C-terminal region. This represents the first exonic splicing mutation identified in the fibrinogen genes. These findings strengthen the importance to analyze potentially pathogenetic nucleotide variations at both the protein and the mRNA level.</text></passage></document><document><id>773</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Imatinib mesylate inhibits platelet-derived growth factor activity and increases chemosensitivity in feline vaccine-associated sarcoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>Feline vaccine-associated sarcoma (VAS) is a biologically aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma that can develop at sites where inactivated feline vaccines have been administered. We showed that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptor (PDGFR) play a role in the growth of VAS cells. The presence of PDGFR-beta was confirmed in each of five VAS cell lines evaluated, one non-vaccine-associated feline fibrosarcoma (FSA) cell line and a feline fibroblast-derived cell line. The PDGF/PDGFR signaling pathway was inhibited in the VAS cell lines and the FSA cell line using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (formerly called STI-571). Imatinib inhibited PDGF-BB-induced autophosphorylation of PDGFR in VAS cells and feline FSA cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Imatinib also significantly inhibited growth of feline VAS tumors in a murine xenograft model. Imatinib reversed the protective effect of PDGF-BB on growth inhibition by doxorubicin and carboplatin. PDGF-BB protected VAS cells from serum starvation and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis but not carboplatin-induced apoptosis, and imatinib eliminated this protection. These observations suggest that imatinib inhibits PDGFR tyrosine kinase activity in feline soft tissue sarcomas in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model.</text></passage></document><document><id>774</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>OCRL mutation analysis in Italian patients with Lowe syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset><text>The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL, also called OCRL1) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by major abnormalities of eyes, nervous system, and kidneys.

This jump is probably attributable to heightened awareness and changing diagnostic criteria rather than to new environmental influences. Autism is not a disease but a syndrome with multiple nongenetic and genetic causes. By autism (the autistic spectrum disorders [ASDs]), we mean the wide spectrum of developmental disorders characterized by impairments in 3 behavioral domains: 1) social interaction; 2) language, communication, and imaginative play; and 3) range of interests and activities. Autism corresponds in this article to pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Except for Rett syndrome--attributable in most affected individuals to mutations of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene--the other PDD subtypes (autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, disintegrative disorder, and PDD Not Otherwise Specified [PDD-NOS]) are not linked to any particular genetic or nongenetic cause. Review of 2 major textbooks on autism and of papers published between 1961 and 2003 yields convincing evidence for multiple interacting genetic factors as the main causative determinants of autism. Epidemiologic studies indicate that environmental factors such as toxic exposures, teratogens, perinatal insults, and prenatal infections such as rubella and cytomegalovirus account for few cases. These studies fail to confirm that immunizations with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine are responsible for the surge in autism. Epilepsy, the medical condition most highly associated with autism, has equally complex genetic/nongenetic (but mostly unknown) causes. Autism is frequent in tuberous sclerosis complex and fragile X syndrome, but these 2 disorders account for but a small minority of cases. Currently, diagnosable medical conditions, cytogenetic abnormalities, and single-gene defects (eg, tuberous sclerosis complex, fragile X syndrome, and other rare diseases) together account for &lt;10% of cases. There is convincing evidence that "idiopathic" autism is a heritable disorder. Epidemiologic studies report an ASD prevalence of approximately 3 to 6/1000, with a male to female ratio of 3:1. This skewed ratio remains unexplained: despite the contribution of a few well characterized X-linked disorders, male-to-male transmission in a number of families rules out X-linkage as the prevailing mode of inheritance. The recurrence rate in siblings of affected children is approximately 2% to 8%, much higher than the prevalence rate in the general population but much lower than in single-gene diseases. Twin studies reported 60% concordance for classic autism in monozygotic (MZ) twins versus 0 in dizygotic (DZ) twins, the higher MZ concordance attesting to genetic inheritance as the predominant causative agent. Reevaluation for a broader autistic phenotype that included communication and social disorders increased concordance remarkably from 60% to 92% in MZ twins and from 0% to 10% in DZ pairs. This suggests that interactions between multiple genes cause "idiopathic" autism but that epigenetic factors and exposure to environmental modifiers may contribute to variable expression of autism-related traits. The identity and number of genes involved remain unknown. The wide phenotypic variability of the ASDs likely reflects the interaction of multiple genes within an individual's genome and the existence of distinct genes and gene combinations among those affected. There are 3 main approaches to identifying genetic loci, chromosomal regions likely to contain relevant genes: 1) whole genome screens, searching for linkage of autism to shared genetic markers in populations of multiplex families (families with >1 affected family member; 2) cytogenetic studies that may guide molecular studies by pointing to relevant inherited or de novo chromosomal abnormalities in affected individuals and their families; and 3) evaluation of candidate genes known to affect brain development in these significantly linked regions or, alternatively, linkage of candidate genes selected a priori because of their presumptive contribution to the pathogenesis of autism. Data from whole-genome screens in multiplex families suggest interactions of at least 10 genes in the causation of autism. Thus far, a putative speech and language region at 7q31-q33 seems most strongly linked to autism, with linkages to multiple other loci under investigation. Cytogenetic abnormalities at the 15q11-q13 locus are fairly frequent in people with autism, and a "chromosome 15 phenotype" was described in individuals with chromosome 15 duplications. Among other candidate genes are the FOXP2, RAY1/ST7, IMMP2L, and RELN genes at 7q22-q33 and the GABA(A) receptor subunit and UBE3A genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. Variant alleles of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) on 17q11-q12 are more frequent in individuals with autism than in nonautistic populations. In addition, animal models and linkage data from genome screens implicate the oxytocin receptor at 3p25-p26. Most pediatricians will have 1 or more children with this disorder in their practices. They must diagnose ASD expeditiously because early intervention increases its effectiveness. Children with dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies, mental retardation, or family members with developmental disorders are those most likely to benefit from extensive medical testing and genetic consultation. The yield of testing is much less in high-functioning children with a normal appearance and IQ and moderate social and language impairments. Genetic counseling justifies testing, but until autism genes are identified and their functions are understood, prenatal diagnosis will exist only for the rare cases ascribable to single-gene defects or overt chromosomal abnormalities. Parents who wish to have more children must be told of their increased statistical risk. It is crucial for pediatricians to try to involve families with multiple affected members in formal research projects, as family studies are key to unraveling the causes and pathogenesis of autism. Parents need to understand that they and their affected children are the only available sources for identifying and studying the elusive genes responsible for autism. Future clinically useful insights and potential medications depend on identifying these genes and elucidating the influences of their products on brain development and physiology.</text></passage></document><document><id>776</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Definition of candidate low risk APC alleles in a Swedish population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>Many families experience an apparently inherited increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) similar to the known syndromes familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Besides these high-risk syndromes, approximately 10% of all CRC cases come from families with 2 affected 1st-degree relatives, and even 1st-degree relatives to a single case of CRC are at increased risk. Risk subjects from these families frequently show polyps at colonoscopy, which suggests the APC gene as a good candidate susceptibility gene for these attenuated polypotic syndromes. We used the sensitive DHPLC technique to search for possible predisposing germline mutations in the entire APC gene in 91 risk subjects from these high- and low-risk syndromes with unknown predisposing genes. Most exons were also screened for mutations in 96 normal controls and 96 colorectal cancer cases. In our study we probably have identified the most common APC variants in a Swedish population. Among 30 germline variants identified, 1 clearly pathogenic nonsense mutation and 11 putative pathogenic variants (10 missense and one 3' UTR) were found in 20 index patients (22%). Twelve silent as well as 5 intronic variants were considered nonpathogenic. Two of the missense variants found here, E1317Q and D1822V, have previously been related to a difference in risk of colorectal cancer. One variant, 8636C>A, located within the 3' UTR region of the APC gene, was suggested to constitute an additional low risk allele with a similar relative risk as the Jewish I1307K mutation (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 0.96-3.40). The question of whether all the other variants confer an increased colorectal cancer risk warrants future large association studies.</text></passage></document><document><id>777</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Dysmorphic facial features in aspartylglucosaminuria patients and carriers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>The facial photos of 76 aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) patients, 29 obligate carriers and 78 unrelated controls were evaluated for dysmorphic features to see whether this autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease includes a dysmorphic facial gestalt in addition to the well-known age-related coarsening of the facies and whether the carrier status of AGU might have an effect on the facial features. A consistent dysmorphic gestalt with hypertelorism, a short and broad nose with round nares, simple often small ears with small or missing lobule and modest folding of helices, thick lips and a square shape of face, was found to be present long before the coarsening begins. Recognition of this pattern of facial features might help in the early diagnosis of AGU. Statistically, puffy eyelids were found to be significantly more frequent in AGU carriers than in controls.

In an attempt to explain this phenomenon, we postulated that (i) in addition to genetic deletion, abnormal expression of DSB checkpoint/repair proteins might abolish the function of these genes and (ii) there might be a combined effect of individual defective genes during breast cancer pathogenesis. Using a largely homogenous group of 74 specimens of early-onset (&lt; or =35 years of age) infiltrating ductal carcinomas, we examined associations between pathological grade and genetic deletion and/or abnormal protein expression of ATM, BRCA1 and TP53. The results showed that high-grade tumours displayed a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at, and/or abnormal expression of, ATM, BRCA1 and TP53. Multigenetic analysis showed abnormalities in BRCA1 to be independently associated with high-grade tumours. ATM and TP53 appeared to play an assistant role, abnormalities in these genes significantly increasing the possibility of poor differentiation in tumours with abnormalities in BRCA1. Furthermore, a higher number of abnormalities (LOH or abnormal expression) in these three genes correlated with poor tumour differentiation. Thus, this study suggests that combined changes in several DSB checkpoint/repair genes belonging to a common functional pathway are associated with breast cancer pathogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>780</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Missense mutations in the Fas gene resulting in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome: a molecular and immunological analysis. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>129</offset><text>Programmed cell death ( or apoptosis ) is a physiological process essential to the normal development and homeostatic maintenance of the immune system .

The levels of residual acid beta-glucosidase activity of the mutant enzymes produced by the cDNAs carrying alleles c.662C>T (p.P182L), c.886C>T (p.R257X), c.1054T>C (p.Y313H), c.1289C>T (p.P391L), and c.1292A>T (p.N392I) were negligible.

A total of 482 responsive genes were identified and further clustered into 9 groups of coregulated genes. Among genes with early and strong inductions, the use of a fusion protein with the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor enabled the identification of a subset of direct targets regulated independently of de novo protein synthesis. We show that the G(1) arrest induced by hSNF5/INI1 is reversible and associated with the down-regulation of components of the DNA replication complex. We also identify an unsuspected role of hSNF5/INI1 in cytoskeleton organization. Indeed, induction of hSNF5/INI1 induces dramatic modifications of the cell shape including complete disruption of the actin stress fiber network and disappearance of focal adhesions associated with up-regulation of genes involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. We document a strong decrease of Rho activity upon hSNF5/INI1 expression, suggesting that the regulation of this activity constitutes a crucial step of the hSNF5/INI1-induced reorganization of the actin network.

A medical history revealed a normal pregnancy with no complications but a diagnosis of muscular hypotonia was made at four months of age. At 18 months a diagnosis of LNS was established through biochemical analysis and molecular examinations. The child displayed self-destructive behaviour, typical in children with LNS. Shortly thereafter the patient was supplied with arm cuffs for self-protection which were not tolerated and the self-mutilation continued. Eventually the extraction of all primary teeth was deemed necessary to prevent additional medical problems for this child.

All except 1 rat Dnmt3b pseudogene appear to be transcriptionally silent. Dnmt3a2, a transcript variant of Dnmt3a starting at an alternative promoter, had the highest number of processed pseudogenes, while none were found for the canonical Dnmt3a, suggesting the former transcript is more highly expressed in germ cells. Comparison of human, mouse, and rat Dnmt3a2 sequences also suggests that human exon 8 is a recent acquisition. Alignment of the 3'UTR of Dnmt3a2 among the functional genes and the processed pseudogenes suggested that a second polyadenylation site downstream of the RefSeq poly(A) was being used in mice, resulting in a longer 3'UTR, a finding confirmed by RT-PCR in mouse tissues. We also found conserved cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements, usually implicated in regulating translation in oocytes, in Dnmt3b and Dnmt1. Expression of DNMT3B in the mouse oocyte was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. These results clarify the structure of a number of loci in the three species examined and provide some useful insights into the structure and evolution of this gene family.</text></passage></document><document><id>788</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Expression profiling and differential screening between hepatoblastomas and the corresponding normal livers: identification of high expression of the PLK1 oncogene as a poor-prognostic indicator of hepatoblastomas.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>215</offset><text>Hepatoblastoma is one of the most common malignant liver tumors in young children.

We constructed four full-length-enriched cDNA libraries using an oligo-capping method from the primary tissues which included two hepatoblastomas with high levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a hepatoblastoma without production of AFP, and a normal liver tissue corresponded to the tumor. Among the 10,431 cDNAs randomly picked up and successfully sequenced, 847 (8.1%) were the genes with unknown function. Of interest, the expression profile among the two subsets of hepatoblastoma and a normal liver was extremely different. A semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that 86 out of 1188 genes tested were differentially expressed between hepatoblastomas and the corresponding normal livers, but that only 11 of those were expressed at high levels in the tumors. Notably, PLK1 oncogene was expressed at very high levels in hepatoblastomas as compared to the normal infant's livers. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis for the PLK1 mRNA levels in 74 primary hepatoblastomas and 29 corresponding nontumorous livers indicated that the patients with hepatoblastoma with high expression of PLK1 represented significantly poorer outcome than those with its low expression (5-year survival rate: 55.9 vs 87.0%, respectively, p=0.042), suggesting that the level of PLK1 expression is a novel marker to predict the prognosis of hepatoblastoma. Thus, the differentially expressed genes we have identified may become a useful tool to develop new diagnostic as well as therapeutic strategies of hepatoblastoma.</text></passage></document><document><id>789</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Refinement of the locus for non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>Non-syndromic X-linked deafness is a rare form of genetic deafness in humans accounting for a small proportion of all hereditary hearing loss.

Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is defined by primary resistance to standard steroid therapy. It remains one of the most intractable causes for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the first two decades of life. Sporadic mutations in the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1 have been found to be present in patients with SRNS in association with Wilms' tumor (WT) and urinary or genital malformations, as well as in patients with isolated SRNS. METHODS: To further evaluate the incidence of WT1 mutations in patients with NS we performed mutational analysis in 115 sporadic cases of SRNS and in 110 sporadic cases of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) as a control group. Sixty out of 115 (52%) patients with sporadic SRNS were male, 55/115 (48%) were female. Sex genotype was verified by haplotype analysis. Mutational analysis was performed by direct sequencing and by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). RESULTS: Mutations in WT1 were found in 3/60 (5%) male (sex genotype) cases and 5/55 (9%) female (sex genotype) cases of sporadic SRNS, and 0/110 (0%) sporadic cases of SSNS. One out of five female patients with mutations in WT1 developed a WT, 2/3 male patients presented with the association of urinary and genital malformations, 1/3 male patients presented with sexual reversal (female phenotype) and bilateral gonadoblastoma, and 4/5 female patients presented with isolated SRNS. CONCLUSION: According to the data acquired in this study, patients presenting with a female phenotype and SRNS and male patients presenting with genital abnormalities should especially be screened to take advantage of the important genetic information on potential Wilms' tumor risk and differential therapy. This will also help to provide more data on the phenotype/genotype correlation in this patient population.</text></passage></document><document><id>792</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Lack of association of CYP1 B1*3 polymorphism and ovarian cancer in a Caucasian population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>CYP1B1 is the enzyme with the highest efficiency of conversion of estradiol to 4-hydroxyestradiol in humans. This metabolite has a well-known carcinogenic effect interacting with genomic DNA and has been hypothesized to be partly responsible for the role played by estrogens in ovarian cancer development. A polymorphism has been described for this enzyme causing a Leu to Val substitution in position 432 (CYP1B1*3). The Val432 allele has a higher efficiency of conversion of estradiol to 4-hydroxyestradiol and has been reported to increase the risk of ovarian cancer. A previous study reported a higher, significant prevalence of CYP1B1*3 polymorphism in ovarian cancer patients of mixed ethnicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CYP1B1*3 polymorphism as a risk factor for ovarian cancer in a Caucasian population. The polymorphism frequency was determined in 223 cases of ovarian cancer and compared with that of 280 healthy female blood donors. Genetic analysis was performed on genomic DNA from PBMC and RFLP methods were used for mutation detection. No significant difference between cases and controls was found. These results do not support a favoring role of CYP1B1*3 in ovarian cancer development in our population.</text></passage></document><document><id>793</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Aspartylglucosaminuria among Palestinian Arabs. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>48</offset><text>Aspartylglucosaminuria ( AGU ) is a rare disorder of glycoprotein metabolism caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase ( AGA ) .

The genotype-phenotype correlations for these APC deletions have not been studied in detail. We aimed to assess the number of germ line APC deletions in Dutch polyposis patients, to describe the clinical phenotype(s), and to review the current literature. We screened 296 index patients with polyposis, who previously had negative test results for APC or MUTYH mutations, for germ line APC gene deletions using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification. APC deletions were identified in 19 polyposis patients; seven had a whole gene deletion, nine had a deletion involving two or more exons, and three had single exon deletions. Most of the deletion families (83%) displayed a classic familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) phenotype (100-2000 adenomas). We saw no patients with APC deletions and a severe phenotype (ie >2000 polyps); on the contrary, two families carrying a deletion of exons 7-13 and one family with a deletion of exons 1-5 showed a distinctly attenuated FAP phenotype. APC deletions were found in a considerable proportion of polyposis patients previously tested negative for APC or MUTYH (6%, 19/296) and represent 8% of all APC mutations found at our clinics (19/242). Methods to identify such deletions should therefore be included in routine germ line APC mutation analysis. While most total and partial APC deletions lead to a classic FAP phenotype, specific (in-frame) deletions may lead to an attenuated polyposis phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>795</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular detection of altered X-inactivation patterns in the diagnosis of genetic disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>It is widely assumed that when a female carrier of a genetic disorder exhibits clinical signs of the disorder it is due to chance non-random X-inactivation in particular tissues.

These genes are components of the ATM-dependent DNA damage signalling pathways. To evaluate the hypothesis that variants in ATM itself might be associated with prostate cancer risk, we genotyped five ATM variants in DNA from 637 prostate cancer patients and 445 controls with no family history of cancer. No significant differences in the frequency of the variant alleles at 5557G>A (D1853N), 5558A>T (D1853V), ivs38-8t>c and ivs38-15g>c were found between the cases and controls.

A lymphoblastoid cell line carrying both the 3161G and the 2572C (858L) variant in the homozygote state shows a cell cycle progression profile after exposure to ionising radiation that is significantly different to that seen in cell lines carrying a wild-type ATM gene. These results provide evidence that the presence of common variants in the ATM gene, may confer an altered cellular phenotype, and that the ATM 3161C>G variant might be associated with prostate cancer risk.</text></passage></document><document><id>797</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Human complement factor H deficiency associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>This study reports on six cases of deficiency in the human complement regulatory protein Factor H ( FH ) in the context of an acute renal disease .

In the present study, we discovered 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2C9 by resequencing of genomic DNA from 92 individuals from three different racial groups. Haplotype analysis predicted that there are at least 21 alleles of CYP2C9 in this group of individuals. Six new alleles were identified that contained coding changes: L19I (CYP2C9*7), R150H (CYP2C9*8), H251R (CYP2C9*9), E272G (CYP2C9*10), R335W(CYP2C9*11) and P489S (CYP2C9*12). When expressed in a bacterial cDNA expression system, several alleles exhibited altered catalytic activity. CYP2C9*11 appeared to be a putative poor metabolizer allele, exhibiting a three-fold increase in the Km and more than a two-fold decrease in the intrinsic clearance for tolbutamide. Examination of the crystal structure of human CYP2C9 reveals that R335 is located in the turn between the J and J' helices and forms a hydrogen-bonding ion pair with D341 from the J' helix. Abolishing this interaction in CYP2C9*11 individuals could destabilize the secondary structure and alter the substrate affinity. This new putative poor metabolizer (PM) allele was found in Africans. A second potentially PM allele CYP2C9*12 found in a racially unidentified sample also exhibited a modest decrease in the Vmax and the intrinsic clearance for tolbutamide in a recombinant system. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the effect of these new polymorphisms on the metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates.</text></passage></document><document><id>799</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sanguinarine causes cell cycle blockade and apoptosis of human prostate carcinoma cells via modulation of cyclin kinase inhibitor-cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase machinery.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>172</offset><text>Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males in the United States. This warrants the development of novel mechanism-based strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer. Several studies have shown that plant-derived alkaloids possess remarkable anticancer effects. Sanguinarine, an alkaloid derived from the bloodroot plant Sanguinaria canadensis, has been shown to possess antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Previously, we have shown that sanguinarine possesses strong antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties against human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells and immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes. Here, employing androgen-responsive human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells and androgen-unresponsive human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells, we studied the antiproliferative properties of sanguinarine against prostate cancer. Sanguinarine (0.1-2 micromol/L) treatment of LNCaP and DU145 cells for 24 hours resulted in dose-dependent (1) inhibition of cell growth [as evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay], (2) arrest of cells in G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle (as assessed by DNA cell cycle analysis), and (3) induction of apoptosis (as evaluated by DNA ladder formation and flow cytometry). To define the mechanism of antiproliferative effects of sanguinarine against prostate cancer, we studied the effect of sanguinarine on critical molecular events known to regulate the cell cycle and the apoptotic machinery. Immunoblot analysis showed that sanguinarine treatment of both LNCaP and DU145 cells resulted in significant (1) induction of cyclin kinase inhibitors p21/WAF1 and p27/KIP1; (2) down-regulation of cyclin E, D1, and D2; and (3) down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2, 4, and 6. A highlight of this study was the fact that sanguinarine induced growth inhibitory and antiproliferative effects in human prostate carcinoma cells irrespective of their androgen status. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the involvement of cyclin kinase inhibitor-cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase machinery during cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by sanguinarine. These results suggest that sanguinarine may be developed as an agent for the management of prostate cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>800</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Congenital analbuminaemia: biochemical and clinical implications.

A review of 39 reported cases in the literature shows that the clinical symptoms are always remarkably mild and that the diagnosis is rarely made in infancy. The absence of albumin appears to be partly counterbalanced by high levels of non-albumin proteins and circulatory adaptations. However, congenital analbuminemia can have important complications: lipodystrophy and hypercholesterolaemia, possibly leading to atherosclerosis. Other possible complications reported in literature are hypercoagulability, osteoporosis, respiratory tract infections, intrauterine growth retardation and intrauterine death. Moreover, albumin-binding drugs should be used with caution. CONCLUSION: Congenital analbuminaemia is a rare disorder with remarkably mild signs and symptoms at all ages.

METHODS: The patients were followed during approximately 20 y and interviewed about symptoms, diet and physical activity. Fasting provocations, bicycle ergometer tests, dietary registrations, enzyme and mutation analysis were performed by standard protocols. RESULTS: The activity of glycerol kinase (GK) in fibroblasts was &lt;10% of reference. One case had a deletion of exon 17, the other a mutation in exon 7 of the GK gene (601 A-->G). Both mothers were heterozygotes. Two maternal male cousins in one of the families were hemizygotes without symptoms. Tests performed in childhood documented pronounced sensitivity to fasting and physical exercise, whereas such tests at 23 and 31 y of age were essentially normal but with pronounced ketonaemia. After puberty, the boys had no hypoglycaemic symptoms and now report no problems with their condition; thus, their phenotype has changed over time. CONCLUSION: The greater importance of glycerol as a gluconeogenetic substrate in children than in adults may explain the episodes in young patients with GKD, often elicited by catabolic stress. With meals at frequent intervals, access to glucose and avoidance of strenuous sports, the prognosis is good for a normal adult life of a young child with isolated GKD and symptoms of hypoglycaemia.</text></passage></document><document><id>802</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Transfer of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins to deficient cells after erythrocyte transfusion in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>148</offset><text>In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), an acquired mutation of the PIGA gene results in the absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface membrane proteins in affected hematopoietic cells. Absence of GPI-anchored proteins on erythrocytes is responsible for their increased sensitivity to complement-mediated lysis, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Cell-to-cell transfer of CD55 and CD59, 2 GPI-anchored proteins, by red cell microvesicles has been demonstrated in vitro, with retention of their function. Because red cell units stored for transfusion contain many erythrocyte microvesicles, transfused blood could potentially serve as a source of CD55 and CD59. We examined whether GPI-anchored proteins could be transferred in vivo to deficient cells following transfusions given to 6 patients with PNH. All patients were group A(1) blood type. Each was given transfusions of 3 U of compatible, washed group O blood. Patient group A(1) cells were distinguished from the transfused group O cells by flow cytometry and staining with a labeled lectin, Dolichos biflorus, which specifically binds to group A(1) erythrocytes. Increased surface CD59 was measured on recipient red cells and granulocytes 1, 3, and 7 days following transfusion in all 6 patients. Our data suggest a potential therapeutic role for GPI-anchored protein transfer for severe PNH.</text></passage></document><document><id>803</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Subterminal deletion/duplication event in an affected male due to maternal X chromosome pericentric inversion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>111</offset><text>We report a 13-month-old male infant with an apparently normal karyotype, severe growth and developmental delay, ichthyosis, hypogonadism, limb shortness, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and a round, flat face and thin upper lip as a consequence of a subtelomeric del/dup event of the X chromosome. The recombinant X chromosome (rec(X)), derived from crossing-over within the inversion, was identified in a family, in which the mother is a carrier of pericentric inversion of one X chromosome and pericentric inversion of the heterochromatic region of chromosome 9. The inv(X) chromosome was also analysed in her sister and daughter. The rec(X) had a duplication of the segment Xq27.3-->Xqter and deletion of the Xp22.31-->Xpter and was interpreted as Xqter-Xq27.3::Xp22.31-Xqter. The rec (X) was characterised by FISH using a number of BAC probes. There are only three published reports of chromosome rearrangements resulting in a similar subtelomeric duplication of Xq in males. The proband's phenotype corresponds to descriptions of contiguous gene syndromes due to deletion of the STS, SHOX, ARSE and KAL genes. Despite the loss of the ARSE gene there was no evidence of chondrodysplasia punctata. Additional conditions associated with duplication of the Xq28 segment, such as severe growth retardation and developmental delay, a peculiar head shape, atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres and hypoplasia of the cerebellum and corpus callosum, were observed. CONCLUSION: Fluorescent in situ hybridisation techniques using subtelomeric DNA probes are essential tools for detection of such complex submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements as the dup/del event of the X chromosome described in our patient.</text></passage></document><document><id>804</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Differences in FM100-Hue test performance related to iris colour may be due to pupil size as well as presumed amounts of macular pigmentation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>143</offset><text>BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the differences in macular pigment between Asian and Caucasian eyes might give rise to different performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test. However, the study did not appear to account adequately for the observation that differences were apparent only in older age groups. It was also acknowledged that other factors, like pupil size and crystalline lens colouration, could influence the result. METHOD: We investigated the performance of the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test, under standard conditions, by three groups with presumed different macular pigmentation and narrow age range. We also measured pupil size. RESULTS: The group with blue irides (presumed low macular pigmentation) performed significantly better on the colour vision task than the Asian group and the brown-eyed subjects as a whole (presumed higher macular pigmentation). In addition, the difference in pupil size between the blue-eyed group and brown-eyed groups bordered on significance. The difference in pupil size and consequential reduction in retinal illuminance account for a significant proportion of the difference in colour vision performance. In addition, a difference in both pupil size and Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test performance was also observed between males and females that reinforced the importance of pupil size, and not just macular pigment, as a factor in colour vision performance difference between Asian and non-Asian eyes. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that pupil size, not just macular pigment, may have a significant influence on colour vision performance in a young, healthy population.</text></passage></document><document><id>805</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A patient with Prader-Willi syndrome and a supernumerary marker chromosome r(15)(q11.1-13p11.1)pat and maternal heterodisomy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>We report on a Prader-Willi patient with a de novo supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) in 16% of the cells.

The disease is characterized by accumulation of aspartylglucosamine (GlcNAc-Asn) and other glycoasparagines in tissues and body fluids of AGU patients and in an AGU mouse model. In the current study, we characterized a glycoasparagine carrying the tetrasaccharide moiety of alpha-D-Man-(1-->6)-beta-D-Man-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-->N)-Asn (Man2GlcNAc2-Asn) in urine of an AGU patient and also in the tissues of the AGU mouse model. Quantitative analysis demonstrated a massive accumulation of the compound especially in nonneuronal tissues of the AGU mice, in which the levels of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn were typically 30-87% of those of GlcNAc-Asn. The highest level of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn was found in the liver, spleen, and heart tissues of the AGU mice, the respective amounts being 87%, 76%, and 57% of the GlcNAc-Asn levels. In the brain tissue of AGU mice the Man2GlcNAc2-Asn storage was only 9% of that of GlcNAc-Asn. In contrast to GlcNAc-Asn, the storage of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn markedly increased in the liver and spleen tissues of AGU mice as they grew older. Enzyme replacement therapy with glycosylasparaginase for 3.5 weeks reduced the amount of Man2GlcNAc2-Asn by 66-97% in nonneuronal tissues, but only by 13% in the brain tissue of the AGU mice. In conclusion, there is evidence for a role for storage of glycoasparagines other than aspartylglucosamine in the pathogenesis of AGU, and this possibility should be taken into consideration in the treatment of the disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>808</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>De novo repeat classification and fragment assembly.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>Repetitive sequences make up a significant fraction of almost any genome, and an important and still open question in bioinformatics is how to represent all repeats in DNA sequences.

Frataxin plays a crucial role in iron metabolism and detoxification and interacts with electron transport chain proteins. There is no effective therapy for Friedreich ataxia, but antioxidant therapy has shown promise and is currently in clinical trials. In this review we focus on the mechanisms by which expanded GAA repeats reduce transcription and discuss how these findings have lead to gene-based approaches that may be effective in treating Friedreich ataxia.</text></passage></document><document><id>810</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel missense mutation in the coagulation factor IX catalytic domain associated with severe haemophilia B--Factor IXDelhi.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease, which exists as a zymogen in the blood. On activation to factor IXa, by factor XIa or tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, it forms tenase complex with factor VIIIa, in the presence of Ca2+. This tenase complex enzymatically converts factor X to factor Xa, thereby bringing about the coagulation cascade. Mutations in factor IX gene have been shown to cause haemophilia B, which is inherited as an X-linked recessive disorder. Herein we report a novel missense mutation at the nucleotide position 30829-T > A in the exon 8 of factor IX gene. This transversion leads to the substitution of histidine 236 to glutamine. This resulting abnormal protein has been named factor IXDelhi. Molecular modelling was performed to predict the molecular pathology of this mutation. We predict that this change in the catalytic domain may affect the surface loop that accommodates Ca2+, thereby leading to severe bleeding disorder.</text></passage></document><document><id>811</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic heterogeneity in hereditary breast cancer: role of BRCA1 and BRCA2. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>The common hereditary forms of breast cancer have been largely attributed to the inheritance of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes .

We describe the proportion of hereditary breast cancer explained by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sample of North American hereditary breast cancers and assess the evidence for additional susceptibility genes that may confer hereditary breast or ovarian cancer risk . Twenty-three families were identified through two high-risk breast cancer research programs .

Mutation analysis in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was also undertaken in all families . The pattern of hereditary cancer in 14 ( 61 % ) of the 23 families studied was attributed to BRCA1 by a combination of linkage and mutation analyses . No families were attributed to BRCA2 . Five families ( 22 % ) provided evidence against linkage to both BRCA1 and BRCA2 . No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were detected in these five families . The BRCA1 or BRCA2 status of four families ( 17 % ) could not be determined . BRCA1 and BRCA2 probably explain the majority of hereditary breast cancer that exists in the North American population .

Association of LCCS2 to the known loci associated with arthogryposis was excluded. In the present study, we set out to determine the genetic locus harboring the gene defective in this disease. We performed genome-wide linkage analysis, demonstrating linkage to a approximately 6 cM (corresponding to approximately 7.2 Mb) homozygosity region on chromosome 12q13 between markers D12S1604 and D12S83. Based on recombination events, the interval harboring the disease-associated locus was further narrowed to a region spanning approximately 6 cM ( approximately 6.4 Mb) between D12S325 and D12S1072. Linkage of LCCS2 to that locus was established, with two significant maximum peaks at markers D12S1604 (Z(max) = 10.56 at theta = 0.01) and D12S1700 (Z(max) = 9.23 at theta = 0.00).</text></passage></document><document><id>813</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The Mre11 complex and ATM: a two-way functional interaction in recognising and signaling DNA double strand breaks.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>Mutations in components of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex give rise to genetic disorders characterized by neurological abnormalities, radiosensitivity, cell cycle checkpoint defects, genomic instability and cancer predisposition.

At the molecular level, the HPA-4a/4b dimorphism is associated with an arginine/ glutamine substitution at amino acid 143 of the gene encoding platelet glycoprotein IIIa. Unlike the five other major diallelic human platelet antigen systems (HPA-1, -2, -3, -5, and -6), the nucleotide substitution corresponding to the HPA-4 antigen system does not involve a common naturally occurring restriction enzyme site. This paper describes a new genotyping method for HPA-4 (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism [PCR-RFLP]) that involves restriction enzyme digestion of PCR-amplified genomic DNA using a modified PCR primer to create an artificial TaqI restriction site that is present in the HPA-4a but not in the HPA-4b DNA sequence. The HPA-4 PCR-RFLP method was validated by testing a reference panel of 10 known HPA-4 genotyped Japanese individuals. Thus, genotyping by PCR-RFLP can now be performed for all six major HPA systems. Using the HPA-4 PCR-RFLP genotyping method, we determined a frequency of 2.9 percent for the HPA-4b allele in a North American Indian population. This finding indicates the importance of the HPA-4 antigen system as a potential cause of alloimmune thrombocytopenia in American Indians.</text></passage></document><document><id>816</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[A de nono I462S mutation in the KRT6A gene is associated with pachyonychia congenita type I].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>95</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the KRT6A gene mutation and mutating patterns in a sporadic Chinese patient with Pachyonychia congenita (PC)-1 so as to provide a basis for gene diagnosis and genetic counseling of this disorder. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood by standard methods from a female patient with PC-1 and her parents, and from 50 normal, unrelated individuals. Primers for specific amplification of the structural KRT6A gene without co amplification of homologous genes were designed and synthesized. All exons of the gene and their flanking intronic sequences were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to automatic DNA sequencing. The mutation was confirmed by Mbo I restriction digestion of the KRT6A-specific PCR products. RESULTS: Direct sequencing of the PCR products revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation, I462S in the KRT6A gene, which resulted from T to G transversion at nucleotide 1385 (1385T > G) in exon 7 was detected in the patient. This mutation would result in the substitution of Isoleucine by Serine at codon 462 (I462S) located in the end 2B domain of keratin 6A. No such mutation was found in the patient's parents by sequencing of PCR products and this mutation was confirmed in the patient and excluded from both parents and 50 normal, unrelated controls by restriction analysis of PCR fragments using Mbo I enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: A de novo missense mutation in the KRT6A gene, I462S, has been found in a sporadic PC-1 patient. The identification of this novel mutation in the KRT6A gene provides further evidence that mutation in the KRT6A gene causes PC-1 phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>817</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ refilling controls recovery from Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release refractoriness in heart muscle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>In cardiac muscle Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is initiated by Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels. At present, the mechanisms underlying termination of SR Ca2+ release, which are required to ensure stable excitation-contraction coupling cycles, are not precisely known. However, the same mechanism leading to refractoriness of SR Ca2+ release could also be responsible for the termination of CICR. To examine the refractoriness of SR Ca2+ release, we analyzed Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents reflecting cytosolic Ca2+ signals induced by UV-laser flash-photolysis of caged Ca2+. Pairs of UV flashes were applied at various intervals to examine the time course of recovery from CICR refractoriness. In cardiomyocytes isolated from guinea-pigs and mice, beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol-accelerated recovery from refractoriness by approximately 2-fold. Application of cyclopiazonic acid at moderate concentrations (&lt;10 micromol/L) slowed down recovery from refractoriness in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with cells from wild-type littermates, those from phospholamban knockout (PLB-KO) mice exhibited almost 5-fold accelerated recovery from refractoriness. Our results suggest that SR Ca2+ refilling mediated by the SR Ca2+-pump corresponds to the rate-limiting step for recovery from CICR refractoriness. Thus, the Ca2+ sensitivity of CICR appears to be regulated by SR Ca2+ content, possibly resulting from a change in the steady-state Ca2+ sensitivity and in the gating kinetics of the SR Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors). During Ca2+ release, the concomitant reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity of the ryanodine receptors might also underlie Ca2+ spark termination by deactivation.</text></passage></document><document><id>818</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PDGF-A, PDGF-Rbeta, TGFbeta3 and bone morphogenic protein-4 in desmoplastic small round cell tumors with EWS-WT1 gene fusion product and their role in stromal desmoplasia: an immunohistochemical study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>202</offset><text>Histologically, desmoplastic small round cell tumor is composed of the characteristic neoplastic small round cells with divergent differentiation, and distinct desmoplastic stroma. Genetically, the tumor shows a characteristic 11;22 translocation, involving the EWS gene on chromosome 22 and the WT1gene on chromosome 11 to produce an EWS-WT1 fusion gene which generates a chimeric protein functioning as a novel transcription factor that activates expression of target genes such as PDGF-A. Expression of PDGF-A, a potent growth factor for fibroblasts, has been detected in desmoplastic small round cell tumors and has been linked to the characteristic desmoplasia in these tumors. Bone morphogenic proteins, which are members of the TGFbeta superfamily play a complex role in regulating cell growth and differentiation and bone formation but have not been evaluated in desmoplastic small round cell tumors. In all, 24 desmoplastic small round cell tumors with EWS-WT1 fusion product confirmed by RT-PCR analysis were evaluated for expression of PDGF-A, PDGF-Rbeta, TGFbeta3 and bone morphogenic protein-4 by standard immunohistochemical methods with antigen retrieval on paraffin sections. Immunoreactivity was evaluated semiquantitively. Tumor-associated desmoplasia was quantified using a three-tier scale on hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections. Desmoplastic small round cell tumors showed variable immunoreactivity with TGFbeta3 (21/24), BMP4 (14/21), PDGF-A (19/24) and PDGF-Rbeta (16/22). Less frequently, the stromal cells showed reactivity with TGFbeta3, PDGF-Rbeta and PDGF-A. Tumor-associated desmoplasia was prominent in eight, intermediate in seven and weak in nine cases. There was no correlation between tumor-associated desmoplasia and the markers tested except PDGF-A. In contrast to a previous study, our study showed that the level of PDGF-A expression inversely correlated with tumor-associated desmoplasia. Other targets of the EWS-WT1 transcription factor other than PDGF-A may be directly responsible for the prominent tumor-associated desmoplasia seen in desmoplastic small round cell tumor.</text></passage></document><document><id>819</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A mixed epigenetic/genetic model for oligogenic inheritance of autism with a limited role for UBE3A.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>The genetic contribution to autism is often attributed to the combined effects of many loci (ten or more). This conclusion is based in part on the much lower concordance for dizygotic (DZ) than for monozygotic (MZ) twins, and is consistent with the failure to find strong evidence for linkage in genome-wide studies. We propose that the twin data are compatible with oligogenic inheritance combined with a major, genetic or epigenetic, de novo component to the etiology. Based on evidence that maternal but not paternal duplications of chromosome 15q cause autism, we attempted to test the hypothesis that autism involves oligogenic inheritance (two or more loci) and that the Angelman gene (UBE3A), which encodes the E6-AP ubiquitin ligase, is one of the contributing genes. A search for epigenetic abnormalities led to the discovery of a tissue-specific differentially methylated region (DMR) downstream of the UBE3A coding exons, but the region was not abnormal in autism lymphoblasts or brain samples. Based on evidence for allele sharing in 15q among sib-pairs, abnormal DNA methylation at the 5'-CpG island of UBE3A in one of 17 autism brains, and decreased E6-AP protein in some autism brains, we propose a mixed epigenetic and genetic model for autism with both de novo and inherited contributions. The role of UBE3A may be quantitatively modest, but interacting proteins such as those ubiquitinated by UBE3A may be candidates for a larger role in an oligogenic model. A mixed epigenetic and genetic and mixed de novo and inherited (MEGDI) model could be relevant to other "complex disease traits".</text></passage></document><document><id>820</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nature of 6-methylpurine inhibition and characterization of two 6-methylpurine-resistant mutants of Neurospora crassa.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>6-Methylpurine, an analog of adenine, inhibits the growth of Neurospora crassa. From kinetic studies it was found that 6-methylpurine is converted to its nucleotide form by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7), and inhibits the de novo purine biosynthesis. Adenine relieves the growth inhibition caused by 6-methylpurine, whereas hypoxanthine is not very effective. Studies dealing with hypoxanthine utilization in the presence of 6-methylpurine indicated a severely reduced uptake of hypoxanthine and a general slowdown in its further metabolism. Two mutants (Mepr-3 and Mepr-10) which are resistant to 6-methylpurine were characterized. Studies of purine base uptake and the in vivo and in vitro conversion to nucleotides indicated that Mepr-10 may be an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase-defective mutant, whereas Mepr-3 may be a mutant with altered feedback response to 6-methylpurine. Both mutants showed a severely lowered hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase activity, but because 6-methylpurine did not have any effect on the conversion of hypoxanthine to IMP in the wild type, it was concluded that 6-methylpurine resistance in these mutants cannot be due to lowered hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase activity, but rather that the lowering of enzyme activity may be a secondary effect.</text></passage></document><document><id>821</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>p73 expression for human buccal epithelial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma: does it correlate with nodal status of carcinoma and is there a relationship with malignant change of epithelial dysplasia?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>206</offset><text>BACKGROUND: TP73, a p53 homologue gene, shares similar structural sequences with p53. The aim of this study was to investigate the p73 expression for human buccal epithelial dysplasia (ED) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: Seventy-five samples of human buccal ED, including mild, moderate, and severe ED (25 samples in each category), were analyzed for p73 protein expression by means of immunohistochemistry. Twenty-five samples of human buccal SCCs were analyzed for p73 mRNA expression with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were also analyzed for protein expression with immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: By use of immunohistochemical analysis, nuclear staining of p73 protein was detected in a subset of normal mucosa, buccal ED, and SCC specimens. p73 nuclear staining was noted for the basal cells of normal buccal mucosa. For buccal lesions deriving from mild, moderate, and severe ED, p73 protein was observed in basal and parabasal layers and in more superficial cell layers corresponding to the spinous layer. For well-differentiated carcinomas, p73 immunoreactivity was chiefly observed among the less-differentiated cells in the periphery of carcinomatous clusters, whereas moderately differentiated carcinomas revealed homogeneous staining, involving nearly all of the tumor cells. On RT-PCR, the expression of p73 mRNA from buccal SCC was noted to be compatible with the findings of immunohistochemical analysis. An electrophoretic band with a 180-bp PCR product corresponding to p73 mRNA has been observed. The expression of p73 seemed to be significantly elevated for specimens of buccal ED (protein level) and SCC (protein and mRNA levels) compared with the analogous expression for normal control tissue (Fisher's exact test, p &lt;.001). Also, p73 expression (protein and mRNA levels) correlated significantly with cervical lymph node metastasis for cases of buccal SCC (Fisher's exact test, p &lt;.001). Eight cases of ED (protein level) showing p73 positivity have undergone malignant transformation to develop SCCs in 2 years follow-up, but no statistical significance was established (Fisher's exact test, p >.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that p73 expression may be (1) associated with the differentiation of oral stratified squamous epithelium, (2) an early event in human oral carcinogenesis, and (3) associated with the nodal status of patients with oral carcinoma and a possible indicator for malignant change of oral ED.</text></passage></document><document><id>822</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Chromosome 19p13 loci in Finnish migraine with aura families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>62</offset><text>Chromosomal area 19p13 contains two migraine associated genes: a Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channel alpha(1) subunit gene, CACNA1A, and an insulin receptor gene, INSR. Missense mutations in CACNA1A cause a rare Mendelian form of migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). Contribution of CACNA1A locus has also been studied in the common forms of migraine, migraine with (MA) and without aura (MO), but the results have been contradictory. The role of INSR is less well established: A region on 19p13 separate from CACNA1A was recently reported to be a major locus for migraine and subsequently, the INSR gene was associated with MA and MO. Our aim was to clarify the role of these loci in MA families by analyzing 72 multigenerational Finnish MA families, the largest family sample so far. We hypothesized that the potential major contribution of the 19p13 loci should be detected in a family sample of this size, and this was confirmed by simulations. We genotyped eight polymorphic microsatellite markers surrounding the INSR and CACNA1A genes on 757 individuals. Using parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis, none of the studied markers showed any evidence of linkage to MA either under locus homogeneity or heterogeneity. However, marginally positive lod scores were observed in three families, and thus for these families the results remain inconclusive. The overall conclusion is that our study did not provide evidence of a major MA susceptibility region on 19p13 and thus we were not able to replicate the INSR locus finding.</text></passage></document><document><id>823</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Tumour characteristics and prognosis of breast cancer patients carrying the germline CHEK2*1100delC variant.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>BACKGROUND: The germline CHEK2*1100delC variant has been associated with breast cancer in multiple case families where involvement of BRCA1 and BRCA2 has been excluded. METHODS: We have investigated the tumour characteristics and prognosis of carriers of this germline variant by means of a prospective cohort study in an unselected cohort of 1084 consecutive patients with primary breast cancer. Data were collected for 34 patients with a germline CHEK2*1100delC mutation and for 102 patients without this mutation, stratified by age and date of diagnosis of the first primary breast cancer (within 1 year). RESULTS: Carriers developed steroid receptor positive tumours (oestrogen receptor (ER): 91%; progesterone receptor (PR): 81%) more frequently than non-carriers (ER: 69%; PR: 53%; p = 0.04). Mutation carriers more frequently had a female first or second degree relative with breast cancer (p = 0.03), or had any first or second degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer (p = 0.04). Patients with the CHEK2 variant had a more unfavourable prognosis regarding the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (relative risk (RR) = 5.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 19.65), distant metastasis-free survival (RR = 2.81; 95% CI 1.20 to 6.58), and disease-free survival (RR = 3.86; 95% CI 1.91 to 7.78). As yet, no difference with respect to overall survival has been found at a median follow up of 3.8 years. CONCLUSION: We conclude that carrying the CHEK2*1100delC mutation is an adverse prognostic indicator for breast cancer. If independently confirmed by others, intensive surveillance, and possibly preventive measures, should be considered for newly diagnosed breast cancer cases carrying the CHEK2*1100delC variant.</text></passage></document><document><id>824</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nijmegen breakage syndrome and DNA double strand break repair by NBS1 complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>The isolation of the NBS1 gene revealed the molecular mechanisms of DSB repair. In response to DNA damage, histone H2AX in the vicinity of DSBs is phosphorylated by ATM. NBS1 then targets the MRE11/RAD50 complex to the sites of DSBs through interaction of the FHA/BRCT domain with gamma-H2AX. NBS1 complex binds to damaged-DNA directly, and HR repair is initiated. To collaborate DSB repair, ATM also regulates cell cycle checkpoints at G1, G2, and intra-S phases via phosphorylation of SMC, CHK2 and FANCD2. The phosphorylation of these proteins require NBS1 complex. Thus, NBS1 has at least two important roles in genome maintenance, as a DNA repair protein in HR pathway and as a signal modifier in intra-S phase checkpoints. NBS1 is also known to be involved in maintenance of telomeres, which have DSB-like structures and defects here can cause telomeric fusion. Therefore, NBS1 should be a multifunctional protein for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Further studies on NBS1 will provide insights into the mechanisms of DNA damage response and the network of these factors involved in genomic stability.</text></passage></document><document><id>825</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>26</offset><text>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is caused by mutations of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein gene, which codes for a cytoplasmic protein with multiple functions. This review will focus on recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and its ramifications for the cure of this lethal disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The discovery of the causative gene has revealed a spectrum of clinical phenotypes demonstrating a strong genotype/phenotype correlation. The discovery of unique functional domains of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein has been instrumental in defining mechanisms that control activation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Long-term follow up of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has led to important modifications of the procedure. Studies of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-deficient cell lines and wasp-knockout mice have paved the way for possible gene therapy. SUMMARY: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein gene mutations result in four clinical phenotypes: classic Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked thrombocytopenia, intermittent thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is a signaling molecule and instrumental for cognate and innate immunity, cell motility and protection against autoimmune disease. The success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is related to the recipient's age, donor selection, the conditioning regimen and the extent of reconstitution. Since Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic stem cells, and because Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein exerts a strong selective pressure, gene therapy is expected to cure the disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>826</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nucleotide sequence analysis of human tpr cDNA clones.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>55</offset><text>In this study we have characterized cDNA clones corresponding to a gene, called tpr, that has been implicated in the activation of the met and raf proto-oncogenes.

In addition we have established that alternative splicing can result in the deletion of a 30 bp sequence that spans the translation termination site of this ORF. This modification generates mRNAs encoding a tpr protein that has an extended C-terminal domain. The 726 amino acid tpr protein is predicted to have extensive regions of alpha-helix and has three stretches of a heptad repeat motif that is characteristic of proteins adopting a coiled-coil conformation.

It is characterized by a high concentration of low density lipoprotein (LDL), which frequently gives rise to tendon xanthenes and premature coronary artery disease. We studied a FH family ,which was diagnosed by clinical features and blood lipid tests. The Total cholesterol level of the family was 19.05 mmol/L and the LDL level was 17.06 mmol/L in the proband homozygous FH subjects, while the total cholesterol was 7.96 mmol/L and LDL was 5.55 mmol/L in the heterozygous FH subjects. DNA segments amplified with PCR were sequenced in heterozygous and homozygous FH patients. Two novel identical mutation alleles of GAG683GCG, which caused an amino acid change from Glu to Ala, were detected in Exon4 of LDL receptor gene in homozygous proband. DNA sequencing revealed that the proband's parents were heterozygotes with the same mutational alleles as the proband. These results are in coincidence with the clinical diagnoses. Moreover Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocytes (EBV-Ls) were derived by routine virus infection transforming protocol. The cells bounded with the fluorescently conjugated LDL were measured by fluorescence flow cytometry. The ratios of functional LDLR in EBV-Ls originated from homozygous FH, heterozygous FH and normal control were 7.02%, 62.64% and 84.69%, respectively. As a result, the homozygous FH patient's LDLR had 8.29% and the heterozygous FH patient's LDLR had 73.96% of the activity of the control. It is apparent that LDL receptor activity of homozygous FH subject is significantly lower than normal control. The data from fluorescence flow cytometry analysis of EBV-Ls strongly support the clinical diagnoses and the results of DNA sequencing. In accordance with the updated version of UMD-LDLR, the mutant GAG683GCG in Exon4 of LDLR gene which we have identified is a novel mutation of the LDLR gene in human with hypercholesterolemia.</text></passage></document><document><id>828</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genomic organization of the UBE3A/E6-AP gene and related pseudogenes. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>The UBE3A gene encodes the E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase and has recently been shown to be mutated in Angelman syndrome patients who lack 15q11-q13 deletions or chromosome 15 paternal uniparental disomy .

The purpose of this study was to explore a potential therapeutic approach for this subset of patients by using aminoglycosides to induce PTC read-through, thereby restoring levels of full-length ATM (A-T mutated) protein. In experiments using a modified in vitro cDNA coupled transcription/translation protein truncation test, 13 A-T cell lines carrying PTC mutations in different contexts exhibited read-through expression of ATM fragments, with three of four aminoglycosides tested. In ex vivo experiments with lymphoblastoid cell lines, we used radiosensitivity, radioresistant DNA synthesis, and irradiation-induced autophosphorylation of ATM Ser-1981 to show that the aminoglycoside-induced full-length ATM protein was functional and corrected, to various extents, the phenotype of A-T cells. These results encourage further testing of other compounds in this class, as well as follow up animal studies. Because some A-T patients with 5-20% of normal levels of ATM protein show slower neurological progression, A-T may prove to be a good model for aminoglycoside-induced read-through therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>830</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Buenos Aires: a novel de novo missense mutation associated with severe enzyme deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: : Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes the first committed steps in the pentose phosphate pathway: the generation of NADPH by this enzyme is essential for protection against oxidative stress. The human enzyme is in a dimer&lt;-->tetramer equilibrium and its stability depends on NADP(+) concentration. Herein, we report a case of a symptomatic baby affected by severe deficiency of G6PD activity due to a novel de novo genetic mutation (g1465C>T) in the thirteenth exon of its gene. METHODS: : Clinical, biochemical and genetic evaluations of the affected baby and his mother were performed. RESULTS: : We found the g1465C>T novel mutation, in the thirteenth exon of G6PD gene (named "G6PD Buenos Aires variant"). This g1465C>T mutation produce a P489S substitution at protein level. The P489S mutation was absent in his mother, suggesting that G6PD Buenos Aires resulted from a de novo mutation. CONCLUSIONS: : The absence of mosaicism in the baby's DNA (from saliva and blood samples) suggests that a de novo mutation event may occur in the very early stages in embryogenesis or in the mother's germ cell lines.</text></passage></document><document><id>831</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The Wt1+/R394W mouse displays glomerulosclerosis and early-onset renal failure characteristic of human Denys-Drash syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>Renal failure is a frequent and costly complication of many chronic diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. One common feature of renal failure is glomerulosclerosis, the pathobiology of which is unclear. To help elucidate this, we generated a mouse strain carrying the missense mutation Wt1 R394W, which predisposes humans to glomerulosclerosis and early-onset renal failure (Denys-Drash syndrome [DDS]). Kidney development was normal in Wt1(+/R394W) heterozygotes. However, by 4 months of age 100% of male heterozygotes displayed proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis characteristic of DDS patients. This phenotype was observed in an MF1 background but not in a mixed B6/129 background, suggestive of the action of a strain-specific modifying gene(s). WT1 encodes a nuclear transcription factor, and the R394W mutation is known to impair this function. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of Wt1 R394W-induced renal failure, the expression of genes whose deletion leads to glomerulosclerosis (NPHS1, NPHS2, and CD2AP) was quantitated. In mutant kidneys, NPHS1 and NPHS2 were only moderately downregulated (25 to 30%) at birth but not at 2 or 4 months. Expression of CD2AP was not changed at birth but was significantly upregulated at 2 and 4 months. Podocalyxin was downregulated by 20% in newborn kidneys but not in kidneys at later ages. Two other genes implicated in glomerulosclerosis, TGFB1 and IGF1, were upregulated at 2 months and at 2 and 4 months, respectively. It is not clear whether the significant alterations in gene expression are a cause or a consequence of the disease process. However, the data do suggest that Wt1 R394W-induced glomerulosclerosis may be independent of downregulation of the genes for NPHS1, NPHS2, CD2AP, and podocalyxin and may involve other genes yet to be implicated in renal failure. The Wt1(R394W) mouse recapitulates the pathology and disease progression observed in patients carrying the same mutation, and the mutation is completely penetrant in male animals. Thus, it will be a powerful and biologically relevant model for investigating the pathobiology of the earliest events in glomerulosclerosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>832</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Modelling the Rayleigh match.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>30</offset><text>We use the photopigment template of Baylor et al. (1987) to define the set of Rayleigh matches that would be satisfied by a photopigment having a given wavelength of peak sensitivity (lambda(max)) and a given optical density (OD). For an observer with two photopigments in the region of the Rayleigh primaries, the observer's unique match is defined by the intersection of the sets of matches that satisfy the individual pigments. The use of a template allows us to illustrate the general behavior of Rayleigh matches as the absorption spectra of the underlying spectra are altered. In a plot of the Y setting against the red-green ratio (R), both an increase in lambda(max) and an increase in optical density lead to an anticlockwise rotation of the locus of the matches satisfied by a given pigment. Since both these factors affect the match, it is not possible to reverse the analysis and define uniquely the photopigments corresponding to a specific Rayleigh match. However, a way to constrain the set of candidate photopigments would be to determine the trajectory of the change of match as the effective optical density is altered (by, say, bleaching or field size).</text></passage></document><document><id>833</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>No genetic linkage or molecular evidence for involvement of the PCSK9, ARH or CYP7A1 genes in the Familial Hypercholesterolemia phenotype in a sample of Danish families without pathogenic mutations in the LDL receptor and apoB genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>234</offset><text>A locus on chromosome 1p34.1-p32 has been linked to autosomal dominant Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) and is termed the third FH locus.

We could exclude the third FH locus as a cause of FH by genetic linkage analysis in the families taken together. Since haplotype analysis of each family nevertheless suggested that the FH phenotype co-segregated in a manner consistent with linkage to the third FH locus in three small pedigrees, we performed sequencing analysis without being able to demonstrate mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene, the main candidate gene in the third FH locus. By the same combination of genetic linkage and molecular analysis we could also exclude mutations in the gene for the LDL receptor adaptor protein and in the gene for cholesterol-7-alpha-hydroxylase as causes of FH in our sample. Although not indicating linkage to any known loci, our data still indicate that another dominant gene may be involved in causing a FH phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>834</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Intrafamilial variability of the deafness and goiter phenotype in Pendred syndrome caused by a T416P mutation in the SLC26A4 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>Pendred syndrome (PS) is the most common cause of syndromic deafness, accounting for more than 5% of all autosomal-recessive hearing loss cases. It is characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and by goiter with or without hypothyroidism. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene cause both classical PS and deafness associated with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct without goiter. To investigate a possible genotype-phenotype correlation in PS, we performed a detailed clinical and genetic study in three adult German sibs with typical PS caused by a common homozygous SLC26A4 mutation, T416P. An audiological long-term follow-up of 23 yr showed that the mutation T416P is associated with a distinct type of hearing loss in each of the three sibs: moderate-to-profound progressive deafness, profound nonprogressive deafness, and a milder but more rapidly progressing form. We show that these phenotypic differences are not caused by either different degrees of inner ear malformations or sequence variations in the GJB2/connexin 26 gene. Because the thyroid phenotype was also highly variable within the family, with thyroid sizes ranging from normal to large goiters requiring thyroidectomy, this study leads to the conclusion that other environmental and/or genetic factors have an impact on the PS phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>835</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Inherited deficiencies of the terminal components of human complement.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>71</offset><text>The particularly frequent occurrence of terminal complement deficiencies in patients with Neisserial infections suggests that the cytolytic activity of the complement system is important in resistance to Neisseria meningitidis. There are, however, geographical differences in the prevalence of terminal complement deficiency in patients with meningococcal disease. The data available suggest that either recurrent infection or infection with uncommon serogroups should alert the clinician in Western countries whereas recurrent disease is the important indicator in high risk endemic or epidemic areas. An association of terminal complement deficiencies with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases or non-Neisserial infections is doubtful. For a better understanding of complement deficiencies in relation to disease more accurate characterization of the defects involved will be helpful. Sensitive ELISA techniques and molecular biological assays will be needed. Thus it has been established that two types of deficiencies exist (at least for C6, C7 and C8): one with low but detectable amounts of the component and the other with a complete absence of the protein in question. The subtotal variety appears to show less association with Neisserial infection. Low amounts of functional terminal complement activity may be sufficient for many of its biological functions, suggesting that there is a wide "safety margin".</text></passage></document><document><id>836</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evolutionary implications of pericentromeric gene expression in humans.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>Human pericentromeric sequences are enriched for recent sequence duplications. The continual creation and shuffling of these duplications can create novel intron-exon structures and it has been suggested that these regions have a function as gene nurseries. However, these sequences are also rich in satellite repeats which can repress transcription, and analyses of chromosomes 10 and 21 have suggested that they are transcript poor. Here, we investigate the relationship between pericentromeric duplication and transcription by analyzing the in silico transcriptional profiles within the proximal 1.5 Mb of genomic sequence on all human chromosome arms in relation to duplication status. We identify an approximately 5x excess of transcripts specific to cancer and/or testis in pericentromeric duplications compared to surrounding single copy sequence, with the expression of >50% of all transcripts in duplications being restricted to these tissues. We also identify an approximately 5x excess of transcripts in duplications which contain large quantities of interspersed repeats. These results indicate that the transcriptional profiles of duplicated and single copy sequences within pericentromeric DNA are distinct, suggesting that pericentromeric instability is unlikely to represent a common route for gene creation but may have a disproportionate effect upon genes whose function is restricted to the germ line.</text></passage></document><document><id>837</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation of MSH3 in endometrial cancer and evidence for its functional role in heteroduplex repair. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Many human tumours have length alterations in repetitive sequence elements .

To better understand the molecular basis of evolutionary chromosome rearrangements, we performed molecular cytogenetic and sequence analyses of the breakpoint region that distinguishes human chromosome 3p12.3 and orangutan chromosome 2. FISH with region-specific BAC clones demonstrated that the breakpoint-flanking sequences are duplicated intrachromosomally on orangutan 2 and human 3q21 as well as at many pericentromeric and subtelomeric sites throughout the genomes. Breakage and rearrangement of the human 3p12.3-homologous region in the orangutan lineage were associated with a partial loss of duplicated sequences in the breakpoint region. Consistent with our FISH mapping results, computational analysis of the human chromosome 3 genomic sequence revealed three 3p12.3-paralogous sequence blocks on human chromosome 3q21 and smaller blocks on the short arm end 3p26-->p25. This is consistent with the view that sequences from an ancestral site at 3q21 were duplicated at 3p12.3 in a common ancestor of orangutan and humans. Our results show that evolutionary chromosome rearrangements are associated with microduplications and microdeletions, contributing to the DNA differences between closely related species.</text></passage></document><document><id>839</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>MBNL1 is the primary determinant of focus formation and aberrant insulin receptor splicing in DM1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>In myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1), aggregation of the mutant DMPK RNA into RNA-protein complexes containing MBNL1 and MBNL2 has been linked to aberrant splicing of the insulin receptor (IR) RNA. In a parallel line of investigation, elevated levels of CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP) have been shown to result in altered IR splicing in DM1. The relative importance of MBNL1, MBNL2, and CUG-BP in DM1 pathogenesis is, however, unclear. Here we have demonstrated that either small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of MBNL1 and MBNL2 or the overexpression of CUG-BP in normal myoblasts results in abnormal IR splicing. Our results suggest that CUG-BP regulates the equilibrium of splice site selection by antagonizing the facilitatory activity of MBNL1 and MBNL2 on IR exon 11 splicing in a dose-dependent manner. We have shown that CUG-BP levels are elevated in DM1 cells by mechanisms that are independent of MBNL1 and MBNL2 loss. Importantly, rescue experiments in DM1 myoblasts demonstrated that loss of MBNL1 function is the key event, whereas the overexpression of CUG-BP plays a secondary role in the aberrant alternative splicing of IR RNA in DM1. Small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of MBNL1, MBNL2, and CUG-BP in DM1 myoblasts demonstrated that MBNL1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of DM1 focus integrity. Thus, these experiments demonstrate that sequestration of MBNL1 by the expanded CUG repeats is the primary determinant of both DM1 focus formation and the abnormal splicing of the IR RNA in DM1 myoblasts. The data therefore support MBNL1-mediated therapy for DM1.</text></passage></document><document><id>840</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Iron storage disease].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>24</offset><text>Iron overload causes impaired function of tissues and organs due to the increased iron storage in them. Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most frequent hereditary metabolic disorder, with lethal outcome without treatment. The genetic disorder is a mutation on the short arm of the 6. chromosome, which resulted a cysteine-tyrosine substitution on the 282. amino acid position (C282Y). This mutation is less frequent in the non-Caucasian population, in opposition to the other reported mutation (H63D). The risk of the development of the disease is the highest in people who are C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. The prevalence of hemochromatosis is 1.5-5.9 per thousand. Liver disease/cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and hyperpigmentation are the classic signs of the disease. Primer hepatocellular cancer occurs in 30% of patients with liver cirrhosis, that it is the most common cause of death among them. The diagnosis is based on the detection of iron overload (transferrin saturation, serum ferritin level, iron concentration of the liver tissue) and on the genetic examinations. Early diagnosis makes the causal therapy possible, which is the removal of the iron excess by phlebotomy. Furthermore, the early detection of iron overload allows of prevention of the development of the disease. Based in these facts population screening seems to be necessary and cost-effective, but further studies are required to determine the exact screening strategy.</text></passage></document><document><id>841</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The molecular triad OPG/RANK/RANKL: involvement in the orchestration of pathophysiological bone remodeling.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>The past decade has seen an explosion in the field of bone biology. The area of bone biology over this period of time has been marked by a number of key discoveries that have opened up entirely new areas for investigation. The recent identification of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), its cognate receptor RANK, and its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) has led to a new molecular perspective on osteoclast biology and bone homeostasis. Specifically, the interaction between RANKL and RANK has been shown to be required for osteoclast differentiation. The third protagonist, OPG, acts as a soluble receptor antagonist for RANKL that prevents it from binding to and activating RANK. Any dysregulation of their respective expression leads to pathological conditions such as bone tumor-associated osteolysis, immune disease, or cardiovascular pathology. In this context, the OPG/RANK/RANKL triad opens novel therapeutic areas in diseases characterized by excessive bone resorption. The present article is an update and extension of an earlier review published by Kwan Tat et al. [Kwan Tat S, Padrines M, Theoleyre S, Heymann D, Fortun Y.

SW620 cells, a human colorectal carcinoma cell line, were transfected with PcDNA3.1-DPC4 plasmid using lipofectamine transfecting technique. Transfected cells were selected with G418. Expression of Smad4 protein was detected in cells transfected with DPC4 gene by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Biological characterristics of transfected cells were evaluated by population-doubling time and cloning efficiency. Alterations of percentage of S phage cells (S%) and apoptosis rate were determined by flow- cytometry. RESULTS: PcDNA3.1-DPC4 plasmid was constructed successfully. SW620 cells transfected with PcDNA3.1-DPC4 plasmid (DPC4+-SW620 cells) showed a strong intracellular expression of Smad4 protein, and the positive signal was localized in cytoplasm and nuclei, mainly in cytoplasm, where the expressions of Smad4 protein in SW620 cells transfected with PcDNA3.1 plasmid (PcDNA3.1-SW620 cells) and non-transfected SW620 cells (SW620 cells) were weaker than those in DPC4+-SW620 cells. The population- doubling time in DPC4+-SW620 cells (116 h) was significantly longer than that in SW620 cells (31 h) and PcDNA3.1-Sw620 cells (29 h) (P&lt;0.01). The cloning efficiencies of DPC4+-SW620 cells (12%) were markedly lower than those of SW620 cells (69%) and PcDNA3.1-Sw620 cells (67%) (P&lt;0.01). Compared with SW620 cells and PcDNA3.1-Sw620 cells, the G0-G1% of DPC4+-SW620 cells was obviously higher and the S% was markedly lower (P&lt;0.05). Apoptosis rate of DPC4+-SW620 cells was significantly higher than that of SW620 cells and PcDNA3.1-SW620 cells.

Given the ability of expanded polyglutamine (poly-Q) tract present in Htt protein to interact with other proteins and increased neuronal cell death by apoptosis, variations in the genes coding for htt-interacting proteins and those involved in apoptosis are likely to alter the AO in HD. In the present investigation, we studied two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely, R72P in TP53 gene coding for transcription factor p53, which interacts with Htt protein and R196K in human caspase activated DNase (hCAD) gene involved in apoptosis to investigate their role as genetic modifiers of the AO of HD. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that variations in TP53 and hCAD genes explained 12.6% and 6%, respectively, of the variance in the AO of HD after accounting for the effect of expanded CAG repeats. Statistical analysis further showed a significant effect of the interaction term between expanded CAG repeats and variations at each of TP53 and hCAD genes upon the AO. This data demonstrated that variations in TP53 and hCAD genes modulate the AO of HD.</text></passage></document><document><id>850</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The incidence of PAX6 mutation in patients with simple aniridia: an evaluation of mutation detection in 12 cases. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>114</offset><text>Twelve aniridia patients , five with a family history and seven presumed to be sporadic , were exhaustively screened in order to test what proportion of people with aniridia , uncomplicated by associated anomalies , carry mutations in the human PAX6 gene .

Nonetheless, only sporadic reports of hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) have been reported to date. We describe an 8 year-old Sicilian boy who suffered from hemolytic anemia some days after admission for DM1. On admission, acid-base equilibrium was normal but 4 days later he presented hemolytic anemia with G6PD deficiency, confirmed by personal and family history and laboratory evaluation. We suggest that the hemolytic crisis in this patient was triggered by the relative hypoglycemia that followed insulin administration. The interference of acidosis, infections, drugs, food or other triggering agents was excluded. This report demonstrates that hemolysis may represent a possible complication of DM treatment in patients with G6PD deficiency and we recommend careful clinical surveillance in these patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>852</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial non-syndromic cleft lip and palate--analysis of the IRF6 gene and clinical phenotypes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>The aim of this study was to characterize Swedish families with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P) for mutations or other sequence variants in the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene, as well as to describe their cleft phenotypes and hypodontia. Seventeen Swedish families with at least two family members with NSCL/P were identified and clinically evaluated. Extracted DNA from blood samples was used for IRF6 mutation screening. Exonic fragments of the IRF6 gene were sequenced and chromatograms were inspected. Statistical analysis was undertaken with marker- and haplotype association tests. No disease-associated IRF6 mutation could be determined in the families analyzed. One new and seven known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected. The A allele of SNP rs861019 in exon 2 and the G allele of SNP rs7552506 in intron 3 showed association with cleft lip and palate (CLP; odds ratios of 3.1 and 5.45, respectively). Hypodontia was observed more commonly in individuals affected with CL/P as compared with family members without a cleft (P &lt; 0.01). The hypodontia most often affected the cleft area, possibly representing a secondary effect. The distribution of cleft phenotypes in 15 of the 17 families with NSCL/P differed from the mixed cleft types seen in Van der Woude syndrome (VWS), in that CLP did not occur together with an isolated cleft palate within the same family. It was concluded that mutations of the IRF6 gene are not a common cause for cleft predisposition in Swedish NSCL/P families.</text></passage></document><document><id>853</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Low incidence of BRCA2 mutations in breast carcinoma and other cancers. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>Inherited mutant alleles of familial tumour suppressor genes predispose individuals to particular types of cancer .

This finding suggests that other genes may be the principal targets for somatic mutation in breast carcinoma . A second , recently identified familial breast cancer gene , BRCA2 ( refs 5-8 ) , accounts for a proportion of breast cancer roughly equal to BRCA1 .

The BRCA2 coding sequence is huge , composed of 26 exons that span 10 , 443 bp . Here we investigate the rate of BRCA2 mutation in sporadic breast cancers and in a set of cell lines that represent twelve other tumour types .

In this study, we sought to establish the use of immature neural cells derived from adult tissues as a novel model of fragile X syndrome that could be used to more fully understand the pathology of this neurogenetic disease. METHODS: By modifying published methods for the harvest of neural progenitor cells from the post-mortem human brain, neural cells were successfully harvested and grown from post-mortem brain tissue of a 25-year-old adult male with fragile X syndrome, and from brain tissue of a patient with no neurological disease. RESULTS: The cultured fragile X cells displayed many of the characteristics of neural progenitor cells, including nestin and CD133 expression, as well as the biochemical hallmarks of fragile X syndrome, including CGG repeat expansion and a lack of FMRP expression. CONCLUSION: The successful production of neural cells from an individual with fragile X syndrome opens a new avenue for the scientific study of the molecular basis of this disorder, as well as an approach for studying the efficacy of new therapeutic agents.</text></passage></document><document><id>855</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hematopoietic-specific lentiviral vectors circumvent cellular toxicity due to ectopic expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>Efficient and safe gene modification of hematopoietic stem cells is a requirement for gene therapy of primary immunodeficiencies such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. However, deregulated expression or ectopic expression in the progeny of transduced nonhematopoietic progenitor cells may lead to unwanted toxicity. We therefore analyzed the effect of ectopic expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) and the potential benefits of hematopoietic-specific lentiviral vectors (driven by the WAS proximal promoter). Overexpression of WASp by constitutive lentiviral vectors is highly toxic in nonhematopoietic cells because it causes dramatic changes in actin localization and polymerization that result in decreased cell viability, as evidenced by a significant growth disadvantage of WASp-overexpressing nonhematopoietic cells and increased cell death. These toxic effects do not affect cells of hematopoietic origin because, remarkably, we found that WASp cannot be readily overexpressed in T cells, even after multiple vector integrations per cell. The adverse cellular effects found after transduction of nonhematopoietic cells with constitutive lentiviral vectors are overcome by the use of transcriptionally targeted lentiviral vectors expressing WASp, which, at the same time, are efficient tools for gene therapy of WAS as demonstrated by their ability to reconstitute cellular defects from WASp-deficient mouse and human cells. We therefore postulate that transcriptionally regulated lentiviral vectors represent a safer and efficient alternative for the development of clinical protocols of WAS gene therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>856</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cytokeratins and carcinoembryonic antigen in diagnosis, staging and prognosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>AIM: To evaluate the serum levels of cytokeratins and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in diagnosis, staging and prognosis of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The sample consisted of 169 patients. One hundred blood donors formed the control group. Radical surgery was performed on 120 patients, with an average follow-up duration of 22.3 mo. Relapses occurred in 23 individuals after an average of 18.09 mo. CEA was assayed via the Delfia method with a limit of 5 ng/mL. Cytokeratins were assayed via the LIA-mat TPA-M Prolifigen method with a limit of 72 U/L. RESULTS: In the diagnosis of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, CEA showed a sensitivity of 56%, a specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value of 94%, a negative predictive value of 50% and an accuracy of 76.8%. TPA-M had a sensitivity of 70%, a specificity of 96%, a positive predictive value of 97%, a negative predictive value of 66% and an accuracy of 93.6%. The elevation of one of the markers was shown to have a sensitivity of 76.9%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 93.5%, a negative predictive value of 70% and an accuracy of 83.6%. There was no variation in the levels of the markers according to the degree of cell differentiation while there was an elevation in their concentrations in accordance with the increase in neoplastic dissemination. There was a statistically significant difference between the patients with stage IV lesions and those with stages I, II and III tumors. With regard to CEA, the average level was 14.2 ng/mL in patients with stage I lesions, 8.5 ng/mL in patients with stage II lesions, 8.0 ng/mL in patients with stage III lesions and 87.7 ng/mL in patients with stage IV lesions. In relation to TPA-M, the levels were 153.1 U/L in patients with stage I tumors, 106.5 U/L in patients with stage II tumors, 136.3 U/L in patients with stage III tumors and 464.3 U/L in patients with stage IV tumors. There was a statistical difference in patients with a high CEA level in relation to a shorter survival (P&lt;0.05). However, there was no correlation between patients with high TPA-M levels and prognostic indices of patients undergoing radical surgery. CONCLUSION: Cytokeratins demonstrate a greater sensitivity than CEA in the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma. There is an increase in the sensitivity of the markers with tumor dissemination. Cytokeratins cannot identify the worse prognosis in patients undergoing radical surgery. Cytokeratins constitute an advance in the direction of a perfect tumor marker in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>857</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>From electrophysiology to chromatin: a bottom-up approach to Angelman syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Angelman syndrome is one of the most studied human diseases related to a gene that is expressed on the maternal chromosome only in at least some brain cells. It is caused by inactivation of the UBE3A gene in the brain due to various abnormalities of the 15q11-q13 chromosome inherited from the mother. It is characterized by severe developmental delay, seizures, virtual absence of speech, motor impairment, and a particular behavioral phenotype. Studies of cortical, electromyographic and cerebellar electrophysiology in patients with Angelman syndrome and a mouse model revealed unique rhythmic neurophysiological activities in the cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex, and muscles. The oscillatory patterns may be linked to molecular pathophysiology of the syndrome involving dysregulation of synaptic neurotransmission through UBE3A-related modulation of functional GABAA receptor complexes.</text></passage></document><document><id>858</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Detection of mutations in the glycine decarboxylase gene in patients with nonketotic hyperglycinaemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (NKH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of glycine metabolism caused by a deficiency in the mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme.

Previous studies searching for causative mutations in NKH patients have only looked for a limited number of specific mutations or only screened part of the gene, and in many cases either no mutation or only one mutation was found, which is of limited use for prenatal diagnosis. In this study, we describe the screening of the entire GLDC gene in 3 NKH families by D-HPLC analysis of all 25 exons, identifying two point mutations and two large deletions (exon 8 and exons 2-15) using a combination of D-HPLC analysis, long range PCR, Southern blot and sequencing. For complete prenatal testing both mutations need to be identified, and we suggest that screening of the entire gene as well as deletional analysis should be considered in those subjects where only one mutation has been identified.</text></passage></document><document><id>859</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The Wolfram syndrome: a primary neurodegenerative disorder with lethal potential.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset><text>We describe four cases of the Wolfram syndrome; a rare congenital syndrome characterised in it's complete form by diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy, nerve deafness and dilatation of the urinary tract.

Several studies have focused on the differences between frequency of the mutations and their phenotypical manifestations. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether or not this phenotypical variation is associated with the existence of particular mutations. Twelve MEFV (Mediterranean fever) gene mutations were investigated in 119 patients suffering from FMF. Heterozygote M694V (21/119), heterozygote E148Q (21/119), homozygote M694V (17/119) and heterozygote V726A (12/119) mutations were the most common mutations. Patients were grouped according to the presence of the M694V mutation: group I was M694V/M694V, group II was M694V/others, and group III was other/other. Mean severity scores for the groups were 13.94 +/- 4.10, 10.79 +/- 3.01 and 8.31 +/- 2.26, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the mean severity scores of groups I and II (p = 0.029), groups I and III (p &lt; 0.0001), and groups II and III (p &lt; 0.0001). Diagnosis of amyloidosis was established in four (23%) patients of group I, and three (8%) patients of group II, but in none of the patients in group III. There was also a statistically significant difference between groups I and III (p = 0.046), but not between groups II and III (p = 0.083) and groups I and II (p = 0.317) in terms of amyloidosis development. In conclusion, we found a higher disease severity score and higher prevalence of amyloidosis in FMF patients who were M694V mutation carriers. Many ethnic groups live in Anatolia and more ethnic origin-based studies are needed to determine the real effect of these mutations on disease severity and amyloidosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>862</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Detection of novel germ-line p53 mutations in diverse-cancer-prone families identified by selecting patients with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>150</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Germ-line p53 mutations appear to be inherited among the members of families diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). The mutations detected in those families to date have been clustered in exon 7 of the p53 gene and, typically, have been single-base substitutions resulting in amino acid changes. PURPOSE: Our aim was to define the spectrum of p53 mutations associated with LFS. METHODS: From seven cancer-prone families identified by selecting members with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma as probands, we chose two families, each of which had two members from whom specimens could be obtained for genetic analysis. To detect germ-line p53 gene mutations in these individuals, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis with Taq polymerase and oligonucleotide primers specific for p53 gene sequences. Genomic DNA extracted from fresh tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tumor samples was amplified, denatured, and electrophoresed on neutral polyacrylamide gels. PCR amplification was also carried out using total RNA from adrenocortical carcinoma samples of the proband in family 1. PCR products were purified, subcloned, and sequenced. RESULTS: We detected novel germ-line p53 mutations in affected members of both cancer-prone families. In the proband of family 1, a single-base deletion was detected at the first nucleotide of codon 307 in exon 8 of the p53 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 10. In family 2, we detected an A to C transversion at the second nucleotide of codon 286 in exon 8, both in DNA isolated from the adrenocortical tumor of the proband and in DNA isolated from the astrocytoma of the proband's father. This single-base substitution resulted in an amino acid substitution of alanine for glutamic acid. Both of these mutations are located outside the highly conserved region of the p53 gene where mutations in patients with LFS have been reported previously. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a wide range of germ-line p53 mutations is inherited in members of diverse-cancer-prone families.</text></passage></document><document><id>863</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial hypercholesterolemia in St-Petersburg: the known and novel mutations found in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene in Russia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>140</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia is a human monogenic disease caused by population-specific mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. Despite thirteen different mutations of the LDL receptor gene were reported from Russia prior to 2003, the whole spectrum of disease-causing gene alterations in this country is poorly known and requires further investigation provided by the current study. METHODS: Forty-five patients with clinical diagnosis of FH were tested for the apolipoprotein B (apoB) mutation R3500Q by restriction fragment length analysis. After exclusion of R3500Q mutation high-sensitive fluorescent single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and automatic DNA sequencing were used to search for mutations in the LDL receptor gene. RESULTS: We found twenty one rare sequence variations of the LDL receptor gene. Nineteen were probably pathogenic mutations, and two (P518P, T705I) were considered as neutral ones. Among the mutations likely to be pathogenic, eight were novel (c.670-671insG, C249X, c.936-940del5, c.1291-1331del41, W422X, c.1855-1856insA, D601N, C646S), and eleven (Q12X, IVS3+1G>A, c.651-653del3, E207X, c.925-931del7, C308Y, L380H, c.1302delG, IVS9+1G>A, V776M, V806I) have already been described in other populations. None of the patients had the R3500Q mutation in the apoB gene. CONCLUSIONS: Nineteen pathogenic mutations in the LDL receptor gene in 23 probands were identified. Two mutations c.925-931del7 and L380H are shared by St.-Petersburg population with neighbouring Finland and several other mutations with Norway, Sweden or Denmark, i.e. countries from the Baltic Sea region. Only four mutations (c.313+1G>A, c.651-653del3, C308Y and W422X) were recurrent as all those were found in two unrelated families. By this study the number of known mutations in the LDL receptor gene in St.-Petersburg area was increased nearly threefold. Analysis of all 34 low density lipoprotein receptor gene mutations found in St.-Petersburg argues against strong founder effect in Russian familial hypercholesterolemia.</text></passage></document><document><id>864</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Expanded CTG repeats within the DMPK 3' UTR causes severe skeletal muscle wasting in an inducible mouse model for myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>Severe skeletal muscle wasting is the most debilitating symptom experienced by individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). We present a DM1 mouse model with inducible and skeletal muscle-specific expression of large tracts of CTG repeats in the context of DMPK exon 15. These mice recapitulate many findings associated with DM1 skeletal muscle, such as CUG RNA foci with Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) protein colocalization, misregulation of developmentally regulated alternative splicing events, myotonia, characteristic histological abnormalities, and increased CUGBP1 protein levels. Importantly, this DM1 mouse model recapitulates severe muscle wasting, which has not been reported in models in which depletion of MBNL1 is the main feature. Using these mice, we discovered previously undescribed alternative splicing events that are responsive to CUGBP1 and not MBNL, and these events were found to be misregulated in individuals with DM1. Our results indicate that increased CUGBP1 protein levels are associated with DMPK-CUG RNA expression, suggesting a role for CUGBP1-specific splicing or cytoplasmic functions in muscle wasting.</text></passage></document><document><id>865</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Risk reversals in predictive testing for Huntington disease. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset><text>The first predictive testing for Huntington disease ( HD ) was based on analysis of linked polymorphic DNA markers to estimate the likelihood of inheriting the mutation for HD .

The GLB1 gene gives rise to the GLB1 lysosomal enzyme and to the elastin binding protein (EBP), involved in elastic fiber deposition. GLB1 forms a complex with protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA), alpha neuraminidase (NEU1), and galactosamine 6-sulphate sulfatase (GALNS) inside lysosomes, while EBP binds to PPCA and NEU1 on the cell surface. We investigated the function of the GLB1 and EBP mutated proteins by analyzing the clinical, genetic, and cellular data of 11 G(M1)-gangliosidosis patients. Their molecular analysis, followed by expression studies, lead to the identification of four new and 10 known GLB1 mutations. Some common amino acid substitutions [c.1445G>A (p.Arg482H), c.622C>T (p.Arg208His), c.175C>T (p.Arg59Cys) and c.176G>A (p.Arg59His)] were present in the GLB1 enzyme of several patients, all of Mediterranean origin, suggesting a common origin. Western blotting analyses against GLB1, EBP, and PPCA proteins showed that the identified mutations affect GLB1 enzyme activity and/or stability. The c.1445G>A (p.Arg482His), c.175C>T (p.Arg59Cys), c.733+2T>C, c.1736G>A (p.Gly579Asp), and c.1051C>T (p.Arg351X) GLB1 mutations, affect the stabilization of PPCA probably because they hamper the interaction between GLB1/EBP and PPCA within the multiprotein complex. The amount of EBP was normal, but the detection of impaired elastogenesis in such patients suggests an alteration in its function. We conclude that the presence of genetic lesions in both GLB1 and EBP coding region does not directly predict impaired elastogenesis and that elastic fiber assembly has to be evaluated specifically in each case. Nevertheless, the degree of EBP involvement may be linked to specific clinical findings.</text></passage></document><document><id>867</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prognostic significance of DCC and p27Kip1 in colorectal cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>The progression of colorectal cancer is a multistage process associated with specific molecular alterations.

In this study, the immunohistochemical expression of the deleted in colorectal cancer gene (DCC) and p27Kip1 was assessed in 168 paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tumors of patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank statistics were used to analyze survival times after curative primary tumor resection, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust the assessment of demographic and clinical covariates. Loss of DCC or p27Kip1 expression had no influence on survival in patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer. The 5-year survival rates of DCC-positive and DCC-negative tumors were 51.8% and 35.7% (P=0.40), respectively. The 5-year survival rate of patients with p27Kip1-positive tumors was 47.9%, whereas the rate for patients with p27Kip1-negative tumors was 38.8% (P=0.68).

Hereditary CRC is conventionally divided into two major categories: hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and those related to polyposis syndromes including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Peutz-Jegher syndrome (PJS), and juvenile polyposis (JP). The screening for the cancer and methods of treatment applied to patients with hereditary CRC are quite different from those applied to the general population. The genes responsible for these syndromes has recently identified, as a result, genetic testing has become the most important determining factor in clinical decisions. Germ-line mutation of the APC gene induces FAP, an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of colonic adenomas. CRC appears in almost all affected individuals by the time they are 50 years of age. An affected individual should undergo colectomy by his/her late teens. Furthermore, according to the findings of genetic testing, at-risk family members also need endoscopic surveillance and surgery. Recently, a mutation on the MYH gene is increasingly being investigated in patients with multiple polyps, and autosomal recessive MYH polyposis is considered to be a new category of polyposis. More common than FAP, HNPCC is caused by germ-line mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, mainly MLH1 and MSH2. Although there is no polyposis, polyps seem to be more villous and dysplastic and appear to grow rapidly into CRCs. The aggregate lifetime risk of CRC is about 80% for mutation carriers. The risk for other types of cancer, such as endometrial, ovarian, small bowel, and transitional cell cancer, is also increased. The Amsterdam criteria and Bethesda guidelines are the best-known tools for diagnosis and genetic testing, and colectomy followed by endoscopic follow-up is the standard treatment. PJS and JP are reported to be characterized by hamartomatous polyps throughout the GI tract and germ-line mutations in the STK11 gene (PJS) and the DPC4/BMPR1A gene (JP).</text></passage></document><document><id>870</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Chromosomal assignments of 17 structural genes and 11 related DNA fragments in rats (Rattus norvegicus) by Southern blot analysis of rat x mouse somatic cell hybrid clones.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>173</offset><text>DNA from 18 rat x mouse somatic cell hybrid clones, which segregated individual rat chromosomes, was analyzed by Southern blot for chromosomal gene assignments.

BAF180 can be mutated and has tumor suppressing properties in breast cancer. In addition, another member of this complex, hSNF5/INI1, is a known tumor suppressor gene (TSG) for malignant rhabdoid and childhood central nervous system tumors. Thus, BAF180 is a strong candidate TSG for lung cancer. The objective of this study was to determine whether BAF180 mRNA or protein expression was inactivated or abnormal in lung cancers to prompt detailed DNA promoter methylation or mutational analyses. In 30 non-small-cell and 26 small-cell lung cancer cell lines, most of which had 3p21 allele loss, BAF180 mRNA and protein expression were evaluated by RT-PCR using three sets of primers and Western blotting using two anti-BAF180 antibodies. In all cases, BAF180 was expressed and no abnormal size BAF180 protein was detected. Finally, we found no amino-acid sequence coding mutations in five non-small-cell and five small-cell lung cancer cell lines, while we did find a new splicing isoform of BAF180 (AY281068). We conclude that abnormalities of BAF180 are not frequently involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>873</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of KIT, SCF, and initial screening of SLUG in patients with piebaldism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset></passage></document><document><id>874</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Diagnosis of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies by polymerase chain reaction.

DESIGN--DNA from the patients was screened for deletion mutations using multiplex PCR, and the results were compared with those obtained by Southern blot analysis. The PCR multiplex reaction detects nine specific "hot-spot" exons in the dystrophin gene while the Southern analysis detects 66 specific dystrophin gene restriction fragments. The multiplex reaction requires 50-fold less DNA than Southern analysis and thus is considerably more sensitive. SETTING--Fourteen university-affiliated and private genetic disease diagnostic laboratories. PATIENTS--Male patients with clinical signs of DMD/BMD. Cases were selected for analysis randomly, without knowledge of whether a deletion was present within the dystrophin gene. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The percentage of cases that were detectable by multiplex PCR in comparison with Southern analysis, the frequency, extent, and location of the detected deletion mutations. In some cases, duplication mutations were monitored. RESULTS--The accuracy of a single PCR multiplex amplification (nine exons) was compared with Southern analysis with 10 cDNA probes that cover the full length of the gene. The multiplex PCR analytic method detected 82% of those deletions detected by Southern analysis methods. In one of 745 analyses, the multiplex method suggested a single exon deletion, which was not confirmed by Southern analysis, representing a false-positive rate of 0.013%. CONCLUSIONS--Multiplex PCR represents a sensitive and accurate method for deletion detection of 46% of all cases of DMD/BMD. The method requires 1 day for analysis, is easy to perform, and does not use radioactive tracers. As such, multiplex PCR represents an efficient and rapid method for prenatal or postnatal diagnosis of DMD/BMD.</text></passage></document><document><id>875</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Disease-associated mutations cause premature oligomerization of myelin proteolipid protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a dysmyelinating disease caused by mutations, deletions, or duplications of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene. Mutant forms of PLP are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the resulting accumulation of mutant protein is thought to be a direct cause of oligodendrocyte cell death, which is the primary clinical feature of PMD. The molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of mutant PLP are however currently unknown. We report here that PMD-linked mutations of PLP are associated with the accelerated assembly of the protein into stable homooligomers that resemble mature, native PLP. Thus although WT PLP forms stable oligomers after an extended maturation period, most likely at the cell surface, mutant forms of PLP rapidly assemble into such oligomers at the ER. Using PLP mutants associated with diseases of varying severity, we show that the formation of stable oligomers correlates with the development of PMD. Based on these findings, we propose that the premature oligomerization of PLP in the ER of oligodendrocytes contributes to the pathology of PMD.</text></passage></document><document><id>876</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>HDAC inhibitors correct frataxin deficiency in a Friedreich ataxia mouse model.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative and cardiac disease, is caused by abnormally low levels of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein. All Friedreich ataxia patients carry a GAATTC repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene, either in the homozygous state or in compound heterozygosity with other loss-of-function mutations. The GAA expansion inhibits frataxin expression through a heterochromatin-mediated repression mechanism. Histone modifications that are characteristic of silenced genes in heterochromatic regions occur at expanded alleles in cells from Friedreich ataxia patients, including increased trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and hypoacetylation of histones H3 and H4. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we detected the same heterochromatin marks in homozygous mice carrying a (GAA)(230) repeat in the first intron of the mouse frataxin gene (KIKI mice). These animals have decreased frataxin levels and, by microarray analysis, show significant gene expression changes in several tissues. We treated KIKI mice with a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, compound 106, which substantially increases frataxin mRNA levels in cells from Friedreich ataxia individuals. Treatment increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in chromatin near the GAA repeat and restored wild-type frataxin levels in the nervous system and heart, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and semiquantitative western blot analysis. No toxicity was observed. Furthermore, most of the differentially expressed genes in KIKI mice reverted towards wild-type levels. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Lack of acute toxicity, normalization of frataxin levels and of the transcription profile changes resulting from frataxin deficiency provide strong support to a possible efficacy of this or related compounds in reverting the pathological process in Friedreich ataxia, a so far incurable neurodegenerative disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>877</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids does not affect mitochondrial function in adrenoleukodystrophy protein deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD, OMIM 300100) is a severe inherited neurodegenerative disease, associated with the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). The recent unexpected observation that the accumulation of VLCFA in tissues of the Abcd1-deficient mouse model for X-ALD is not due to a deficiency in VLCFA degradation, led to the hypothesis that mitochondrial abnormalities might contribute to X-ALD pathology. Here, we report that in spite of substantial accumulation of VLCFA in whole muscle homogenates, normal VLCFA levels were detected in mitochondria obtained by organellar fractionation. Polarographic analyses of the respiratory chain as well as enzymatic assays of isolated muscle mitochondria revealed no differences between X-ALD and control mice. Moreover, analysis by electron microscopy, revealed normal size, structure and localization of mitochondria in muscle of both groups. Similar to the results obtained in skeletal muscle, the mitochondrial enzyme activities in brain homogenates of Abcd1-deficient and wild-type animals also did not differ. Finally, studies on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in permeabilized human skin fibroblasts of X-ALD patients and controls revealed no abnormalities. Thus, we conclude that the accumulation of VLCFA per se does not cause mitochondrial abnormalities and vice versa-mitochondrial abnormalities are not responsible for the accumulation of VLCFA in X-ALD mice.</text></passage></document><document><id>878</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Molecular pathways to myotonic dystrophy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy(DM), the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, comprises at least 2 sub-types, DM1 and DM2. DM1 is caused by the expansion of a CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region (3UTR) of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Recently, the expansion of a CCTG tetranucleotide repeat located in the first intron of the ZNF9 gene was identified as the mutation responsible for DM2. Since both DM1 and DM2 are caused by the expansion of repetitive sequences, some common factors that interact with these sequences might be involved in the pathogenesis of DM.

We have reconstructed the genealogies of 15 obligate carriers of the FCD allele to an average depth of 12 generations identifying 60 ancestors and 80 European founders common to all of them. The ancestral origins of the European founders show a significantly greater number of individuals born in the French provinces of Normandy and Perche than expected based on information regarding the origins of the 8,500 immigrants who settled the colony of New France during the French regime. We have identified common ancestors among the 10 who were born in Quebec who appear to be likely candidates for the origin of the FCD mutation. One such couple had 11 children, 5 of whom settled in regions of Quebec or New Brunswick that today have elevated heterozygote frequencies for the FCD. The five offspring are ancestors of all known carriers. By contrast, the absence of FCD alleles among TSD probands in France suggests that the mutation did not occur in a European founder.</text></passage></document><document><id>880</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Acute colchicine intoxication--possible role of erythromycin administration.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>A 29-year-old patient with familial Mediterranean fever and amyloidosis involving the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract received longterm colchicine, 1 mg daily.

Inactive ATM dimers were activated in vitro with DNA in the presence of MRN, leading to phosphorylation of the downstream cellular targets p53 and Chk2. ATM autophosphorylation was not required for monomerization of ATM by MRN. The unwinding of DNA ends by MRN was essential for ATM stimulation, which is consistent with the central role of single-stranded DNA as an evolutionarily conserved signal for DNA damage.</text></passage></document><document><id>882</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PLP1 splicing abnormalities identified in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and SPG2 fibroblasts are associated with different types of mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>142</offset><text>The proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene encodes the two major proteins of the central nervous system (CNS) myelin: PLP and DM20. PLP1 gene mutations are associated with a large spectrum of X-linked dysmyelinating disorders ranging from hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), to spastic paraplegia (SPG2) according to the nature of the mutation. Genetic heterogeneity exists and mutations in the gap-junction alpha 12 (GJA12) gene have been related to PMD. About 20% of patients with the PMD phenotype remain without mutation in these two genes and are classified as affected by Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD). To study PLP1 splicing abnormalities, we analyzed PLP/DM20 transcripts from nerves and/or skin cultured fibroblasts of 14 PMD/SPG2 patients carrying different PLP1 mutations and 20 PMLD patients. We found that various types of PLP1 mutations result in missplicing, including one considered as a missense in exon 2 and a nucleotide substitution in intron 3 outside the classical donor and acceptor splicing sites. Moreover, we demonstrated for two patients that the fibroblast transcript pattern was in accordance with the one observed in the corresponding CNS/peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissues. Finally, we observed no abnormal splicing in fibroblasts of 20 PMLD patients tested; suggesting that PLP1 gene splicing abnormalities, potentially caused by undetected intronic mutations, are either not involved or are very rarely implicated in the PMLD phenotype. These results confirm that fibroblasts are reliable, accessible cells useful in detecting PLP1 transcript abnormalities, better characterizing the functional consequences of PLP1 mutations for genotype-phenotype correlation, characterizing new PLP1 splicing regulatory elements, and identifying PLP1 mutations undetected by conventional PLP1 screening.</text></passage></document><document><id>883</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Differential glucocorticoid effects on the fusion of Duchenne/Becker and control muscle cultures: pharmacologic detection of accelerated aging in dystrophic muscle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>165</offset><text>We report that the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (Mepd) enhanced myogenesis in normal primary human muscle cultures, but inhibited myogenesis of most Duchenne/Becker muscle cultures.

A case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy from an exceptionally young patient yielded a muscle culture that was myogenically stimulated by Mepd. These results suggest that continuous cycles of degeneration and regeneration of dystrophic muscle in vivo may result in a change of the glucocorticoid response of the muscle progenitor cells.

The blood-clotting indices of the proposita and her father were prolonged, and their functional and immunologic fibrinogen was absent. To identify the mutations of fibrinogen genes in this family, all the exons and exon-intron boundaries of the three fibrinogen genes (FGA, FGB, FGG) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products was performed, then the restriction endonuclease (RsaI) analysis was used to confirm the mutation. A homozygous C --> T mutation was found at nucleotide 3108 in exon 4 of the FGA gene of the proposita and her father; it is a null mutation predicting to produce severely truncated A alpha-chains because of the presence of premature termination at the Gln 150 codon (or truncated at the 131 residues according to the mature A alpha-chain). Her mother and some other family members were heterozygous.

In order to refine this finding we typed 42 additional microsatellite markers on chromosome 6q between D6S1570 (99.01 cM from the pter) and D6S281 (190.14 from the pter) in the same sample (average intermarker distance approximately 1.7 cM). In the 23 cM region between D6S1715 and D6S311, markers were more closely spaced ( approximately 1.1 cM). Multipoint nonparametric and parametric and single point linkage analyses were performed. The peak NPL rose to 4.98 (P=0.00000058) at D6S1626 (136.97 cM), immediately adjacent to D6S292 (NPL 4.98, P=0.00000068), the marker that gave the highest NPL in the original genome scan, under the broad diagnostic category. The putative susceptibility region (NPL-1) was reduced from 12.0 to 4.96 cM. The peak multipoint parametric LOD score was 4.63 at D6S1626 under a dominant genetic model, core diagnostic category and the LOD-1 interval was 2.10 cM. The maximum single point LOD score (3.55, theta=0.01) was also at D6S1626 (dominant model, core diagnostic category). Increased evidence for linkage in the same sample as in the original genome scan and consistent localization of the linkage peak add further support for the presence of a schizophrenia susceptibility locus at chromosome 6q23. Moreover, the markedly reduced linkage interval greatly improves prospects for identifying a schizophrenia susceptibility gene within the implicated region.</text></passage></document><document><id>888</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Requirement for microtubules and dynein motors in the earliest stages of peroxisome biogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>Our aim was to determine the role of microtubules in the biogenesis of peroxisomes. Fusion experiments between human PEX16- and PEX1-mutant cells in the presence of nocodazol implied that microtubules were not required for import of proteins into the peroxisomal matrix after cell fusion complementation. We further studied the importance of microtubules in the early stages of peroxisome biogenesis following the microinjection complementation of PEX16-mutant cells. In the absence of nocodazol, nuclear microinjection of plasmids expressing EGFP-SKL and Pex16p in PEX16-mutant cells resulted in the accumulation of EGFP-SKL into newly formed peroxisomes. However, pretreatment of the cells with nocodazol, prior to microinjection, resulted in the inhibition of complementation of the PEX16 mutant and the cytosolic location of the EGFP-SKL. In addition, coexpression of a dominant-negative CC1 subunit of the dynein/dynactin motor complex resulted in the inability to complement PEX16-mutant cells. Both of these treatments resulted in the cytosolic localization of expressed Pex16p. Our results demonstrate that the formation of peroxisomes via the preperoxisomal compartment is dependent upon microtubules and minus-end-directed motor proteins and that the inhibition described above occurs at a step that precedes the association of Pex16p with the vesicles that would otherwise become the peroxisomes.</text></passage></document><document><id>889</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Localization of the pig gene ESD to chromosome 13 by in situ hybridization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset></passage></document><document><id>890</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The retinoblastoma gene in breast cancer: allele loss is not correlated with loss of gene protein expression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset><text>The significance of the retinoblastoma gene (RB) in the development of human breast cancer remains unclear.

However, allele loss was not associated with loss of RB protein (pRB) expression. Low to absent levels of pRB were found in 15% of 73 immunoblot analyzed tumors, most of which manifested retained heterozygosity in RB. Conversely, tumors exhibiting LOH showed often high pRB expression. Our data suggest that RB may be involved in the pathogenesis of some breast tumors, as evidenced by the absence of pRB, but that this alteration is acquired by mechanisms other than the unmasking of a recessive mutation by allele loss. LOH in RB may be merely a stochastic event in the unstable genome of aneuploid, rapidly proliferating cells or, alternatively, reflect the presence of an adjacent tumor suppressor gene.</text></passage></document><document><id>891</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of the mutations causing hemophilia B in 2 domestic cats.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>The purpose of the present study was to determine the normal sequence for the gene encoding factor IX in cats and to characterize the genetic basis for hemophilia B in 2 unrelated male, domestic, mixed-breed cats. Genomic DNA sequence for the entire coding region of the factor IX gene was determined in the affected cats and compared to the sequence obtained from a healthy cat. The factor IX gene in cats encodes a mature protein consisting of 420 amino acids, unlike genes in humans and dogs that encode 415 and 413 amino acid proteins, respectively. Affected cat 1 had a single nucleotide change in exon 8 at the 1st nucleotide position of the codon encoding an arginine (CGA to TGA) at amino acid position 338. This mutation would be predicted to result in the appearance of a premature stop codon in the portion of the gene encoding much of the catalytic domain of the protein. Affected cat 2 had a single nucleotide change in exon 4 at the 2nd nucleotide position of the codon encoding amino acid 82 (TGT to TAT), which would be predicted to result in the substitution of a tyrosine for a cysteine. This substitution would likely result in disruption of a disulfide bond crucial to normal protein structure and function. This study represents the 1st time hemophilia B has been characterized at the molecular level in cats.</text></passage></document><document><id>892</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Restless legs syndrome: confirmation of linkage to chromosome 12q, genetic heterogeneity, and evidence of complexity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Genes are involved in the etiology of restless legs syndrome, a common sensorimotor disorder. OBJECTIVES: To replicate and to further characterize our previously reported chromosome 12q linkage results. DESIGN: Family linkage study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 276 individuals from 19 families have been examined using a selection of markers spanning the identified candidate interval on chromosome 12q. RESULTS: Two-point analyses of individual pedigrees indicated that 5 kindreds were consistent with linkage to chromosome 12q. When considering these 5 pedigrees along with the family in which linkage was originally reported, we observed a maximum 2-point logarithm-of-odds score of 5.67 (at theta = 0.10; for marker D12S1636; autosomal recessive) and a maximum multipoint logarithm-of-odds score of 8.84 between the interval defined by markers D12S326 and D12S304. Furthermore, our results also suggest the presence of heterogeneity in restless legs syndrome as linkage was formally excluded across the region in 6 pedigrees. Interestingly, significantly higher periodic leg movements during sleep indices were observed for all probands with restless legs syndrome from linked families. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the presence of a major restless legs syndrome-susceptibility locus on chromosome 12q, which has been designated as RLS1, and also suggest that at least one additional locus may be involved in the origin of this prevalent condition.</text></passage></document><document><id>893</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cardiac dysrhythmias,cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy in patients with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>154</offset><text>Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B) are characterized by cardiac dysrhythmias, late-onset cardiomyopathy, slowly progressive skeletal myopathy and contractures of the neck, elbows and ankles. The causative mutation is either in the emerin gene (X-linked recessive EDMD) or lamin A/C gene (autosomal dominant EDMD2 or LGMD1B). We report three cases of EDMD, EDMD2 and LGMD1B. A 14-yr-old boy showed limitation of cervical flexion and contractures of both elbows and ankles. Sinus arrest with junctional escape beats was noted. He was diagnosed as X-linked recessive EDMD (MIM 310300). A 28-yr-old female showed severe wasting and weakness of humeroperoneal muscles. Marked limitation of cervical flexion and contractures of both elbows and ankles were noted. Varying degrees of AV block were noted. She was diagnosed as autosomal dominant EDMD2 (MIM 181350). A 41-yr-old female had contractures of both ankles and limb-girdle type muscular dystrophy. ECG revealed atrial tachycardia with high grade AV block. She was diagnosed as autosomal dominant LGMD1B (MIM 159001). Cardiac dysrhythmias in EDMD and LGMD1B include AV block, bradycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial standstill, causing sudden death necessitating pacemaker implantation. Cardiologists should know about these unusual genetic diseases with conduction defects, especially in young adults.</text></passage></document><document><id>894</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Huntington's disease like-2: review and update.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>48</offset><text>Huntington's Disease-like 2 (HDL2), like Huntington's disease (HD), is an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disorder clinically characterized by abnormal movements, dementia, and psychiatric syndromes. Like HD, the neuropathology of HDL2 features prominent cortical and striatal atrophy and intranuclear inclusions. HDL2 is generally rare, accounting for only a few percent of HD-like cases in which the HD mutation has already been excluded. However, the rate is considerably higher among individuals of African ancestry, and is almost as common as HD in Black South Africans. The disorder is caused by a CTG/CAG expansion mutation on chromosome 16q24.3, with normal and expanded repeat ranges similar to HD, and a correlation between repeat length and onset age very similar to HD. Surprisingly, the available evidence suggests that HDL2 is not a polyglutamine disease. Rather, the repeat expansion is located within Junctophilin-3 in the CTG orientation. The phenotypic similarities between HD and HDL2 suggest that understanding the pathobiology of HDL2 may shed new light on the pathogenesis of HD and other disorders of striatal neurodegeneration.</text></passage></document><document><id>895</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation analysis of UBE3A in Angelman syndrome patients. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>58</offset><text>Angelman syndrome ( AS ) is caused by chromosome 15q11-q13 deletions of maternal origin , by paternal uniparental disomy ( UPD ) 15 , by imprinting defects , and by mutations in the UBE3A gene .

This is particularly true for diseases caused by alterations of proteins for which no three-dimensional structure is available. One such disease is Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, a disorder arising from a lack of activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA, EC 3.2.1.76). This deficiency compromises the degradation pathway of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, leading to substrate accumulation, which ultimately results in a multisystem disorder. Patients with IDUA deficiency have a wide spectrum of disease ranging from an early onset, rapidly progressive form leading to death in the first decade of life, to an attenuated disease which manifests in adolescence and leads to progressive joint and cardiac disease but is associated with a normal life span. Many patients fit into a disease phenotype intermediate to these extremes. While a number of point mutations have been described as leading to varying degrees of disease severity, a structural basis for these genotype-phenotype correlations has not been available owing to the lack of a three-dimensional structure for IDUA. A homology model for the IDUA enzyme was constructed based on the recently solved crystal structure of the beta-xylosidase from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (XyTS, EC 3.2.1.37), both of which belong to the same sequence-related family (CAZY family 39). This model provides insights into why certain point mutations produce severely misfolded proteins and thus lead to severe disease, and why other mutations produce proteins with only minor structural perturbations and therefore the attenuated form of the disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>898</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic bases of human complement C7 deficiency. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>49</offset><text>Complement C7 deficiency ( C7D ) is associated frequently with recurrent bacterial infections , especially meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis .

METHODS: The scientific literature regarding the glaucoma associated with OCRL from 1952, when the first report of the syndrome appeared, to the present was reviewed. The medical records of 7 patients with OCRL were studied. The occurrence of glaucoma, corneal changes secondary to glaucoma, gonioscopic abnormalities, iris features, and response to glaucoma surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Signs of glaucoma are defining abnormalities leading to recognition of OCRL. The OCRL medical literature reports the frequency of glaucoma, secondary clinical signs of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and results of glaucoma surgery, but little information related to the responsible filtration angle abnormalities. Glaucoma was present in 71% (5 of 7) of patients studied, and was recognized in infancy in 9 of their 10 eyes. Gonioscopy was performed in 6 OCRL patients and revealed the constant presence of open angles, primary filtration angle anomalies, and defects considered secondary to previous infantile lens extractions. The observed anomalies were anterior insertion of the iris, narrowing of the ciliary body band, and decreased visibility of the scleral spur. The angle defects felt to be acquired following lens surgery included a more anterior insertion of the iris on to the trabecular meshwork, pigment dusting of the angle tissues, and iris synechial abnormalities related to the surgery. Bilateral goniotomies were unsuccessful in 4 of 4 patients. The fundi of 6 of 7 patients showed normal optic disc development with variable abnormalities secondary to glaucoma, and normal retinal vessels. Minimal evidence of macular development was observed in a single patient from 1 month of age to his most recent examination at 14 months of age. CONCLUSION: A primary X-linked infantile glaucoma is a defining and frequent component of OCRL and is secondary to expression of a primary filtration angle anomaly. Goniotomy was unsuccessful in all (8) operated eyes. The adverse effects of cataract surgery on the filtration angle structures may influence the results of goniotomy surgery by superimposing a secondary aphakic glaucoma component that may explain the need for alternative glaucoma surgery.</text></passage></document><document><id>900</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular breakpoint cloning and gene expression studies of a novel translocation t(4;15)(q27;q11.2) associated with Prader-Willi syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>140</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (MIM #176270; PWS) is caused by lack of the paternally-derived copies, or their expression, of multiple genes in a 4 Mb region on chromosome 15q11.2. Known mechanisms include large deletions, maternal uniparental disomy or mutations involving the imprinting center. De novo balanced reciprocal translocations in 5 reported individuals had breakpoints clustering in SNRPN intron 2 or exon 20/intron 20. To further dissect the PWS phenotype and define the minimal critical region for PWS features, we have studied a 22 year old male with a milder PWS phenotype and a de novo translocation t(4;15)(q27;q11.2). METHODS: We used metaphase FISH to narrow the breakpoint region and molecular analyses to map the breakpoints on both chromosomes at the nucleotide level. The expression of genes on chromosome 15 on both sides of the breakpoint was determined by RT-PCR analyses. RESULTS: Pertinent clinical features include neonatal hypotonia with feeding difficulties, hypogonadism, short stature, late-onset obesity, learning difficulties, abnormal social behavior and marked tolerance to pain, as well as sticky saliva and narcolepsy. Relative macrocephaly and facial features are not typical for PWS. The translocation breakpoints were identified within SNRPN intron 17 and intron 10 of a spliced non-coding transcript in band 4q27. LINE and SINE sequences at the exchange points may have contributed to the translocation event. By RT-PCR of lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, we find that upstream SNURF/SNRPN exons and snoRNAs HBII-437 and HBII-13 are expressed, but the downstream snoRNAs PWCR1/HBII-85 and HBII-438A/B snoRNAs are not. CONCLUSION: As part of the PWCR1/HBII-85 snoRNA cluster is highly conserved between human and mice, while no copy of HBII-438 has been found in mouse, we conclude that PWCR1/HBII-85 snoRNAs is likely to play a major role in the PWS- phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>901</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Transferrin receptor co-localizes and interacts with the hemochromatosis factor (HFE) and the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) in trophoblast cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>152</offset><text>Iron uptake and storage are tightly regulated to guarantee sufficient iron for essential cellular processes and to prevent the production of damaging free radicals. The placenta is the entry site for iron, which is delivered to the developing embryo. Iron is taken up by syncytiotrophoblast cells and is transported unidirectionally from mother to fetus against a concentration gradient. Several iron transporters and regulators were recently characterized, including DMT1 and ferroportin/Ireg1 that transport iron through membranes, and HFE that regulates TfR-mediated iron uptake. In this study we demonstrate that in a differentiated choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo, HFE, and TfR are localized mainly in recycling endosomes and a small percentage of these complexes is observed in late endosomes with DMT1 while in trophoblast cells, the level of TfR is significantly lower and it is detected with HFE and DMT1 mainly in late endosomes. Most interestingly, TfR and HFE, as well as TfR and DMT1 interact in placental trophoblast cells. Based on previous and these data we suggest that the level of intracellular iron may regulate both TfR expression (on the post-transcriptional and the post-translational levels) and TfR trafficking/transcytosis in polarized cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>902</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular and genealogical characterization of the R1443X BRCA1 mutation in high-risk French-Canadian breast/ovarian cancer families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>The Quebec population contains about six-million French Canadians, descended from the French settlers who colonized "Nouvelle-France" between 1608 and 1765. Although the relative genetic contribution of each of these founders is highly variable, altogether they account for the major part of the contemporary French-Canadian gene pool. This study was designed to analyze the role of this founder effect in the introduction and diffusion of the BRCA1 recurrent R1443X mutant allele. A highly conserved haplotype, observed in 18 French-Canadian families and generated using 17 microsatellite markers surrounding the BRCA1 locus, supports the fact that the R1443X mutation is a founder mutation in the Quebec population. We also performed haplotyping analysis of R1443X carriers on 19 other families from seven different nationalities; although the same alleles are shared for three markers surrounding the BRCA1 gene, distinct haplotypes were obtained in four families, suggesting multiple origins for the R1443X mutation. Ascending genealogies of the 18 French Canadian families and of controls were reconstructed on an average depth of 10 generations. We identified the founder couple with the highest probability of having introduced the mutation in the population. Based on the descending genealogy of this couple, we detected the presence of geographical concentration in the diffusion pattern of the mutation. This study demonstrates how molecular genetics and demogenetic analyses can complement each other to provide findings that could have an impact on public health. Moreover, this approach is certainly not unique to breast cancer genetics and could be used to understand other complex traits.</text></passage></document><document><id>903</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The RNA-binding protein CUGBP1 regulates stability of tumor necrosis factor mRNA in muscle cells: implications for myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>135</offset><text>Type I myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the dystrophia myotonia protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Pathogenesis is closely linked with production of a toxic RNA from the mutant allele, which interferes with function of several RNA-binding proteins, including CUGBP1. Here we show that expression of a mutant DMPK 3'-UTR containing 960 CUG repeats is sufficient to increase expression and stability of an mRNA encoding the potent proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF). CUGBP1 specifically recognizes sequences within the TNF 3'-UTR that are dissimilar from its canonical UG-rich binding site. Depletion of CUGBP1 from mouse myoblasts results in increased abundance of TNF mRNA through stabilization of the transcript. Moreover, activation of the protein kinase C pathway by treatment with phorbol ester, which has been shown previously to result in CUGBP1 phosphorylation, also causes TNF mRNA stabilization. Our results suggest that the elevated serum TNF seen in DM1 patients may be derived from muscle where it is induced by expression of toxic DMPK RNA. Importantly, overexpression of this potent cytokine could contribute to the muscle wasting and insulin resistance that are characteristic of this debilitating disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>904</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular bases of combined subtotal deficiencies of C6 and C7: their effects in combination with other C6 and C7 deficiencies. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>128</offset><text>Combined subtotal deficiency of C6 and C7 , in which both proteins are expressed at very low levels , has been observed in homozygous form in two families .

These disorders not only impair skeletal growth but also cause ocular and otolaryngological abnormalities. The classical phenotypes include the spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) spectrum with variable severity, Stickler dysplasia type I (STD-I), and Kniest dysplasia (KND). Most COL2A1 mutations occur in the triple helical region of alpha 1(II) chains: the SED spectrum is mostly attributed to missense mutations that substitute bulky amino acids for glycine residues, STD-I to haploinsufficiency of truncation mutations, and KND to exon skipping due to splice-site mutations. To further elucidate the genotype-phenotype relationship of type II collagenopathies, we examined COL2A1 mutations in 56 families that were suspected of having type II collagenopathies, and found 38 mutations in 41 families. Phenotypes for all 22 missense mutations and one in-frame deletion in the triple helical region fell along the SED spectrum. Glycine to serine substitutions resulted in alternating zones that produce severer and milder skeletal phenotypes. Glycine to nonserine residue substitutions exclusively created more severe phenotypes. The gradient of the SED spectrum did not necessarily correlate with the occurrence of extraskeletal manifestations. All nine truncation or splice-site mutations in the triple helical or N-propeptide region caused STD-I or KND, and extraskeletal changes were inevitable in both phenotypes. All six C-propeptide mutations produced a range of atypical skeletal phenotypes and created ocular, but not otolaryngological, changes.</text></passage></document><document><id>907</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>ANKH variants associated with ankylosing spondylitis: gender differences.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>The ank (progressive ankylosis) mutant mouse, which has a nonsense mutation in exon 12 of the inorganic pyrophosphate regulator gene (ank), exhibits aberrant joint ankylosis similar to human ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We previously performed family-based association analyses of 124 Caucasian AS families and showed that novel genetic markers in the 5' flanking region of ANKH (the human homolog of the murine ank gene) are modestly associated with AS. The objective of the present study was to conduct a more extensive evaluation of ANKH variants that are significantly associated with AS and to determine whether the association is gender specific. We genotyped 201 multiplex AS families with nine ANKH intragenetic and two flanking microsatellite markers, and performed family-based association analyses. We showed that ANKH variants located in two different regions of the ANKH gene were associated with AS. Results of haplotype analyses indicated that, after Bonferroni correction, the haplotype combination of rs26307 [C] and rs27356 [C] is significantly associated with AS in men (recessive/dominant model; P = 0.004), and the haplotype combination of rs28006 [C] and rs25957 [C] is significantly associated with AS in women (recessive/dominant model; P = 0.004). A test of interaction identified rs26307 (i.e. the region that was associated in men with AS) as showing a difference in the strength of the association by gender. The region associated with AS in women only showed significance in the test of interaction among the subset of families with affected individuals of both genders. These findings support the concept that ANKH plays a role in genetic susceptibility to AS and reveals a gender-genotype specificity in this interaction.</text></passage></document><document><id>908</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Screening for carrier and prenatal diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most common peroxisomal disorder characterized by progressive demyelination of the central nervous system, adrenal cortex insufficiency and accumulation of saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in tissues and body fluids due to the impaired beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. X-ALD shows a wide range of phenotypic variation. Childhood cerebral form (CCER) is the most common phenotype with severe neurological symptoms and often the average interval from onset to total disability or death is 3 years. So far no effective treatment is available for the underlying defect. Screening for carriers of mutated relevant gene and prenatal diagnosis are very important for the prevention of the disease. In this study, the authors explored the method of carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis of X-ALD. METHODS: The plasma VLCFAs levels of 83 suspected carriers for ALD were determined by using GC/MS and ABCD1 gene mutational analysis was performed in 31 of them. Amniocentesis was performed in 9 suspected carriers for ALD during 18 - 30 gestational weeks. The VLCFAs level of cultured amniocytes was tested with GC/MS. ABCD1 gene mutational analysis was performed on two cases (one was a male and the other a female) whose VLCFAs levels of amniocytes were found elevated. The plasma VLCFAs levels were measured in five of the nine prenatally diagnosed children when they were 1 day to 3.5 years old. RESULTS: Fifty-one of 83 suspected carriers had high plasma VLCFAs levels; 29 of 31 suspected carriers showed ABCD1 gene mutation. Among the nine fetuses, four were males and five were females. The VLCFAs levels of the cultured amniocytes were high in two cases, one was female and the other a male. ABCD1 gene mutational analysis of these two cases showed a 871G > A (E291K) mutation and a 726G > A (W242X) mutation, respectively, which confirmed the biochemical result. The VLCFAs levels were normal in the rest of cases and five of them were confirmed by postnatal plasma VLCFAs assay. CONCLUSION: The carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis are very important for prevention of the X-ALD. Only the combined use of plasma VLCFAs level analysis and ABCD1 gene mutational analysis could detect X-ALD carriers correctly. ABCD1 gene mutational analysis and postnatal plasma VLCFAs level test verified that amniocytes VLCFAs level analysis is a reliable prenatal diagnostic method for this disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>909</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Voluntary control of saccadic and smooth-pursuit eye movements in children with learning disorders.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Eye movement is crucial to humans in allowing them to aim the foveae at objects of interest. We examined the voluntary control of saccadic and smooth-pursuit eye movements in 18 subjects with learning disorders (LDs) (aged 8-16) and 22 normal controls (aged 7-15). The subjects were assigned visually guided, memory-guided, and anti-saccade tasks, and smooth-pursuit eye movements (SPEM). Although, the LD subjects showed normal results in the visually guided saccade task, they showed more errors in the memory-guided saccade task (e.g. they were unable to stop themselves reflexively looking at the cue) and longer latencies, even when they performed correctly. They also showed longer latencies than the controls in the anti-saccade task. These results suggest that they find it difficult to voluntarily suppress reflexive saccades and initiate voluntary saccades when a target is invisible. In SPEM using step-ramp stimuli, the LD subjects showed lower open- and closed-loop gains. These results suggest disturbances of both acceleration of eye movement in the initial state and maintenance of velocity in minimizing retinal slip in the steady state. Recent anatomical studies in LD subjects have suggested abnormalities in the structure of certain brain areas such as the frontal cortex. Frontal eye movement-related areas such as the frontal eye fields and supplementary eye fields may be involved in these disturbances of voluntary control of eye movement in LDs.</text></passage></document><document><id>910</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Alkaptonuric ochronosis with aortic valve and joint replacements and femoral fracture: a case report and literature review.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism caused by deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase and resulting in accumulation of homogentisic acid in collagenous structures.

Less common manifestations include cardiovascular abnormalities, renal, urethral and prostate calculi. Bone fractures are unusual in ochronosis. In this report, we describe a woman, 69 years of age, with a history of dark urine since childhood and progressive pigmentation of the skin, sclera, and auricular cartilages. She had severe arthropathy requiring total joint replacement in both of her knees and right hip. She also had severe aortic stenosis requiring valve replacement, and asymptomatic nephrolithiasis. She presented with a low trauma fracture of the distal femur despite two years of alendroate therapy. We review the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of alkaptonuric ochronosis. Early detection is important for prevention and treatment of multiple systems. Nitisinone, a potent inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, dramatically reduces production and urinary excretion of homogentisic acid; however, the long-term efficacy and side effects of such therapy are unknown.

This result, however, has to be confirmed on a larger group of patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>912</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Are Dp71 and Dp140 brain dystrophin isoforms related to cognitive impairment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy? </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>Molecular study and neuropsychological analysis were performed concurrently on 49 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) in order to find a molecular explanation for the cognitive impairment observed in most DMD patients .

Patients of Georgian origin were tested also for the Q359K/T360K mutation. In addition, all the patients were tested for the IVS-8 variant (9T/7T/5T). Of all the cystic fibrosis (CF)-bearing chromosomes, 94% (264/281) were accounted for by one of the known mutations, and none of the patients had the 5T allele of the IVS-8 variant. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the coding sequence of the CFTR gene followed by sequencing showed eight mutations on ten CF chromosomes, leaving seven chromosomes (2.5%) with unknown mutations. We identified three mutations in two or more CF chromosomes, 2571 + 1insT in Jews from Iraq, 3121-1G > A in patients from Kurdistan and I1234V in Yemenite Jewish patients. The other five mutations appeared on a single allele and are considered "private mutations." In this study we have identified 99% of CF alleles in Ashkenazi Jewish patients, 91% in Jews of North African origin and 75% in Jewish patients from Iraq. The significance of these findings to the population screening in Israel is discussed.</text></passage></document><document><id>914</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel rearrangement of chromosome band 22q11.2 causing 22q11 microdeletion syndrome-like phenotype and rhabdoid tumor of the kidney.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>133</offset><text>The 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome is the most frequent microdeletion syndrome in humans, yet its genetic basis is complex and is still not fully understood. Most patients harbor a 3-Mb deletion (typically deleted region [TDR]), but occasionally patients with atypical deletions, some of which do not overlap with each other and/or the TDR, have been described. Microduplication of the TDR leads to a phenotype similar, albeit not identical, to the deletion of this region. Here we present a child initially suspected of having 22q11 microdeletion syndrome, who in addition developed a fatal malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney. Detailed cytogenetic and molecular analyses revealed a complex de novo rearrangement of band q11 of the paternally derived chromosome 22. This aberration exhibited two novel features. First, a microduplication of the 22q11 TDR was associated with an atypical 22q11 microdeletion immediately telomeric of the duplicated region. Second, this deletion was considerably larger than previously reported atypical 22q11 deletions, spanning 2.8 Mb and extending beyond the SMARCB1/SNF5/INI1 tumor suppressor gene, whose second allele harbored a somatic frameshift-causing sequence alteration in the patient's tumor. Two nonallelic homologous recombination events between low-copy repeats (LCRs) could explain the emergence of this novel and complex mutation associated with the phenotype of 22q11 microdeletion syndrome.</text></passage></document><document><id>915</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Purification and functional reconstitution of the human Wilson copper ATPase, ATP7B.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>85</offset><text>Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism, due to inherited mutations in the Wilson copper ATPase gene ATP7B.

Ndntm2Stw mutant mice die shortly after birth because of abnormal respiratory rhythmogenesis generated by a key medullary nucleus, the pre-B  tzinger complex (preB  tC). Here, we address two fundamental issues relevant to its pathogenesis. First, we performed a detailed anatomical study of the developing medulla to determine whether there were defects within the preB  tC or synaptic inputs that regulate respiratory rhythmogenesis. Second, in vitro studies determined if the unstable respiratory rhythm in Ndntm2Stw mice could be normalized by neuromodulators. Anatomical defects in Ndntm2Stw mice included defasciculation and irregular projections of axonal tracts, aberrant neuronal migration, and a major defect in the cytoarchitecture of the cuneate/gracile nuclei, including dystrophic axons. Exogenous application of neuromodulators alleviated the long periods of slow respiratory rhythms and apnea, but some instability of rhythmogenesis persisted. We conclude that deficiencies in the neuromodulatory drive necessary for preB  tC function contribute to respiratory dysfunction of Ndntm2Stw mice. These abnormalities are part of a more widespread deficit in neuronal migration and the extension, arborization, and fasciculation of axons during early stages of central nervous system development that may account for respiratory, sensory, motor, and behavioral problems associated with PWS.</text></passage></document><document><id>917</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Congenital analbuminemia attributable to compound heterozygosity for novel mutations in the albumin gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>106</offset></passage></document><document><id>918</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of MYCBP as a beta-catenin/LEF-1 target using DNA microarray analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset><text>Abnormal activation of the beta-catenin signaling pathway can cause various types of cancer. Activation of Wnt pathway leads to stabilization of the beta-catenin protein, which results in its translocation to the nucleus and the formation of complexes with lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1) and other T-cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors to affect the transcription of target genes. However, the entrapment pattern of beta-catenin in the nucleus of normal epithelial cells differs from that in colon carcinoma cells. Normal epithelial cells may have different binding partners of beta-catenin and LEF-1 compared to tumor cells, which may result in differential expression of target genes. To investigate LEF-1-induced gene expression profiles, we used DNA microarrays to search the alterations of gene expression in normal epithelia versus cancer cells. Here, we reported 10 potential targets genes of beta-catenin/LEF-1. We showed that the expression of c-myc binding protein (MYCBP) in colon carcinoma cells was consistently upregulated by overexpressed LEF-1, which is confirmed by microarray data, RT-PCR and luciferase assay. We suggest that the MYCBP gene can be a direct target of beta-catenin/LEF-1 pathway through its LEF-1 binding site(s) in the MYCBP promoter, and that MYCBP up-regulation in colon carcinoma cell may play a co-activator role of c-MYC.</text></passage></document><document><id>919</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A combined genomewide linkage scan of 1,233 families for prostate cancer-susceptibility genes conducted by the international consortium for prostate cancer genetics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>166</offset><text>Evidence of the existence of major prostate cancer (PC)-susceptibility genes has been provided by multiple segregation analyses. Although genomewide screens have been performed in over a dozen independent studies, few chromosomal regions have been consistently identified as regions of interest. One of the major difficulties is genetic heterogeneity, possibly due to multiple, incompletely penetrant PC-susceptibility genes. In this study, we explored two approaches to overcome this difficulty, in an analysis of a large number of families with PC in the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). One approach was to combine linkage data from a total of 1,233 families to increase the statistical power for detecting linkage. Using parametric (dominant and recessive) and nonparametric analyses, we identified five regions with "suggestive" linkage (LOD score >1.86): 5q12, 8p21, 15q11, 17q21, and 22q12. The second approach was to focus on subsets of families that are more likely to segregate highly penetrant mutations, including families with large numbers of affected individuals or early age at diagnosis. Stronger evidence of linkage in several regions was identified, including a "significant" linkage at 22q12, with a LOD score of 3.57, and five suggestive linkages (1q25, 8q13, 13q14, 16p13, and 17q21) in 269 families with at least five affected members. In addition, four additional suggestive linkages (3p24, 5q35, 11q22, and Xq12) were found in 606 families with mean age at diagnosis of &lt; or = 65 years. Although it is difficult to determine the true statistical significance of these findings, a conservative interpretation of these results would be that if major PC-susceptibility genes do exist, they are most likely located in the regions generating suggestive or significant linkage signals in this large study.</text></passage></document><document><id>920</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Detection and characterization of point mutations in the choroideremia candidate gene by PCR-SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>By making use of positional cloning strategies we recently isolated a candidate gene for choroideremia (CHM), which is transcribed in retina, choroid, and/or retinal pigment epithelium.

Classic MLH1 mutations cause an approximately 20-fold increase in colorectal cancer susceptibility. Recently, we identified a hypomorphic allele, MLH1 D132H , which impairs, but does not completely eliminate the function of MLH1 in tumor suppression. MLH1 D132H confers an approximately fivefold increase in colorectal cancer susceptibility and was first described in a cohort of Israeli colorectal cancer patients, with an estimated allele frequency of 1.3 percent. Because MLH1 D132H has only recently been described, the ethnic distribution of this risk allele is not well understood. This study was undertaken to determine both the frequencies of this risk allele in ethnic groups outside of Israel and whether families harboring this mutation have susceptibility to extracolonic cancers in the hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer spectrum. METHODS: We genotyped two independent cohorts: 629 population-based colorectal cancer patients ascertained from clinics in Orange, Imperial, and San Diego Counties, and 515 endometrial cancer patients ascertained from gynecologic oncology clinics in the Midwestern United States. RESULTS: MLH1 D132H was not detected in either study cohort, which together totaled more than 1,100 American colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: The MLH1 D132H risk variant has significantly lower allele frequency in American compared with Israeli cancer patients and, alone, is unlikely to explain significant amounts of American sporadic colorectal cancer or uterine cancer susceptibility. Genetic testing for the MLH1 D132H allele exclusively is therefore unlikely to be cost effective for genetic risk assessment in American population-based and clinic-based colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>922</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>NBS1 knockdown by small interfering RNA increases ionizing radiation mutagenesis and telomere association in human cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>Hypomorphic mutations which lead to decreased function of the NBS1 gene are responsible for Nijmegen breakage syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disorder that imparts an increased predisposition to development of malignancy. The NBS1 protein is a component of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex that plays a critical role in cellular responses to DNA damage and the maintenance of chromosomal integrity. Using small interfering RNA transfection, we have knocked down NBS1 protein levels and analyzed relevant phenotypes in two closely related human lymphoblastoid cell lines with different p53 status, namely wild-type TK6 and mutated WTK1. Both TK6 and WTK1 cells showed an increased level of ionizing radiation-induced mutation at the TK and HPRT loci, impaired phosphorylation of H2AX (gamma-H2AX), and impaired activation of the cell cycle checkpoint regulating kinase, Chk2. In TK6 cells, ionizing radiation-induced accumulation of p53/p21 and apoptosis were reduced. There was a differential response to ionizing radiation-induced cell killing between TK6 and WTK1 cells after NBS1 knockdown; TK6 cells were more resistant to killing, whereas WTK1 cells were more sensitive. NBS1 deficiency also resulted in a significant increase in telomere association that was independent of radiation exposure and p53 status. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that NBS1 deficiency in human cells leads to hypermutability and telomere associations, phenotypes that may contribute to the cancer predisposition seen among patients with this disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>923</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Molecular pathogenesis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>54</offset><text>The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene encoding the WAS protein (WASP).

PolyQ diseases show a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat length and age of disease onset (AO). Despite this, individuals with identical repeat expansion alleles can have highly variable disease onset indicating that other factors also influence AO. We examined AO in 148 individuals in 57 sibships from the SCA2 founder population in Cuba. The mutant CAG repeat allele explained 57% of AO variance. To estimate heritability of the residual variance after correction for SCA2 repeat length, we applied variance component analysis and determined the coefficient of intraclass correlation. We found that 55% of the residual AO variance was familial. To test candidate modifier alleles in this population, we selected 64 unrelated individuals from a set of 394 individuals who were highly discordant for AO after correction for SCA2 CAG repeat length. We hypothesized that long normal alleles in the other 8 polyQ disease genes were associated with premature disease onset in SCA2. Of the 8 genes tested, only long normal CAG repeats in the CACNA1A gene were associated with disease onset earlier than expected based on SCA2 CAG repeat size using non-parametric tests for alleles (P &lt; 0.04) and genotypes (P &lt; 0.023) after correction for multiple comparisons. CACNA1A variation explained 5.8% of the residual variation in AO. The CACNA1A calcium channel subunit represents an excellent candidate as a modifier of disease in SCA2. It is highly expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) and is essential for the generation of the P/Q current and the complex spike in PCs. In contrast to other polyQ proteins, which are nuclear, the CACNA1A and SCA2 proteins are both cytoplasmic. Furthermore, small pathologic expansions of the polyQ domain in the CACNA1A protein lead to PC degeneration in SCA6. Future studies are needed to determine whether the modifier effect of CACNA1A relates to neuronal dysfunction or cell death of Purkinje neurons.</text></passage></document><document><id>925</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cone-rod dystrophy, intrafamilial variability, and incomplete penetrance associated with the R172W mutation in the peripherin/RDS gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>PURPOSE: To determine the underlying molecular genetic basis of a retinal dystrophy identified in a 5-generation family, and to examine the phenotype and degree of intrafamilial variability. DESIGN: Family genetic study. PARTICIPANTS: Nine affected individuals from a nonconsanguineous British family. METHODS: Ophthalmologic examination, color vision testing, fundus photography, autofluorescence imaging, and electrophysiological assessment were performed. The clinical notes of 2 additional deceased affected family members were also reviewed. Blood samples were taken for DNA extraction, with linkage analysis being performed, and subsequent mutation screening of the peripherin/RDS gene. RESULTS: Linkage analysis established a disease interval on chromosome 6p, which harbored the retinal candidate gene, peripherin/RDS. The 3 coding exons of the peripherin/RDS gene were subsequently screened for mutations in affected and unaffected family members. A nonconservative missense substitution, Arg172Trp (R172W), segregated uniquely in all affected subjects. The majority of subjects carrying the R172W peripherin/RDS mutation complained of reduced central vision starting in the second or third decade, with subsequent gradual deterioration of visual acuity and color vision. Three affected individuals complained of nyctalopia. A range of macular appearances were seen, varying from a typical granular appearance to extensive macular atrophy. Autofluorescence imaging in the majority of individuals identified a highly characteristic speckled macular appearance. All affected subjects had abnormal pattern electroretinograms (ERGs) consistent with macular dysfunction and 4 subjects showed additional full-field ERG abnormalities, providing evidence of generalized retinal dysfunction. There was marked variation in the clinical phenotype in those individuals who carried the R172W peripherin/RDS mutation, ranging from severe cone-rod dystrophy to asymptomatic individuals with normal retinal function. CONCLUSIONS: The Arg172Trp (R172W) peripherin/RDS mutation has been previously reported to cause a fully penetrant progressive macular dystrophy with high intrafamilial and interfamilial consistency of phenotype. This is the first report describing marked intrafamilial variation associated with this mutation, including nonpenetrance. These findings are clinically important in relation to advice on prognosis and accurate genetic counseling.</text></passage></document><document><id>926</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Jade-1, a candidate renal tumor suppressor that promotes apoptosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>Medical therapies are lacking for advanced renal cancer, so there is a great need to understand its pathogenesis. Most renal cancers have defects in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor pVHL. The mechanism by which pVHL protein functions in renal tumor suppression remains unclear. Jade-1 is a short-lived, kidney-enriched transcription factor that is stabilized by direct interaction with pVHL. Loss of Jade-1 stabilization by pVHL correlates with renal cancer risk, making the relationship between Jade-1 and renal cancer compelling. We report that Jade-1 expression was barely detectable in all tested renal cancer cell lines, regardless of VHL status. Strikingly, proteasome inhibitor treatment increased endogenous Jade-1 expression up to 10-fold. Jade-1 inhibited renal cancer cell growth, colony formation, and tumor formation in nude mice. Intriguingly, Jade-1 also affected the pattern of cell growth in monolayer culture and 3D culture. Jade-1 increased apoptosis by 40-50% and decreased levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Antisense Jade-1-expressing cells confirmed these results. Therefore, Jade-1 may suppress renal cancer cell growth in part by increasing apoptosis. Jade-1 may represent a proapoptotic barrier to proliferation that must be overcome generally in renal cancer, perhaps initially by pVHL inactivation and subsequently by increased proteasomal activity. Therefore, Jade-1 may be a renal tumor suppressor.</text></passage></document><document><id>927</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Deletion of FMR1 in Purkinje cells enhances parallel fiber LTD, enlarges spines, and attenuates cerebellar eyelid conditioning in Fragile X syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>150</offset><text>Absence of functional FMRP causes Fragile X syndrome.

In cancer, loss of specific genetic material frequently accompanies simultaneous inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. It is not known whether the Y chromosome harbors such genes. To address the role of genes on the Y chromosome in human prostate cancer, we transferred a tagged Y chromosome into PC-3, a human prostate cancer cell line lacking a Y chromosome. A human Y chromosome was tagged with the hisD gene and transferred to PC-3 by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. Tumorigenicity of these PC-3 hybrids was tested in vivo and in vitro, and the results were compared with those of the polymerase chain reaction analyses conducted on the PC-3 hybrids using Y chromosome-specific markers. Among 60 mice injected with 12 different PC-3 hybrids (five mice per hybrid), tumor growth was apparent in only one mouse, whereas tumors grew in all mice injected with the parental PC-3 cells. An in vitro assay showed that the Y chromosome did not suppress anchorage-independent growth of PC-3 cells. We found that addition of the Y chromosome suppressed tumor formation by PC-3 in athymic nude mice, and that this block of tumorigenesis was independent of the in vitro growth properties of the cells. This observation suggests the presence of a gene important for prostate tumorigenesis on the Y chromosome.</text></passage></document><document><id>929</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular analysis of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiencies: novel mutations and the spectrum of Japanese mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>146</offset><text>Inherited mutation of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, (HPRT) gives rise to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or HPRT-related gout.

To define the specific role of ATM in lymphomagenesis, we studied T-cell lymphomas isolated from mice with mutations in ATM and/or p53 using cytogenetic analysis and mRNA transcriptional profiling. The analyses identified genes misregulated as a consequence of the amplifications, deletions and translocation events arising as a result of ATM loss.

Mutations in the PEX1 gene, which consists of 24 exons and encodes a AAA ATPase protein required for peroxisomal protein import, account for approximately two-thirds of the known Zellweger spectrum patient mutations. In this paper, we report on four novel PEX1 mutations and two polymorphisms in an Australasian cohort. Two of the mutations--c.1108_1109insA and c.2391_2392delTC--that lead to the introduction of a premature termination codon in exons 5 and 14, respectively, are associated with the severe Zellweger phenotype. One patient with a milder disease phenotype was a compound heterozygote for two missense mutations (I989T and R998Q), both affecting amino acids in the second, C-terminal AAA domain of the protein. PTS1 protein import levels in cultured skin fibroblasts from this patient were almost 20% of normal control levels. We have also characterized two co-segregating polymorphisms in the 5' UTR of the PEX1 gene. Based on reporter assays, the c.-137T>C polymorphism leads to reduced PEX1 expression, whereas the c.-53C>G polymorphism leads to increased expression. When present together, these regulatory polymorphisms lead to near-normal PEX1 expression. Altered PEX1 expression due to the presence of either the c.-137T>C or the c.-53C>G variant could impact on residual PEX1 function if another co-allelic mutation was present which did not completely abolish PEX1 function. It also follows that the presence of polymorphisms in the PEX1 promoter region could have implications for patients with mutations in other PEX proteins known to interact with PEX1, such as PEX6. Thus, although not deleterious in control individuals, these polymorphisms could contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity among Zellweger spectrum patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>932</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) polymorphism modifies the Alzheimer's disease risk associated with APOE epsilon4 allele.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>Cholesterol regulates the production of amyloid beta (Abeta), which is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with high cellular cholesterol promoting and low cellular cholesterol reducing Abeta in vitro and in vivo.

Our data suggest that CETP behaves as a modifier gene of the AD risk associated with the APOE epsilon4 allele, possibly through modulation of brain cholesterol metabolism.</text></passage></document><document><id>933</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in FAP patients carrying germ line MYH mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal condition caused by inherited mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or in the MYH genes. Clinical trials have established that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are effective in preventing the development as well as reducing the size and decreasing the number of adenomas in FAP patients. Our aim was to evaluate the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in surgical specimens from patients with no evidence of germ line APC mutations but carrying germ line MYH mutations. COX-2 expression was evaluated through immunohistochemical and mRNA analysis in carcinomas, adenomas, and healthy mucosa from six patients carrying germ line biallelic MYH mutations. A modulation of COX-2 expression from adenoma (lower level) to carcinoma (higher level) was observed in all patients by both immunohistochemical and mRNA analysis. Moreover, patients with MYH mutations showed a weak COX-2 expression in the whole colorectal mucosa, as for classic FAP patients carrying germ line APC mutations. All together, our data suggest that biallelic MYH patients might benefit from NSAID treatment, because in these patients COX-2 is overexpressed in the whole colorectal mucosa, a finding possibly related to the interplay between COX-2 and APC protein being the APC gene a common target of mutations in MYH patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>934</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Small eye (Sey): cloning and characterization of the murine homolog of the human aniridia gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>Phenotypic parallels and genetic evidence from comparative mapping suggest that the murine Small eye (Sey) and human aniridia (AN) disorders are homologous.

METHODS: 170 patients with polyposis coli, who previously tested negative for APC mutations, were screened by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing to identify MYH germline mutations. RESULTS: Homozygous and compound heterozygous MYH mutations were identified in 40 patients (24%). No difference was found in the percentage of biallelic mutation carriers between patients with 10-99 polyps or 100-1000 polyps (29% in both groups). Colorectal cancer was found in 26 of the 40 patients with MAP (65%) within the age range 21 to 67 years (median 45). Complete endoscopic reports were available for 16 MAP patients and revealed five cases with gastro-duodenal polyps (31%), one of whom also presented with a duodenal carcinoma. Breast cancer occurred in 18% of female MAP patients, significantly more than expected from national statistics (standardised morbidity ratio = 3.75). CONCLUSIONS: Polyp numbers in MAP patients were equally associated with the attenuated and classical polyposis coli phenotypes. Two thirds of the MAP patients had colorectal cancer, 95% of whom were older than 35 years, and one third of a subset of patients had upper gastrointestinal lesions. Endoscopic screening of the whole intestine should be carried out every two years for all MAP patients, starting from age 25-30 years. The frequent occurrence of additional extraintestinal manifestations, such as breast cancer among female MAP patients, should be thoroughly investigated.</text></passage></document><document><id>936</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The DCC protein and prognosis in colorectal cancer. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset><text>BACKGROUND  Allelic loss of chromosome 18q predicts a poor outcome in patients with stage II colorectal cancer . Although the specific gene inactivated by this allelic loss has not been elucidated , the DCC ( deleted in colorectal cancer ) gene is a candidate . We investigated whether the expression of the DCC protein in tumor cells is a prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma . METHODS  The expression of DCC was evaluated immunohistochemically in 132 paraffin-embedded samples from patients with curatively resected stage II and III colorectal carcinomas . The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to adjust for covariates including age , sex , tumor site , degree of tumor differentiation , and use of adjuvant therapy . RESULTS  The expression of DCC was a strong positive predictive factor for survival in both stage II and stage III colorectal carcinomas . In patients with stage II disease whose tumors expressed DCC , the five-year survival rate was 94 . 3 percent , whereas in patients with DCC-negative tumors , the survival rate was 61 . 6 percent ( P &lt; 0 . 001 ) . In patients with stage III disease , the respective survival rates were 59 . 3 percent and 33 . 2 percent ( P = 0 . 03 ) . CONCLUSIONS  DCC is a prognostic marker in patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer . In stage II colorectal carcinomas , the absence of DCC identifies a subgroup of patients with lesions that behave like stage III cancers .

A review of the literature of atypical NKH cases reveals three forms: neonatal, infantile, and late onset. The presentation in the neonatal form is similar to the classical one but the subsequent outcome is significantly better. Mental retardation and behavioral abnormalities are prevalent in both infantile and late onset forms although the phenotype in late onset atypical NKH is more heterogeneous. Patients with the atypical NKH tend to have a lower CSF/plasma glycine ratio when compared with the classical form, but overlap occurs. Hyperglycinemia in the neonatal and infantile atypical NKH, similar to the classical form, is caused by a deficient glycine cleavage system, whereas the cause of hyperglycinemia in late onset atypical NKH is unknown. A mutation of the T-protein AMT gene and several mutations of P-protein GLDC gene have been identified in homozygous or compound heterozygous state. Some of the GLDC mutations are associated with residual glycine decarboxylase activity when expressed in COS7 cells and early therapeutic intervention may be crucial to improve the outcome in patients harboring such mutations. Identification of more mutations causing atypical NKH and information about the mutations' effect on enzyme activity may help to predict patients with a milder phenotype as well as those who may respond to early therapeutic intervention.</text></passage></document><document><id>940</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Structural basis of hereditary coproporphyria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>47</offset><text>Hereditary coproporphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the half-normal activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO), a mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing the antepenultimate step in heme biosynthesis. The mechanism by which CPO catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation, in an extraordinary metal- and cofactor-independent manner, is poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of human CPO at 1.58-A resolution. The structure reveals a previously uncharacterized tertiary topology comprising an unusually flat seven-stranded beta-sheet sandwiched by alpha-helices. In the biologically active dimer (K(D) = 5 x 10(-7) M), one monomer rotates relative to the second by approximately 40 degrees to create an intersubunit interface in close proximity to two independent enzymatic sites. The unexpected finding of citrate at the active site allows us to assign Ser-244, His-258, Asn-260, Arg-262, Asp-282, and Arg-332 as residues mediating substrate recognition and decarboxylation. We favor a mechanism in which oxygen serves as the immediate electron acceptor, and a substrate radical or a carbanion with substantial radical character participates in catalysis. Although several mutations in the CPO gene have been described, the molecular basis for how these alterations diminish enzyme activity is unknown. We show that deletion of residues (392-418) encoded by exon six disrupts dimerization. Conversely, harderoporphyria-causing K404E mutation precludes a type I beta-turn from retaining the substrate for the second decarboxylation cycle. Together, these findings resolve several questions regarding CPO catalysis and provide insights into hereditary coproporphyria.</text></passage></document><document><id>941</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genotype-phenotype correlations in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>Germ-line mutations of the tumor suppressor APC are implicated in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( AAPC ) , a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) .

METHODS: We describe the clinical and genetic features of a two-generation, seven-member Native Indian family with recurrent encephalopathy and FHM. RESULTS: Two of the three affected family members presented initially with encephalopathy, the third family member presented with classic episodes of migraine and hemiparesis. The CACNA1A gene locus was excluded in this family by haplotype analysis and no mutations were identified in the coding region of the ATP1A2 gene by direct sequencing.

One hundred forty-two patients with clinically, biochemically, and genetically diagnosed WD were studied. The mutational analysis of ATP7B was performed by direct sequencing. A total number of 26 mutations in ATP7B were identified. The p.His1069Gln was the most common mutation (allelic frequency: 72%). Seventy-three patients were homozygous for this mutation. Of compound heterozygotes, 37 had frameshift/nonsense mutation, and 20 had other missense mutation on one of their ATP7B alleles. Twelve patients had two non-p.H1069Q mutations. Patients homozygous for the p.H1069Q mutation had the less severe disturbances of copper metabolism and the latest presentation of first WD symptoms. The most severely disturbed copper metabolism and the earliest age at initial disease manifestation was noticed in non-p.H1069Q patients. In compound heterozygotes, the type of mutation coexisting with the p.H1069Q to a small extent influenced WD phenotype. The phenotype of WD varied considerably among patients with the same genotype. The p.H1069Q mutation is associated with late WD manifestation and with a mild disruption of copper metabolism. In compound heterozygotes, the phenotype of WD to a small extent depends on the type of mutation coexisting with the p.H1069Q.

Partial growth hormone (GH) deficiency is common, and GH treatment to PWS children and adults has shown beneficial effects on body composition. In this study, we have evaluated indices of GH's lipolytic effect in 6 PWS adults analysing glycerol, lactate and glucose in dialysate from microdialysis in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. The patients were four men and two women, 19-37 years old; all hypogonadal. BMI was 24.2-49.1, mean 35.9 kg/m(2). All had normal serum insulin levels. They received GH therapy (Genotropin Pfizer) during 12 months and doses were individually titrated to normal serum IGF-I for age. Immediately before treatment start and at 12 months, 30-36 h after the last GH injection, sampling of dialysate was carried out at night (11 p.m. to 7 a.m.), as well as after intravenously injection of a standardised GH dose (0.8 mg). At baseline individual mean night time glycerol and lactate were similar to levels in adults without PWS (160.7-278.1 micromol/L and 0.80-3.99 mmol/L, respectively), and did not change with 12 months GH treatment. Glucose levels were normal, except in a patient with diabetes, and did not change during the study. Compared to baseline the immediate effect of GH injection resulted in a significant increase in glycerol levels after 12 months. In conclusion, night time lipolytic response in this small group of PWS adults seemed normal and did not change after 12 months GH treatment. On the other hand short-term GH induced lipolysis increased, indicating normal lipolytic response in PWS.</text></passage></document><document><id>949</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Relationship between HLA-DR, HLA-DQ alleles and MEFV gene mutations in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>116</offset><text>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Three missense mutations clustered on the carboxyl-terminal portion of the MEFV gene (M680I, M694V, and V726A) have been observed in over 80% of affected alleles in several ethnic groups of familial Mediterranean fever patients. Several immunologic abnormalities were found both in cellular and humoral components in Mediterranean fever patients. Those observations have pointed the way for analysis of the HLA region in Mediterranean fever. We intended to compare HLA DR/DQ alleles with those major mutations in the MEFV gene in Mediterranean fever patients. METHODS: The distribution of MEFV gene mutations and HLA-DR, HLA-DQ alleles were analyzed in 40 index Turkish Mediterranean fever patients, 28 family members and 42 healthy controls. M680I, M694V, and V726A mutations were studied by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) analysis. HLA-DR and DQ allele subgroups were studied using SSP-PCR technique. RESULTS: A total of 37 (92.5%) patients in 40 Mediterranean fever index patients were found to carry one of the three missense mutations. The HLA-DR4 allele frequency was significantly higher in the Mediterranean fever patient group. When comparisons were made between Mediterranean fever mutations and HLA allele frequencies, M694V mutation with HLA DR3, DR11/5 and DR 13/6 and M680I mutation with DR7 allele subgroups were statistically significant. DQ6/1, DQ7/3, and DQ8/3 allele with M694V, DQ2 allele with M680I, and DQ6/1 with V726A mutations were also statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a relationship between some HLA-DR/DQ alleles and MEFV mutations in Mediterranean fever patients. We suggest HLA-DR/DQ alleles and their role in the pathogenesis of Mediterranean fever need further analysis and comparative studies.</text></passage></document><document><id>950</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 regulates gene expression for orderly mitotic progression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Germline mutations of the BRCA1 gene confer an increased risk for breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

DNA microarray and confirmatory RNA analyses revealed that BRCA1 small interfering (si) RNA caused down-regulation of multiple genes implicated in the mitotic spindle checkpoint (eg., BUB1B, HEC, and STK6), chromosome segregation (eg., ESPL1, NEK2, and PTTG1), centrosome function (eg., ASPM), cytokinesis (eg., PRC1, PLK, and KNSL2), and the progression into and through mitosis (eg., CDC2, and CDC20). Cells treated with BRCA1-siRNA showed attenuation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint; but not several G2 checkpoints.

We previously demonstrated that SHP-2 played an important role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. In the present studies, we have provided evidence that SHP-2 functions in DNA damage apoptosis and G2/M arrest in catalytically dependent and independent manners, respectively. Mutant embryonic fibroblasts with the Exon 3 deletion mutation in SHP-2 showed decreased apoptosis and diminished G2/M arrest in response to cisplatin treatment. Wild type (WT), but not catalytically inactive mutant SHP-2 (SHP-2 C459S), rescued the apoptotic response of the mutant cells. Interestingly, both WT and SHP-2 C459S efficiently restored the G2/M arrest response. Furthermore, inhibition of the catalytic activity of endogenous SHP-2 in WT cells by overexpression of SHP-2 C459S greatly decreased cell death but not G2/M arrest induced by cisplatin. Biochemical analyses revealed that activation of c-Abl kinase was decreased in SHP-2 C459S-overexpressing cells. However, DNA damage-induced translocation of Cdc25C from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was fully restored in both WT and SHP-2 C459S "rescued" cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that the role of SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced cellular responses was independent of the tumor suppressor p53. Embryonic stem cells with the SHP-2 deletion mutation showed markedly decreased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, attributed to impaired induction of p73 but not p53. In agreement with these results, DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest were also decreased in SHP-2/p53 double mutant embryonic fibroblasts. Collectively, these studies have further defined the mechanisms by which SHP-2 phosphatase regulates DNA damage responses.</text></passage></document><document><id>952</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Effects of cadmium on the gene expression of retinoblastoma (Y79) cells in culture].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset><text>We examined the effects of cadmium on the mRNA levels of several genes in cultured retinoblastoma (Y79) cells.

Although the androgen receptor (AR) is suggested to play an important role in prostate cancer progression even after the androgen ablation, limited tissue availability for molecular studies and small numbers of human prostate cancer cell lines have restricted prostate cancer research. Here, we describe KUCaP, a novel serially transplantable human prostate cancer xenograft model. We established KUCaP from liver metastatic tissue of a patient treated with antiandrogen bicalutamide. KUCaP expressed the AR with a point mutation at amino acid 741 (tryptophan to cysteine; W741C) in the ligand-binding domain. This mutation was also present in cancerous tissue used for generation of KUCaP. Although the growth of KUCaP in male mice was androgen dependent, bicalutamide aberrantly promoted the growth and prostate-specific antigen production of KUCaP. For the first time, we show the agonistic effect of bicalutamide to a xenograft with clinically induced AR mutation. This bicalutamide-responsive mutant AR will serve in the development of new therapies for androgen ablation-resistant prostate cancers.</text></passage></document><document><id>954</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genome-wide linkage of febrile seizures and epilepsy to the FEB4 locus at 5q14.3-q23.1 and no MASS1 mutation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset><text>Febrile seizures (FS) represent the most common seizure disorder in childhood and contribution of a genetic predisposition has been clearly proven. In some families FS is associated with a wide variety of afebrile seizures. Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a familial epilepsy syndrome with a spectrum of phenotypes including FS, atypical febrile seizures (FS+) and afebrile generalized and partial seizures. Mutations in the genes SCN1B, SCN1A and GABRG2 were identified in GEFS+ families. GEFS+ is genetically heterogeneous and mutations in these three genes were detected in only a minority of the families. We performed a 10 cM density genome-wide scan in a multigenerational family with febrile seizures and epilepsy and obtained a maximal multipoint LOD score of 3.12 with markers on chromosome 5q14.3-q23.1. Fine mapping and segregation analysis defined a genetic interval of approximately 33 cM between D5S2103 and D5S1975. This candidate region overlapped with a previously reported locus for febrile seizures (FEB4) in the Japanese population, in which MASS1 was proposed as disease gene. Mutation analysis of the exons and exon-intron boundaries of MASS1 in our family did not reveal a disease causing mutation.

However, our mutation data is negative and do not support a role for MASS1 suggesting that another gene within or near the FEB4 locus might exist.</text></passage></document><document><id>955</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Unusual cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with fronto-temporal dementia phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disease caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme 27-sterol hydroxylase (CYP27). We report a 53-year-old man, with an unusual phenotype of CTX. He had xanthomas since adolescence. He had no mental retardation and developed at 44 years a progressive neuropsychiatric phenotype, suggestive of fronto-temporal dementia according to clinical Neary criteria. Cataract and ataxia were absent. Cerebral MRI revealed diffuse hyperintense T2 abnormalities in the supratentorial white matter without cerebellar atrophy or lesions, while Technetium-99m-ECD brain SPECT revealed a severe cerebellar hypoperfusion. Serum cholestanol level was elevated with excessive urinary bile alcohols excretion. Mutation analysis revealed that he was compound heterozygous for two mutations in the CYP27A1 gene: 1016 C > T (exon 5) on one allele and a novel mutation, 1435C > G (exon 8) on the other allele. A follow-up study was conducted to evaluate the effects of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and simvastatin treatment during 3 years. In spite of this treatment, cognitive functions declined but no other signs of neurological deterioration appeared.</text></passage></document><document><id>956</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Disease concordance, zygosity, and NOD2/CARD15 status: follow-up of a population-based cohort of Danish twins with inflammatory bowel disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>143</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: A Danish cohort of twins with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), has previously been collected. The aim of the present study was to reassess this cohort in order to compare clinical characteristics in concordant versus discordant twin pairs, test twin zygosity genetically, follow-up on disease concordance, and examine NOD2/CARD15 genetic status. METHODS: The Danish cohort is one of two population-based cohorts worldwide and consists of 103 twin pairs. After median 13 yr of follow-up, all twins were contacted and hospital files were scrutinized to reassess disease concordance and obtain phenotype data. DNA was obtained from 123 twins for analysis of zygosity and prevalence of the three common NOD2/CARD15 mutations. RESULTS: Zygosity tested genetically was consistent with the former assessment based on questionnaires. The proband concordance for CD remained fairly stable: 63.6% among monozygotic (MZ) twins and 3.6% among dizygotic (DZ) twins. Clinical characteristics were similar in twins from concordant versus discordant pairs. Forty-four percent of patients with CD were positive for >or=1 mutant allele of NOD2/CARD15 compared to 2% of UC patients (p &lt; 0.001) and 19% of healthy twins (p= 0.02). The allele mutation frequency was 43% among the healthy twins to patients with CD versus 9% among twins to UC patients (p= 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Previous questionnaire assessment of twin zygosity was confirmed by genetic test. Concordance for CD remained quite stable and was significantly higher among MZ than DZ twins. A high NOD2/CARD15 mutation frequency was observed both among CD twins and their healthy siblings.</text></passage></document><document><id>957</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An interactive web database of factor H-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome mutations: insights into the structural consequences of disease-associated mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>163</offset><text>Factor H (FH) is a central complement regulator comprised of 20 short complement repeat (SCR) domains. Nucleotide changes within this gene (CFH) have been observed in patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and also membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and age-related macular degeneration. All parts of FH are affected, but many mutations are clustered in the C-terminal part of FH. Up to now, structural analyses of HUS have been based on SCR-20, a domain that is involved in FH interactions with C3b, heparin, and endothelial cells. In order to identify the structural and functional consequence of HUS mutations, further disease-associated mutations were analyzed in terms of homology and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) models for factor H SCR domains. An interactive web database of 54 human HUS-associated mutations and others was created from the literature (www.FH-HUS.org). This has comprehensive search and analysis tools, integrating phenotypic and genetic data with structural analysis. Each mutation can be highlighted on the SCR structure together with the patient FH and C3 levels where available. Two new insights were obtained from our collection of data. First, phenotypic data on FH clarify our previously-proposed classification of Type I and Type II disorders that both lead to HUS, where Type I affects FH secretion and folding, and Type II leads to expressed protein in plasma that is functionally defective. Second, the new mutations show more clearly that SCR domains from SCR-16 to SCR-19 are important for the ligand binding activities of FH as well as SCR-20. This FH web database will facilitate the interpretation of new mutations and polymorphisms when these are identified in patients, and it will clarify the functional role of FH.</text></passage></document><document><id>958</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Linkage study of Machado-Joseph disease: genetic evidence for the locus different from SCA1].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>95</offset><text>Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) is the locus symbol of hereditary olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and it is mapped on the short arm of chromosome 6.

Ppp2r5c and Dnchc1 at the telomeric end of the analyzed sequence are biallelically expressed, suggesting that the imprinted domain does not extend beyond the paternally expressed Dio3 gene. RT-PCR experiments support the predicted presence of a maternally expressed intergenic transcript(s) encompassing Gtl2, Rian, and Mirg. These maternally expressed genes, and also the intergenic transcript(s), show pronounced expression in the adult mouse brain, whereas the paternally transcribed Dio3 and the nonimprinted Ppp2r5c and Dnchc1 are expressed in different tissues.

The transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), and activating protein-1 (AP-1) play a critical role in IL-2 gene expression. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms of impaired IL-2 production after T-cell receptor ligation in T cells deficient in WAS protein (WASP). METHODS: T cells from WASP-/- mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Nuclear NF-kappaB, NF-AT, and AP-1 DNA-binding activity was examined by electroshift mobility assay. NF-ATp dephosphorylation and nuclear localization were examined by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence. Phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk and Jnk, and of their nuclear substrates Elk-1 and c-Jun, was examined by Western blot. Expression of mRNA for IL-2 and the NF-kappaB-dependent gene A20 and of the AP-1 components c-fos and c-Jun was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Nuclear translocation and activity of NF-kappaB were normal in T cells from WASP-/- mice. In contrast, NF-ATp dephosphorylation and nuclear localization, nuclear AP-1 binding activity, and expression of c-fos, but not c-Jun, were all impaired. Phosphorylation of Jnk, c-Jun, and Erk were normal. However, nuclear translocation of phosphorylated Erk and phosphorylation of its nuclear substrate Elk1, which activates the c-fos promoter, were impaired. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that WASP is essential for NF-ATp activation, and for nuclear translocation of p-Erk, Elk1 phosphorylation, and c-fos gene expression in T cells. These defects underlie defective IL-2 expression and T-cell proliferation in WAS.</text></passage></document><document><id>962</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>On the formula for admixture linkage disequilibrium.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>Admixture linkage disequilibrium (ALD), a phenomenon created by gene flow between genetically distinct populations, has for some time been used as a tool in gene mapping. It is therefore important to analyze the pattern of ALD over generations. In this study we explore two models of admixture: the gradual admixture (GA) model, in which admixture occurs at a variable rate in every generation; and the immediate admixture (IA) model, a special case of the GA model, in which admixture occurs in a single generation. In the case of ALD, the well-known formula of linkage disequilibrium (Delta(t)=(1-r)t Delta(0)) is not applicable under these two models. We note the effect of a random mating population (RMP) to the gametic frequencies from the parental population to the offspring population, and provide the correct formula for ALD.</text></passage></document><document><id>963</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cooperation between BRCA1 and p53 in repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>DNA repair defects can predispose to cancer development and progression. We previously showed that the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene product BRCA1, through p53, upregulates expression of the XPE gene DDB2 encoding the nucleotide excision repair protein p 48. Both XPE and XPC are p53 target genes containing p53 response elements. To further explore the role of BRCA1 and p53 in repair of photoproducts, we eliminated wild type p53 from U2OS osteosarcoma cells and found that cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) repair was markedly impaired following UV damage whereas repair of 6-4 photoproduct (6-4 PP) occurred efficiently. Overexpression of p53 in p53-null Calu-6 cells also enhanced CPD repair. In HCC1937 breast cancer cells, harboring mutant BRCA1 and p53 genes, repair of CPD was markedly impaired. Reintroduction of either p53 or BRCA1 using adenovirus vectors into HCC1937 alone had little effect on repair of CPD whereas the combination of p53 and BRCA1 resulted in efficient repair of CPD. Thus there appears to be a cooperative effect between p53 and BRCA1 that may involve induction of repair proteins, inhibition of p53-induced cell death by BRCA1 with altered p53 selectivity towards repair pathways and/or p53-independent effects of BRCA1 on CPD repair.</text></passage></document><document><id>964</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel Arg362Ser mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27): its effects on pre-mRNA splicing and enzyme activity. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>A novel C to A mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene ( CYP27 ) was identified by sequencing amplified CYP27 gene products from a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX ) .

Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of CYP27 gene mRNA in the patient represented 52 . 5 % of the normal level . As the mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 ( -2 position of exon 6-intron 6 splice site ) of the gene , we hypothesized that the mutation may partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative splicing elsewhere , which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient . Transfection of constructed minigenes , with or without the mutation , into COS-1 cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mRNA species alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5 splice site 88 bp upstream from the 3 end of exon 6 .

This mutation eliminates the ability of HFE to associate with beta2-microglobulin ( beta2m ) and prevents cell-surface expression . A second mutation that has no effect on beta2m association , H63D , was found in eight out of nine patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutant . In this report , we demonstrate in cultured 293 cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant HFE proteins that both the wild-type and H63D HFE proteins form stable complexes with the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) . The C282Y mutation nearly completely prevents the association of the mutant HFE protein with the TfR . Studies on cell-associated transferrin at 37 degrees C suggest that the overexpressed wild-type HFE protein decreases the affinity of the TfR for transferrin . The overexpressed H63D protein does not have this effect , providing the first direct evidence for a functional consequence of the H63D mutation . Addition of soluble wild-type HFE / beta2m heterodimers to cultured cells also decreased the apparent affinity of the TfR for its ligand under steady-state conditions , both in 293 cells and in HeLa cells . Furthermore , at 4 degrees C , the added soluble complex of HFE / beta2m inhibited binding of transferrin to HeLa cell TfR in a concentration-dependent manner . Scatchard plots of these data indicate that the added heterodimer substantially reduced the affinity of TfR for transferrin . These results establish a molecular link between HFE and a key protein involved in iron transport , the TfR , and raise the possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis . . </text></passage></document><document><id>966</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Neonatal epilepsy syndromes and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset></passage></document><document><id>967</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Deletion of and novel missense mutation in POU3F4 in 2 families segregating X-linked nonsyndromic deafness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the physical manifestations and genetic features of 2 families segregating X-linked deafness, which is most commonly reported to be caused by mutations of the POU domain gene POU3F4 at the DFN3 locus. DESIGN: Computed tomographic study of the temporal bone in probands from each family, followed by mutation screening and deletion mapping of POU3F4 in family members. SETTING: Two midwestern genetics clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Two families with X-linked deafness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anomalies of the inner ear in the probands; results of gene mapping and severity and effects of hearing loss in the family members. RESULTS: In the first family, a large deletion was identified that includes POU3F4 and extends upstream approximately 530 kilobases; in the second family, a novel serine-to-leucine (S228L) amino acid mutation was identified in the POU-specific domain of POU3F4. Both the deletion and the missense mutation segregate with the clinical phenotype and are causally related to the deafness in these families. CONCLUSIONS: Deafness related to the POU3F4 gene is associated with dilation of the internal auditory canal and a spectrum of other temporal bone anomalies that range in severity from mild to severe dysplasia of the cochlea and semicircular canals. The consequence of these anomalies is a congenital mixed hearing loss, the sensorineural component of which progresses over time. Affected males can also present with vestibular dysfunction that is associated with delayed developmental motor milestones. Intrafamilial variability occurs.</text></passage></document><document><id>968</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>X-linked imprinting: effects on brain and behaviour.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner and can affect brain and behavioural phenotypes. The X chromosome is enriched for genes affecting neurodevelopment and is donated asymmetrically to male and female progeny. Hence, X-linked imprinted genes could potentially influence sexually dimorphic neurobiology. Consequently, investigations into such loci may provide new insights into the biological basis of behavioural differences between the sexes and into why men and women show different vulnerabilities to certain mental disorders. In this review, we summarise recent advances in our knowledge of X-linked imprinted genes and the brain substrates that they may act upon. In addition, we suggest strategies for identifying novel X-linked imprinted genes and their downstream effects and discuss evolutionary theories regarding the origin and maintenance of X-linked imprinting.</text></passage></document><document><id>969</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV: N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase mutations in Tunisian patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>97</offset><text>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA; OMIM #253000) or Morquio A syndrome is an autosomal recessive inborn error resulting from the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), and the progressive lysosomal accumulation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Clinically, the severe form of this lysosomal storage disease is characterized by a characteristic severe bone dysplasia and normal intelligence. To date, a variety of mutations have been associated with the severe MPS IVA phenotype. Here, we report the GALNS mutations in six severe MPS IVA patients from four unrelated Tunisian families. For mutation detection, each of the 14 exons and adjacent intron-exon junctions of the GALNS gene were sequenced after PCR-amplification from genomic DNA. Two novel mutations were identified: a G to A transition in the conserved 5' donor splice site of intron 1 (GACgt-->GACat: designated IVS1(+1g-->a)) and a G to C transversion in codon 66 of exon 2 predicting a glycine to arginine substitution (G66R). The IVS1(+1g-->a) mutation was homozygous in five similarly affected patients from three presumably unrelated families, but haplotype analysis suggested a common ancestor. The affected patient in the fourth family was homozygous for the G66R mutation. These are the first GALNS mutations causing severe MPS IVA disease identified in Tunisia. These molecular findings provide genotype/phenotype correlations, and permit accurate carrier detection, prenatal diagnosis, and counseling for MPS IVA disease in Tunisia where first cousin consanguineous mating remains frequent.</text></passage></document><document><id>970</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>How are humans related to other primates?

We genotyped 33 late-onset Cretan HD chromosomes, 9 Cretan typical HD chromosomes and 114 Cretan control chromosomes using 14 STR markers and 20 SNPs that map to 4p16.3. In contrast to the typical HD pedigrees, the late-onset HD families lacked anticipation and juvenile cases. The expanded CAG repeat (36-42 units) in these families remained either stable or it showed small increment instability, even when transmitted through the father. All late-onset HD chromosomes shared a conserved haplotype defined by the markers D4S95: 1090, D4S127: 157, rs362277: A, rs3025814: G, rs2530596: A that span a 0.277-Mb segment on 4p16.3. Coalescence analysis traced this haplotype to a founder who lived about 1000 years ago. In contrast, each of the two typical HD disease pedigrees derived from a different founder. Sequencing of a 5-kb DNA segment immediately upstream of the HD gene revealed a novel single nucleotide polymorphism at -1757 bp relative to the translation start site, which was more prevalent in Cretan than in North American chromosomes. All late-onset HD families on Crete arose from a common founder with the disease's mutation evolving over the centuries via small-increment instability.

However, the effects of high levels of potentially toxic substances such as sulfatides--which accumulate in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)--on this regenerative ability are still largely unclear. To start addressing this question, in vitro and in vivo experiments were used to examine the behavior of multipotential neural precursors exposed to abnormally high levels of sulfatides. Following transplantation of dissociated neurospheres into the brain of presymptomatic MLD pups, the majority of donor-derived cells were distributed in a caudal to rostral direction, with higher numbers in the cortex. Most if not all of the donor cells acquired an astroglial phenotype. We found no evidence of oligodendrocyte or neuronal commitment of transplanted cells in long-term-treated MLD mice (e.g. up to 1.5 years of age). This was in line with our in vitro findings of sulfatides blocking oligodendrocyte formation after induction of differentiation in sulfatide-treated epidermal growth factor/fibroblast growth factor responsive neurospheres. Transplanted MLD mice showed an improved arylsulfatase A (ARSA) activity and a significant amelioration of sulfatide metabolism, neurodegeneration and motor-learning/memory deficits. Furthermore, transplanted cells were shown to act as a source of ARSA enzyme that accumulated in endogenous brain cells, indicating the occurrence of enzyme cross-correction between transplanted and host cells. These results provide a first insight into the effect of sulfatides on the stemness properties of neural stem cells and on the effects of the MLD environment on the in vivo expectations of using neural stem cells in cell therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>975</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Inherited afibrinogenemia caused by compound heterozygous mutations in the beta beta-chain of fibrinogen].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>Congenital afibrinogenemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by the complete absence or extremely reduced level of fibrinogen.

VWF was characterized by a low plasmatic level, an abnormal binding to platelet GPIb and a high capacity of secretion from endothelial cells following DDAVP infusion. Using site-directed mutagenesis and expression in mammalian cells, we have investigated the impact of these mutations upon the multimerization, secretion and storage of VWF. Using COS-7 cells both mutated recombinant VWF (rVWF) displayed only lower molecular weight multimers. Pulse-chase analysis and endoglycosidase H digestion experiments showed the intracellular retention of mutated rVWF in pre-Golgi compartments. Study of hybrid rVWF obtained with a constant amount of wild-type (WT) DNA and increasing proportions of mutated plasmids established that both substitutions reduced the release of WT VWF in a dose-dependent manner and failed to form high molecular weight multimers. Using transfected AtT-20 stable cell lines, we observed similar granular storage of the two mutants and WT rVWF. Our data suggest that cysteines 1157 and 1234 play a crucial role in the early step of the folding of the molecule required for a normal transport pathway, maturation and constitutive secretion. In contrast, their substitution does not prevent the storage and inducible secretion of VWF.</text></passage></document><document><id>977</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Carriers and patients with muscle-eye-brain disease can be rapidly diagnosed by enzymatic analysis of fibroblasts and lymphoblasts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>132</offset><text>We report a new fibroblast and lymphoblast based protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 enzymatic assay, which allows rapid and accurate diagnosis of carriers and patients with muscle-eye-brain type of congenital muscular dystrophy. Seven patients with genetically confirmed muscle-eye-brain disease were assayed for protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 enzyme activity. In three patients and their heterozygous parents, the assays were done on EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, in another three patients they were done on cultured fibroblasts and in the last patient on both fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. Cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from the muscle-eye-brain patients showed a highly significant decrease in protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 activity relative to controls. The residual protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 level in fibroblasts (average 0.11 nmoles/h per mg) was about 13% of normal controls. The ratio of protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 activity to the activity of a glycosyltransferase control (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1; GnT1) in fibroblasts was on average 0.006 in muscle-eye-brain patients and 0.045 in controls. The average residual protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 level in lymphoblasts was 15% of normal controls. The average ratio of protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1/GnT1 activity was 0.007 in muscle-eye-brain patients, 0.026 in heterozygous carriers and 0.046 in normal controls. Assay of protein O-mannosyl beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 activity in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from muscle-eye-brain carriers and patients provides a rapid and relatively simple diagnostic test for this disease and could be used as a screening test in carriers and patients with complex congenital muscular dystrophy.</text></passage></document><document><id>978</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BACH1 Ser919Pro variant and breast cancer risk.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>48</offset><text>BACKGROUND: BACH1 (BRCA1-associated C-terminal helicase 1; also known as BRCA1-interacting protein 1, BRIP1) is a helicase protein that interacts in vivo with BRCA1, the protein product of one of the major genes for hereditary predisposition to breast cancer. Previously, two BACH1 germ line missense mutations have been identified in early-onset breast cancer patients with and without family history of breast and ovarian cancer. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether there are BACH1 genetic variants that contribute to breast cancer risk in Finland. METHODS: The BACH1 gene was screened for germ line alterations among probands from 43 Finnish BRCA1/2 negative breast cancer families. Recently, one of the observed common variants, Ser-allele of the Ser919Pro polymorphism, was suggested to associate with an increased breast cancer risk, and was here evaluated in an independent, large series of 888 unselected breast cancer patients and in 736 healthy controls. RESULTS: Six BACH1 germ line alterations were observed in the mutation analysis, but none of these were found to associate with the cancer phenotype. The Val193Ile variant that was seen in only one family was further screened in an independent series of 346 familial breast cancer cases and 183 healthy controls, but no additional carriers were observed. Individuals with the BACH1 Ser919-allele were not found to have an increased breast cancer risk when the Pro/Ser heterozygotes (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.70-1.16; p = 0.427) or Ser/Ser homozygotes (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.76-1.35; p = 0.91) were compared to Pro/Pro homozygotes, and there was no association of the variant with any breast tumor characteristics, age at cancer diagnosis, family history of cancer, or survival. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the BACH1 Ser919 is not a breast cancer predisposition allele in the Finnish study population. Together with previous studies, our results also indicate that although some rare germ line variants in BACH1 may contribute to breast cancer development, the contribution of BACH1 germline alterations to familial breast cancer seems marginal.</text></passage></document><document><id>979</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>15q duplication associated with autism in a multiplex family with a familial cryptic translocation t(14;15)(q11.2;q13.3) detected using array-CGH.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>147</offset><text>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with a strong genetic aetiology. In approximately 1% of cases, duplication of the 15q11-13 region has been reported. We report the clinical, array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and cytogenetic evaluation of two individuals from a multiplex family demonstrating autism due to a maternally inherited gain of 15q11-13. Our findings indicate that unlike most 15q11-13 gains, which are caused by interstitial duplication of this region or supernumerary marker chromosomes deriving from proximal 15q, the 15q gain in this family is the result of abnormal segregation of a cryptic familial translocation with breakpoints at 14q11.2 and 15q13.3. The affected members of this family were found to have a normal karyotype at >550 band resolution. This translocation was identified using the 1-Mb resolution whole genome array (Spectral Genomics). The affected individuals have a gain of seven clones from proximal 15q, a loss of two clones from proximal 14q and a gain of two clones from 6q. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with clones from chromosomes 14 and 15, combined with DAPI reverse banding, showed an abnormal karyotype with one normal chromosome 15 and the der(15) t(14;15)(q11.2.;q13.3), resulting in the gain of proximal 15q and the loss of proximal 14q in affected individuals. The duplication of two clones from 6q in the affected subjects was also found in unaffected members of the family. Our findings suggest that the gain of 15q in autism may in some cases be due to cryptic translocations with breakpoints in the pericentromic regions of chromosome 15 and a different acrocentric chromosome. Variation in the size of pericentromic regions of any acrocentric chromosome may justify karyotype and FISH studies of autistic probands and their parents using probes from the 15q proximal region to determine recurrence risk for autism in some families.</text></passage></document><document><id>980</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Consequences of copper accumulation in the livers of the Atp7b-/- (Wilson disease gene) knockout mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>Wilson disease is a severe genetic disorder associated with intracellular copper overload. The affected gene, ATP7B, has been identified, but the molecular events leading to Wilson disease remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that genetically engineered Atp7b-/- mice represent a valuable model for dissecting the disease mechanisms. These mice, like Wilson disease patients, have intracellular copper accumulation, low-serum oxidase activity, and increased copper excretion in urine. Their liver pathology developed in stages and was determined by the time of exposure to elevated copper rather than copper concentration per se. The disease progressed from mild necrosis and inflammation to extreme hepatocellular injury, nodular regeneration, and bile duct proliferation. Remarkably, all animals older than 9 months showed regeneration of large portions of the liver accompanied by the localized occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma arising from the proliferating bile ducts. The biochemical characterization of Atp7b-/- livers revealed copper accumulation in several cell compartments, particularly in the cytosol and nuclei. The increase in nuclear copper is accompanied by marked enlargement of the nuclei and enhanced DNA synthesis, with these changes occurring before pathology development. Our results suggest that the early effects of copper on cell genetic material contribute significantly to pathology associated with Atp7b inactivation.</text></passage></document><document><id>981</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Intronic breakpoint definition and transcription analysis in DMD/BMD patients with deletion/duplication at the 5' mutation hot spot of the dystrophin gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>156</offset><text>Dystrophin mutations occurring at the 5' end of the gene frequently behave as exceptions to the "frame rule," their clinical severity being variable and often not related to the perturbation of the translation reading frame. The molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic variability of 5' dystrophin mutations have not been fully clarified. We have characterized the genomic breakpoints within introns 2, 6 and 7 and identified the splicing profiles in a cohort of DMD/BMD patients with deletion of dystrophin exons 3-7, 3-6 and duplication of exons 2-4. Our findings indicate that the occurrence of intronic cryptic promoter as well as corrective splicing events are unlikely to play a role in exons 3-7 deleted patients phenotypic variability. Our data suggest that re-initiation of translation could represent a major mechanism responsible for the production of a residual dystrophin in some patients with exons 3-7 deletion. Furthermore, we observed that the out-of-frame exon 2a is almost constantly spliced into a proportion of the dystrophin transcripts in the analysed patients. In the exons 2-4 duplicated DMD patient, producing both in-frame and out-of-frame transcripts, this splicing behaviour might represent a critical factor contributing to the severe phenotype. In conclusion, we suggest that multiple mechanisms may have a role in modulating the outcome of 5' dystrophin mutations, including recoding mechanisms and unusual splicing choices.</text></passage></document><document><id>982</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Could steroids mask the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis, caused by impaired hydroxylation of cholesterol side chains due to deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), leading to accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in brain and other tissues. Elevated plasma cholestanol serves as a key marker for the clinical diagnosis of CTX. In the present report we describe a young man with CTX who was on high dose steroids for a misdiagnosed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and had normal level of serum cholestanol. When steroids were discontinued, markedly elevated serum cholestanol was measured concomitant with marked clinical worsening. This observation may imply that steroids can lower plasma cholestanol, possibly by directly inducing residual CYP27A1 activity or by inducing alternative pathways for cholestanol elimination.</text></passage></document><document><id>983</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A common cardiac sodium channel variant associated with sudden infant death in African Americans, SCN5A S1103Y.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>Thousands die each year from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Neither the cause nor basis for varied prevalence in different populations is understood. While 2 cases have been associated with mutations in type Valpha, cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels (SCN5A), the "Back to Sleep" campaign has decreased SIDS prevalence, consistent with a role for environmental influences in disease pathogenesis. Here we studied SCN5A in African Americans. Three of 133 SIDS cases were homozygous for the variant S1103Y. Among controls, 120 of 1,056 were carriers of the heterozygous genotype, which was previously associated with increased risk for arrhythmia in adults. This suggests that infants with 2 copies of S1103Y have a 24-fold increased risk for SIDS. Variant Y1103 channels were found to operate normally under baseline conditions in vitro. As risk factors for SIDS include apnea and respiratory acidosis, Y1103 and wild-type channels were subjected to lowered intracellular pH. Only Y1103 channels gained abnormal function, demonstrating late reopenings suppressible by the drug mexiletine. The variant appeared to confer susceptibility to acidosis-induced arrhythmia, a gene-environment interaction. Overall, homozygous and rare heterozygous SCN5A missense variants were found in approximately 5% of cases. If our findings are replicated, prospective genetic testing of SIDS cases and screening with counseling for at-risk families warrant consideration.</text></passage></document><document><id>984</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular genetics of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>56</offset><text>Rhabdoid tumors are extremely aggressive malignancies that generally occur in infants and young children. The most common locations are the kidney and central nervous system (atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor [RT]), although RTs can also arise in most soft-tissue sites. Rhabdoid tumors in all anatomical locations have a similar molecular origin. Mutation or deletion of both copies of the hSNF5/INI1 gene that maps to chromosome band 22q11.2 is observed in approximately 70% of primary tumors. An additional 20 to 25% of tumors have reduced expression at the RNA or protein level, indicative of a loss-of-function event. The INI1 protein is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. The complex is recruited to promoters of a large variety of genes involved in cell signaling, growth, and differentiation.

The gene contains five exons and four introns; the four coding exons span a region of approximately 2.4 kb. The 5' end of the COX5B gene is GC-rich and contains many HpaII sites. Genomic Southern blot analysis of human DNA probed with the human COX Vb cDNA identified eight restriction fragments containing COX Vb-related sequences that were mapped to different chromosomes with panels of human x Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. Because only one of these fragments hybridized with a 210-bp probe from intron 4, we conclude that there is a single expressed gene for COX subunit Vb in the human genome.

We previously reported that two strains of Apc gene-deficient mice developing multiple intestinal polyps exhibit a hyperlipidemic state. The triglyceride (TG) levels were approximately 10-fold higher than the levels observed in wild-type mice. METHODS: To examine whether a positive relationship might exist between hyperlipidemia and colorectal tumor development in FAP patients, as with Apc gene-deficient mice, a pilot experiment was performed using readily available clinical data such as ages, serum lipid levels, number of colorectal polyps and cancer development in 28 FAP patients from the National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of hyperlipidemia in FAP cases was 58%. Average TG levels in the 40-60 year age groups of FAP patients were > or =150 mg/dl (the defined threshold level of hyperlipidemia). Moreover, there was a tendency for higher serum TG levels in patients who developed colorectal cancer, as compared with those without colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a hyperlipidemic state occurs in FAP patients. Although it is weaker than that in Apc gene-deficient mice, it may be linked to colon tumor development. These data warrant further studies for wider populations of FAP patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>988</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Active role for nibrin in the kinetics of atm activation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>58</offset><text>The Atm protein kinase is central to the DNA double-strand break response in mammalian cells. After irradiation, dimeric Atm undergoes autophosphorylation at Ser 1981 and dissociates into active monomers. Atm activation is stimulated by expression of the Mre11/Rad50/nibrin complex. Previously, we showed that a C-terminal fragment of nibrin, containing binding sites for both Mre11 and Atm, was sufficient to provide this stimulatory effect in Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) cells. To discriminate whether nibrin's role in Atm activation is to bind and translocate Mre11/Rad50 to the nucleus or to interact directly with Atm, we expressed an Mre11 transgene with a C-terminal NLS sequence in NBS fibroblasts. The Mre11-NLS protein complexed with Rad50, localized to the nucleus in NBS fibroblasts, and associated with chromatin. However, Atm autophosphorylation was not stimulated in cells expressing Mre11-NLS, nor were downstream Atm targets phosphorylated. To determine whether nibrin-Atm interaction is necessary to stimulate Atm activation, we expressed nibrin transgenes lacking the Atm binding domain in NBS fibroblasts. The nibrin DeltaAtm protein interacted with Mre11/Rad50; however, Atm autophosphorylation was dramatically reduced after irradiation in NBS cells expressing the nibrin DeltaAtm transgenes relative to wild-type nibrin. These results indicate that nibrin plays an active role in Atm activation beyond translocating Mre11/Rad50 to the nucleus and that this function requires nibrin-Atm interaction.</text></passage></document><document><id>989</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Priming phosphorylation of Chk2 by polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) mediates its full activation by ATM and a downstream checkpoint in response to DNA damage.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>152</offset><text>The tumor suppressor gene Chk2 encodes a serine/threonine kinase that signals DNA damage to cell cycle checkpoints. In response to ionizing radiation, Chk2 is phosphorylated on threonine 68 (T68) by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein leading to its activation. We have previously shown that polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3), a protein involved in DNA damage checkpoint and M-phase functions, interacts with and phosphorylates Chk2. When Chk2 was immunoprecipitated from Daudi cells (Plk3-deficient), it had weak kinase activity towards Cdc25C compared with Chk2 derived from T47D cells (Plk3-expressing cells). This activity was restored by addition of recombinant Plk3 in a dose-dependent manner. Plk3 phosphorylates Chk2 at two residues, serine 62 (S62) and serine 73 (S73) in vitro, and this phosphorylation facilitates subsequent phosphorylation of Chk2 on T68 by ATM in response to DNA damage. When the Chk2 mutant construct GFP-Chk2 S73A (serine 73 mutated to alanine) is transfected into cells, it no longer associates with a large complex in vivo, and manifests a significant reduction in kinase activity. It is also inefficiently activated by ATM by phosphorylation at T68 and, in turn, is unable to phosphorylate the Cdc25C peptide 200-256, which contains the inhibitory S216 target phosphorylation residue. As a consequence, tyrosine 15 (Y15) on Cdc2 remains hypophosphorylated, and there is a loss of the G2/M checkpoint. These data describe a functional role for Plk3 in a pathway linking ATM, Plk3, Chk2, Cdc25C and Cdc2 in cellular response to DNA damage.</text></passage></document><document><id>990</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Voltage-dependent gap junction channels are formed by connexin32, the major gap junction protein of rat liver.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>111</offset><text>We report here experiments undertaken in pairs of hepatocytes that demonstrate a marked voltage sensivity of junctional conductance and, thus, contradict earlier findings reported by this laboratory (Spray, D.C., R.D.ginzberg, E.A., E.

The analysis of the tumor material showed that (I) tumor-specific deletions were very rare: one homozygous deletion out of 30 tumors analysed, (2) hemizygous deletions were not observed in any of the tumors. The homozygous deletion in one patient spans 220 kb and is composed of a tumor-specific translocation associated with a deletion on one chromosome and a deletion of about 220 kb on the other chromosome at the same site. The WT-33 Wilms' tumor candidate gene maps to this deleted segment. A small constitutional deletion of 1,300 kb was identified in a patient with WT and genital tract malformations.

The Villefranche criteria have simplified its diagnosis, which, however, remains difficult in children and young adults with vascular and hypermobile EDS as well as in patients without a positive family history. Diagnosis of vascular EDS is important for clinical follow-up, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. We describe the biochemical and molecular-genetic diagnosis of vascular EDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe five families with vascular EDS. Analysis of (pro)collagens obtained from cultured fibroblasts was done using SDS-PAGE. The structure and amounts of (pro)collagen I, III and V were determined by autoradioflourography. This was also done in 362 controls or patients without a diagnosis of vascular EDS. Molecular testing was done in Professor Anne de Paepe's laboratory in Belgium by sequencing of COL3A1. RESULTS: (Pro)collagen from all five patients with vascular EDS was abnormal by SDS-PAGE: intracellular retention, reduced secretion and overmodification of the a1 chains of (pro)collagen III. Molecular analysis revealed an abnormality of COL3A1 in all patients. Abnormalities of (pro)collagen III were not observed in patients without a diagnosis of vascular EDS. Among 90 patients with non-vascular EDS, one patient had an abnormality of collagen I. DISCUSSION: Biochemical analysis of (pro)collagen obtained from cultured fibroblasts is a good screening procedure for vascular EDS, but it is of limited value in non-vascular EDS. Molecular testing will disclose an abnormality of COL3A1 in many patients with abnormal (pro)collagen III on SDS-PAGE. The findings make precise genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis possible in families with vascular EDS.</text></passage></document><document><id>993</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Eye movement abnormalities correlate with genotype in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>We compared horizontal eye movements ( visually guided saccades , antisaccades , and smooth pursuit ) in control subjects ( n = 14 ) and patients with three forms of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias type I spinocerebellar ataxias 1 and 2 ( SCA1 , n = 11 ; SCA2 , n = 10 ) and SCA3 / Machado-Joseph disease ( MJD ) ( n = 16 ) .

METHODS: The family was identified by applying the Amsterdam and Bethesda Criteria. Immunohistochemistry was performed, and DNA samples isolated from tumor tissue were evaluated for microsatellite instability. The identification of possible mutations was carried out by sequencing the hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes. RESULTS: Two different mutations were observed in the index patient and in his family members. The first mutation was located in exon 7, codon 422 of hMSH2, and caused a change from Glu to STOP codon. No other report of such a mutation has been published, as far as we could find in the international databases. The second mutation was found in exon 3 codon 127 of the hMSH2 gene, resulting in Asp-->Ser substitution. The second mutation was already published, as a non-pathogenic allelic variation. CONCLUSION: The pedigree analysis suggested that the newly detected nonsense mutation in exon 7 of the hMSH2 gene might be responsible for the development of colon cancers. In family members where the exon 7 mutation is not coupled with this missense mutation, colon cancer appears after the age of 40. The association of these two mutations seems to decrease the age of manifestation of the disease into the early thirties.</text></passage></document><document><id>995</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The broad spectrum of autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease: molecular bases, clinical features and long-term follow-up in 31 patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>137</offset><text>Autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorders, including autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease (DALD), are inherited defects of the Fas apoptotic pathway characterized by lymphoid accumulation and autoimmune manifestations.

METHODS: The frequency was estimated by assaying the mutation in series of French Canadian breast cancer cases diagnosed before age 41 (n = 60) or 80 (n = 127) years of age, and ovarian cancer cases (n = 80) unselected for family history of cancer by mutation analysis. Haplotype analysis was performed to determine if mutation carriers shared a common ancestry. Members from 11 families were analyzed using six polymorphic microsatellite markers (cen-D13S260-D13S1699-D13S1698-D13S1697-D13S1701-D13S171-tel) spanning approximately a 3.6 cM interval at the chromosomal region 13q13.1, which contains BRCA2. Allele frequencies were estimated by genotyping 47 unaffected female individuals derived from the same population. Haplotype reconstruction of unaffected individuals was performed using the program PHASE. RESULTS: The recurrent BRCA2 mutation occurred in 1 of 60 (1.7%) women diagnosed with breast cancer before 41 years of age and one of 80 (1.3%) women with ovarian cancer. No mutation carriers were identified in the series of breast cancer cases diagnosed before age 80. Mutation carriers harboured one of two haplotypes, 7-3-9-3 - [3/4]-7, that varied with marker D13S1701 and which occurred at a frequency of 0.001. The genetic analysis of D13S1695, a polymorphic marker located approximately 0.3 cM distal to D13S171, did not favour a genetic recombination event to account for the differences in D13S1701 alleles within the haplotype. Although mutation carriers harbour genotypes that are frequent in the French Canadian population, neither mutation-associated haplotype was plausible in reconstructed haplotypes of 47 individuals of French Canadian descent. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mutation carriers share a related ancestry; further supporting the concept that recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the French Canadian population could be attributed to common founders. This finding provides further support for targeted screening of recurrent mutations in this population before large-scale mutation analyses are performed.</text></passage></document><document><id>997</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Conserved family of glycerol kinase loci in Drosophila melanogaster.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>Glycerol kinase (GK) is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of glycerol 3-phosphate from ATP and glycerol, the rate-limiting step in glycerol utilization.

Using a combination of sequence analysis and evolutionary comparisons of orthologs between species, we characterized functional domains in the protein required for GK activity. Our findings include additional conserved domains that suggest novel nuclear and mitochondrial functions for glycerol kinase in apoptosis and transcriptional regulation.

Implications for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder biochemically characterized by elevated levels of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). Excess levels of VLCFAs are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD. Therefore, therapeutic approaches for X-ALD are focused on the reduction or normalization of VLCFAs. In this study, we investigated an alternative oxidation route for VLCFAs, namely omega-oxidation. The results described in this study show that VLCFAs are substrates for the omega-oxidation system in human liver microsomes. Moreover, VLCFAs were not only converted into omega-hydroxy fatty acids, but they were also further oxidized to dicarboxylic acids via cytochrome P450-mediated reactions. High sensitivity toward the specific P450 inhibitor 17-octadecynoic acid suggested that omega-hydroxylation of VLCFAs is catalyzed by P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP4A/F subfamilies. Studies with individually expressed human recombinant P450 enzymes revealed that two P450 enzymes, i.e. CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B, participate in the omega-hydroxylation of VLCFAs. Both enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 4F subfamily and have a high affinity for VLCFAs. In summary, this study demonstrates that VLCFAs are substrates for the human omega-oxidation system, and for this reason, stimulation of the in vivo VLCFA omega-oxidation pathway may provide an alternative mode of treatment to reduce the levels of VLCFAs in patients with X-ALD.</text></passage></document><document><id>999</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Efficient cDNA cloning by direct phenotypic correction of a mutant human cell line (HPRT-) using an Epstein-Barr virus-derived cDNA expression vector.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>151</offset><text>Human cells are, in general, poor recipients of foreign DNA, which has severely hampered the cloning of genes by direct phenotypic correction of deficient human cell lines after DNA mediated gene transfer. In this communication a methodology is presented which largely circumvents this problems. The method relies on the use of a recently developed episomal Epstein-Barr-virus-derived cDNA expression vector (Belt et al. (1989) Gene 84, 407-417). The cloning of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) cDNA, corresponding to a low abundant mRNA in wild type cells is used as a model system. Size fractionated poly (A)+ RNA from wild type cells, which resulted in an approximately 10 fold enrichment in HPRT mRNA, was used to construct a cDNA library of 25,000 independent clones in the pECV25 vector. An HPRT deficient human cell line was transfected and subsequently selected with hygromycin B for DNA uptake. In a small scale experiment only 7000 hygromycin BR transfectants were sufficient to isolate 2 independent HATR clones which were shown to replicate episomes harbouring HPRT cDNA. The first insert had a 5' untranslated region (UTR) and a 3' UTR perfectly in agreement with published data. The second cDNA clone harboured an unusually long 5' UTR and a shorter 3' UTR due to alternative polyadenylation of the HPRT transcript which has not been previously recognized.</text></passage></document><document><id>1000</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Factors influencing the latency of the peroxisomal enzyme dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase (DHAP-AT) in permeabilized human skin fibroblasts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>152</offset><text>In selectively permeabilized fibroblasts suspended in a medium mimicking the composition of the cytosol the peroxisomal enzyme dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase (DHAP-AT) was found to exhibit about 80% latency (Wolvetang, E.J., Tager, J.M. and Wanders, R.J.A. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1035, 6-11). We investigated which components of the cytosol mimicking medium are important for latency of DHAP-AT and unmasking of latent DHAP-AT activity by ATP. We show that the latency of DHAP-AT is critically dependent upon the presence of reduced glutathione in the medium and that the in vivo prevailing GSH/GSSG ratio is sufficient to maintain DHAP-AT latency. Although thiol-groups in the peroxisomal membrane seem to be essential for the integrity of peroxisomes in selectively permeabilized fibroblasts no latency of DHAP-AT is observed in buffered sucrose media or in cell homogenates, irrespective of the presence of GSH in the medium used. We suggest that during homogenization irreversible damage is inflicted upon the peroxisomal membrane and/or that more factors than at present investigated are involved in maintaining peroxisomal integrity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cations play a role in the stimulatory effect of ATP on latent DHAP-AT activity while a proton gradient is not directly involved in the stimulatory effect of ATP on latent DHAP-AT activity.</text></passage></document><document><id>1001</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Von Hippel-Lindau disease germline mutations in Mexican patients with cerebellar hemangioblastoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>OBJECT: Central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas are benign vascular tumors arising either sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a hereditary cancer syndrome. The authors studied a series of patients with CNS hemangioblastomas and their families to identify germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene and to establish a predictive testing and screening protocol. METHODS: Patients admitted between 2002 and 2004 to the Instituto Nacional de Neurolog  a y Neurocirug  a for hemangioblastoma were prospectively enrolled, together with their at-risk family members. The authors performed the molecular analysis of the VHL gene by using polymerase chain reaction and direct genetic sequencing. All asymptomatic mutation carriers underwent genetic counseling and tumor surveillance. Ninety-eight individuals were tested for VHL mutations--23 symptomatic and 75 asymptomatic individuals belonging to 16 families. Seven of the families had definite clinical criteria of VHL disease, five had sporadic hemangioblastoma, and four had CNS hemangioblastoma combined with minor visceral signs. Molecular genetic testing identified five germline mutations in six of the definite VHL families (sensitivity 85%), but none in the possible VHL and sporadic hemangioblastoma cases; four of these mutations had been previously described and one is a novel mutation present in two unrelated families. After patients carrying the mutation were identified, they underwent clinical screening and asymptomatic VHL-related lesions were identified in 43%. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing for mutations in the VHL gene is crucial in patients with CNS hemangioblastoma. The prompt identification of patients carrying the genetic mutation allows for a multidisciplinary screening protocol to decrease morbidity and mortality rates in these patients, while avoiding costly and invasive procedures for noncarriers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1002</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Inactivation of von Hippel-Lindau gene induces constitutive phosphorylation of MET protein in clear cell renal carcinoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>It is well known that inactivation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene predisposes for human clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC). However, details about critical roles of VHL inactivation during tumorigenesis are still unknown. MET protein is a tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), which regulates cell growth, cell morphology, and cell motility. We showed that MET protein overexpressed in CCRC cells was phosphorylated without HGF/SF. This constitutive phosphorylation of MET protein in CCRC cells was inhibited by the rescue of exogenous wild-type VHL gene without a decrease in expression level of MET protein. Interestingly, wild-type VHL gene suppressed the phosphorylation of MET protein only under high cell density conditions. Additionally, MET protein activated by the inactivation of VHL gene modified cell adherence, including N-cadherin and beta-catenin. When activation of MET protein in CCRC cells was inhibited by the MET inhibitor K252a, the growth of CCRC cells in vitro and the tumorigenesis induced by CCRC cells in nude mice were suppressed. From these results, we concluded that inactivation of VHL gene induced constitutive phosphorylation of MET protein and modified intercellular adherence structure to trigger the cell growth released from contact inhibition, finally resulting in tumorigenesis. This is one of the mechanisms of CCRC oncogenesis, and MET protein has potential as a molecular target for novel CCRC therapies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1003</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The thermodynamic stability theory of non-equilibrium States.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>62</offset><text>The paper by J.

BRCA mutations in suspected carriers, however, may be missed, which hampers genetic counselling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different clinicopathological features were compared between 22 breast cancers from carriers of proved BRCA1 mutations and 604 cancers from sporadic controls. In addition, 5 BRCA2-related breast cancers and 66 breast cancers of untested patients at intermediate risk and 19 breast cancers of untested patients at high risk of hereditary disease on the basis of family history were evaluated. RESULTS: A "probably sporadic" class (age >or=54 years and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) negative; 68% of cases) with a 0% chance of BRCA1-related breast cancer containing 79% of the sporadic cases was yielded by using a decision tree with age, Ki67 and EGFR. A 75% chance of BRCA1-related breast cancer was shown by the "probably BRCA1-related" class (age &lt;54 years and Ki67 >or=25%; 8% of cases) with 82% of the BRCA1-related cases but only 1.4% of the sporadic cases. Most cases at intermediate or high risk of hereditary disease on the basis of family history could be classified with high probability as either probably BRCA1 related or probably sporadic. CONCLUSION: Breast carcinomas can be classified with a high level of certainty as sporadic or related to BRCA1 germline mutations by using a decision tree with age, Ki67 and EGFR. This can be clinically useful in mutation analysis in families with a borderline risk of hereditary disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1007</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Significance of somatic mutations and content alteration of mitochondrial DNA in esophageal cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>BACKGROUND: The roles of mitochondria in energy metabolism, the generation of ROS, aging, and the initiation of apoptosis have implicated their importance in tumorigenesis. In this study we aim to establish the mutation spectrum and to understand the role of somatic mtDNA mutations in esophageal cancer. METHODS: The entire mitochondrial genome was screened for somatic mutations in 20 pairs (18 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, one adenosquamous carcinoma and one adenocarcinoma) of tumor/surrounding normal tissue of esophageal cancers, using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE), followed by direct DNA sequencing to identify the mutations. RESULTS: Fourteen somatic mtDNA mutations were identified in 55% (11/20) of tumors analyzed, including 2 novel missense mutations and a frameshift mutation in ND4L, ATP6 subunit, and ND4 genes respectively. Nine mutations (64%) were in the D-loop region. Numerous germline variations were found, at least 10 of them were novel and five were missense mutations, some of them occurred in evolutionarily conserved domains. Using real-time quantitative PCR analysis, the mtDNA content was found to increase in some tumors and decrease in others. Analysis of molecular and other clinicopathological findings does not reveal significant correlation between somatic mtDNA mutations and mtDNA content, or between mtDNA content and metastatic status. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that somatic mtDNA mutations in esophageal cancers are frequent. Some missense and frameshift mutations may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of esophageal carcinoma. More extensive biochemical and molecular studies will be necessary to determine the pathological significance of these somatic mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1008</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Systemic administration of IGF-I enhances oxidative status and reduces contraction-induced injury in skeletal muscles of mdx dystrophic mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>142</offset><text>The absence of dystrophin and resultant disruption of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex renders skeletal muscles of dystrophic patients and dystrophic mdx mice susceptible to contraction-induced injury. Strategies to reduce contraction-induced injury are of critical importance, because this mode of damage contributes to the etiology of myofiber breakdown in the dystrophic pathology. Transgenic overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) causes myofiber hypertrophy, increases force production, and can improve the dystrophic pathology in mdx mice. In contrast, the predominant effect of continuous exogenous administration of IGF-I to mdx mice at a low dose (1.0-1.5 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) is a shift in muscle phenotype from fast glycolytic toward a more oxidative, fatigue-resistant, slow muscle without alterations in myofiber cross-sectional area, muscle mass, or maximum force-producing capacity. We found that exogenous administration of IGF-I to mdx mice increased myofiber succinate dehydrogenase activity, shifted the overall myosin heavy chain isoform composition toward a slower phenotype, and, most importantly, reduced contraction-induced damage in tibialis anterior muscles. The deficit in force-producing capacity after two damaging lengthening contractions was reduced significantly in tibialis anterior muscles of IGF-I-treated (53 +/- 4%) compared with untreated mdx mice (70 +/- 5%, P &lt; 0.05). The results provide further evidence that IGF-I administration can enhance the functional properties of dystrophic skeletal muscle and, compared with results in transgenic mice or virus-mediated overexpression, highlight the disparities in different models of endocrine factor delivery.</text></passage></document><document><id>1009</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Alpha-galactosidase A gene mutation in a Chinese family with Fabry disease mimicking clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>137</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To screen gene mutation in alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) in a nonconsanguineous Chinese family with Fabry disease (FD) with clinical manifestations similar to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

DNA analysis of alpha-Gal A gene and physical and clinical examinations were performed in a female proband and in her relatives (15 subjects in total). RESULTS: Three hemizygotes and 6 heterozygotes were diagnosed for FD by the alpha-Gal A gene analysis with a missense mutation in exon 5 of the alpha-Gal A sequence, leading to a TGG32TGA substitution, which may induce the absent of tryptophan's translation (corresponded to TGG) by the terminator codon TGA. Six patients in the family were revealed as HCM by echocardiography.

In contrast, loss of p53 does not induce centrosome amplification in cultured human cells. However, examination of human cancer tissues and cultured cells has revealed a significant correlation between loss or mutational inactivation of p53 and occurrence of centrosome amplification, supporting the notion that p53 mutation alone is insufficient to induce centrosome amplification in human cells, and that additional regulatory mechanisms are involved. It has recently been shown that gamma irradiation of tumor cells induces centrosome amplification. However, the precise mechanism of radiation-induced centrosome amplification is not fully understood. In the present study, CCD32SK diploid normal human fibroblasts were transfected transiently with short interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for human p53 (CCD/p53i). There was a small increase in the frequency of centrosome amplification in CCD/p53i cells (4.0%) without irradiation. In contrast, CCD/p53i cells after 5-Gy irradiation showed a marked increase in abnormal nuclear shapes and pronounced amplification of centrosomes (46.0%). At 12 h after irradiation, irradiated CCD/p53i cells were arrested in G(2) phase. By laser scanning cytometry, abnormal mitosis with amplified centrosomes was observed frequently in the accumulating G(2)/M population at 48 h after irradiation. In the present study, we found that siRNA-mediated silencing of p53 in normal human fibroblasts, together with DNA damage by irradiation, efficiently induced centrosome amplification and nuclear fragmentation, but these phenomena were not observed with either siRNA-mediated silencing of p53 or irradiation alone.</text></passage></document><document><id>1011</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for rapid detection of proteolipid protein 1 gene duplications and deletions in affected males and carrier females with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>199</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is a rare X-linked neurodegenerative disorder caused by sequence variations in the proteolipid protein 1 gene (PLP1). PLP1 gene duplications account for approximately 50%-75% of cases and point variations for approximately 15%-20% of cases; deletions and insertions occur infrequently. We used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect PLP1 gene alterations, especially gene duplications and deletions. METHODS: We performed MLPA on 102 samples from individuals with diverse PLP1 gene abnormalities and from controls, including 50 samples previously characterized for the PLP1 gene by quantitative PCR but which were anonymized for prior results and sex. RESULTS: All males with PLP1 gene duplications (n = 13), 1 male with a triplication, 2 males with whole gene deletions, and all controls (n = 72) were unambiguously assigned to their correct genotype. Of 4 female carriers tested by MLPA and quantitative PCR, 3 were duplication carriers by both methods, and 1 was a triplication carrier by MLPA and a duplication carrier by quantitative PCR. For 1 sample with a partial deletion, MLPA showed exon 3 deleted but PCR showed exons 3 and 4 deleted. Sequence analysis of 2 samples with reduced dosage for exons 3 and 5 revealed point variations overlapping the annealing site for the corresponding MLPA probe. The precision of MLPA analysis was excellent and comparable to or better than quantitative PCR, with CVs of 4.3%-9.8%. CONCLUSIONS: MLPA is a rapid and reliable method to determine PLP1 gene copies. Samples with partial PLP1 gene dosage alterations require confirmation with a non-MLPA method.</text></passage></document><document><id>1012</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>DNA damage-induced BARD1 phosphorylation is critical for the inhibition of messenger RNA processing by BRCA1/BARD1 complex.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>BRCA1-associated RING domain protein BARD1, along with its heterodimeric partner BRCA1, plays important roles in cellular response to DNA damage.

ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 enhances the DNA damage checkpoint functions of BRCA1, but how BARD1 is regulated during DNA damage signaling has not been examined. Here, we report that BARD1 undergoes phosphorylation upon ionizing radiation or UV radiation and identify Thr(714) as the in vivo BARD1 phosphorylation site. Importantly, DNA damage functions of BARD1 (i.e., inhibition of pre-mRNA polyadenylation and degradation of RNA polymerase II) are abrogated in T714A and T734A mutants.

To rapidly detect all possible changes within the coding and splice site determining sequences of the breast cancer genes, we established a semiautomated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) mutation scanning system. All exons of both genes are covered by the DGGE scan, comprising 120 amplicons. We use a semiautomated approach, amplifying all individual amplicons with the same PCR program, after which the amplicons are pooled. DGGE is performed using three slightly different gel conditions. Validation was performed using DNA samples with known sequence variants in 107 of the 120 amplicons; all variants were detected. This DGGE mutation scanning, in combination with a PCR test for two Dutch founder deletions in BRCA1 was then applied in 431 families in which 52 deleterious changes and 70 unclassified variants were found. Fifteen unclassified variants were not reported before. The system was easily adopted by five other laboratories, where in another 3,593 families both exons 11 were analyzed by the protein truncation test (PTT) and the remaining exons by DGGE. In total, a deleterious change (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site mutation, or large deletion) was found in 661 families (16.4%), 462 in BRCA1 (11.5%), 197 in BRCA2 (4.9%), and in two index cases a deleterious change in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 was identified. Eleven deleterious changes in BRCA1 and 36 in BRCA2 had not been reported before. In conclusion, this DGGE mutation screening method for BRCA1 and BRCA2 is proven to be highly sensitive and is easy to adopt, which makes screening of large numbers of patients feasible. The results of screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in more than 4,000 families present a valuable overview of mutations in the Dutch population.</text></passage></document><document><id>1015</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An increased coronary risk is paradoxically associated with common cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene variations that relate to higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a population-based study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>204</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Several cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) polymorphisms affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but the impact of CETP gene variants on incident coronary disease in the general population is uncertain after correction for their effect on HDL cholesterol.

The unadjusted coronary hazard was 1.26 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-1.68; P = 0.11] in A carriers compared with CC homozygotes and increased to 1.46 (95% CI, 1.10-1.95; P = 0.01) after adjustment for HDL cholesterol. This effect remained after additional adjustment for apolipoprotein A-I, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, age, and gender. Likewise, the HDL-cholesterol-adjusted hazard ratio was also higher in AA than in CC homozygotes (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.22-2.42; P &lt; 0.01). Similar findings were obtained with the TaqIB polymorphism. The 405V allele was weakly associated with incident coronary heart disease after HDL cholesterol adjustment (P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: A common CETP promoter polymorphism, which beneficially contributes to higher HDL cholesterol, is paradoxically associated with increased incidence of coronary disease in the general population. Thus, CETP gene variation may affect coronary risk apart from the level of HDL cholesterol.</text></passage></document><document><id>1016</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene in familial polyposis coli patients and sporadic colorectal tumors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>We have isolated several genes in the chromosome 5q21 region tightly linked to hereditary familial polyposis coli (FAP) and Gardner's syndrome (GS). Two of these genes (MCC and APC) were found to be somatically altered by point mutation, deletion or insertion in tumors of sporadic colorectal cancer patients. One of them (adenomatous polyposis coli; APC) was also found to mutate in the germ-line of both APC and GS patients. The identification of these genes has significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia and for the diagnosis and counseling of individuals with inherited predispositions to colorectal cancer. Furthermore, in one colon carcinoma, we identified an interesting mechanism causing dysfunction of the APC gene. This gene was disrupted by a somatic insertion of a long interspersed repetitive element (LINE-1 sequence: L1) into the last exon. As an insertional sequence contains a 3' portion of the L1 consensus sequence including the poly(A) tract and an 8 bp target-site duplication was observed, this insertion is suspected to be caused by a retrotranscriptional insertion of one of the L1 sequences. This is the first case of the disruption of a tumor suppressor gene by the insertion of a movable genetic element.</text></passage></document><document><id>1017</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Comprehensive screening of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia mutations in Japanese population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) is among the most genetically heterogeneous skeletal dysplasias. Six genes involved in MED, COMP, MATN3, COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, and DTDST have been identified; however, the presence of additional disease genes has been reported, and the detection rate for mutations in known genes accounts for no more than 50% of patients with MED in Western populations. Here, we screened the six known disease genes in 35 consecutive Japanese MED patients. We analyzed the entire coding region of each gene, along with flanking intron-exon junctions, by direct sequencing. A total of 19 mutations were identified in COMP, MATN3, COL9A2, COL9A3, and DTDST. The detection rate for known mutations was higher in this study than in previous reports, and we identified a substantially different spectrum of mutations. Mutations in MATN3 were more prevalent among these Japanese patients, whereas no DTDST mutations were detected. Most of the mutations were localized within specific regions of each gene: COMP mutations were found in the calmodulin-like repeat domains; MATN3 mutations in the von Willebrand factor type A domain; and type IX collagen gene mutations occurred in the third collagenous domains. Based on the integration of clinical and genetic information, we propose an algorithm for detecting mutations in Japanese MED patients.

Seven regions are defined by this panel, two of which lie between DXS369 and DXS296, until now the closest genetic markers that flank FRAXA. Of those two interesting regions, one is just distal to DXS369 and defined by probe 2-71 (DXS476), which is not polymorphic. The next one contains probes St677 (DXS463) and 2-34 (DXS477), which are within 130 kb and both detect TaqI RFLPs. The combined informativeness of these two probes is 30%. We cloned from an irradiation-reduced hybrid line another new polymorphic probe, Do33 (DXS465; 42% heterozygosity). This probe maps to the DXS296 region, proximal to a chromosomal breakpoint that corresponds to the Hunter syndrome locus (IDS). The physical order is thus Cen-DXS369-DXS476-(DXS463,DXS477)-(DXS296, DXS465)-IDS-DXS304-tel. We performed a linkage analysis for five of these markers in both the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families and in a large set of fragile-X families. This establishes that DXS296 is distal to FRAXA. The relative position of DXS463 and DXS477 with respect to FRAXA remains uncertain, but our results place them genetically halfway between DXS369 and DXS304. Thus the DXS463-DXS477 cluster defines presently either the closest proximal or the closest distal polymorphic marker with respect to FRAXA. The three new polymorphic probes described here have a combined heterozygosity of 60% and represent a major improvement for genetic analysis of fragile-X families, in particular for diagnostic applications.</text></passage></document><document><id>1019</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The molecular defect in type IIB von Willebrand disease.

Using the PCR, one of a panel of four potential missense mutations was identified in each of the 14 patients studied from 11 unrelated families. None of these substitutions was encountered in a large panel of normal DNAs. These changes all represent C----T transitions at CpG dinucleotides, proposed "hot spots" for mutation in the human genome. The four resulting amino acid substitutions, Arg543----Trp, Arg545----Cys, Val553----Met, and Arg578----Gln, are all clustered within the GpIb binding domain of vWF. Disruption of this latter functional domain may explain the pathogenesis of Type IIB vWD. By sequence polymorphism analysis, the Arg543----Trp substitution was shown to have occurred as at least two independent mutational events. This latter observation, along with the identification of mutations in all 14 patients studied and their localization to the GpIb binding domain, all strongly suggest that these substitutions represent the authentic defects responsible for Type IIB vWD. This panel of mutations may provide a useful diagnostic tool for the majority of patients with Type IIB vWD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1020</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutational analysis of the PRYSPRY domain of pyrin and implications for familial mediterranean fever (FMF).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal, recessively inherited disease, characterized by recurrent fever and serositis that affects mainly patients of the Mediterranean basin.

Based on a recent molecular analysis of MEFV gene mutations in 43 patients from Crete aiming to correlate specific genotypes and clinical manifestations of FMF, we were prompted to construct a three-dimensional model (3-D model) of the PRYSPRY domain of pyrin. The majority of the known MEFV mutations located on this domain have been classified, according to disease severity, and localized on this 3-D model. The functional consequences of these mutations and their implications on disease severity are discussed.

It is polymorphic with a number of different enzymes, all of which are in complete linkage disequilibrium, which suggests an insertion/deletion type of polymorphism. Using the method of Sanger, we have sequenced 1,102 bp of the cloned U6.2 fragment. Analysis of the sequence showed there was a long direct repeat of 121 bp and two long inverted repeats. The first was 19 bp long, and the second was a palindromic invert of 20 bp. Such repeats could promote recombination in this region and could have been involved in the suggested insertion/deletion event that created the polymorphism detected at locus DXS304. Long fragments were observed using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), but no length variations were seen. The sequence of U6.2 will be useful in developing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay for the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) detected at locus DXS304 which should assist with carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of the fragile X syndrome.</text></passage></document><document><id>1022</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome results from a missense mutation in the WW domain of the PQBP1 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Golabi, Ito, and Hall reported a family with X linked mental retardation (XLMR), microcephaly, postnatal growth deficiency, and other anomalies, including atrial septal defect, in 1984. METHODS: This family was restudied as part of our ongoing study of XLMR, but significant linkage to X chromosome markers could not be found. Extreme short stature and microcephaly as well as other new clinical findings were observed. Mutations in the polyglutamine tract binding protein 1 gene (PQBP1) have recently been reported in four XLMR disorders (Renpenning, Hamel cerebro-palato-cardiac, Sutherland-Haan, and Porteous syndromes) as well as in several other families. The clinical similarity of our family to these patients with mutations in PQBP1, particularly the presence of microcephaly, short stature, and atrial septal defect, prompted examination of this gene. RESULTS: A missense mutation in PQBP1 was identified which changed the conserved tyrosine residue in the WW domain at position 65 to a cysteine (p.Y65C). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first missense mutation identified in PQBP1 and the first mutation in the WW domain of the gene. The WW domain has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of transcription by interacting with the PPxY motif found in transcription factors. The p.Y65C mutation may affect the proper functioning of the PQBP1 protein as a transcriptional co-activator.</text></passage></document><document><id>1023</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Some Observations on the Haemolytic Action of Certain Quinine Salts on the Erythrocytes of Different Individuals and on the Resistance of newly formed Red Corpuscles to Haemolysis under the Influence of Distilled Water.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>220</offset></passage></document><document><id>1024</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular basis of metachromatic leukodystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>49</offset></passage></document><document><id>1025</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A genetic linkage map of 27 markers on human chromosome 21.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>We have constructed a genetic linkage map of the long arm of human chromosome 21 comprising 27 DNA markers.

Traditional methods (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) were used to map 25 of these markers, whereas 2 markers were studied by polymerase chain reaction amplification of (GT)n dinucleotide repeats. Linkage analysis was performed on 40 CEPH families using the computer program packages LINKAGE, CRI-MAP, and MAPMAKER. Recombination rates were significantly different between the sexes, with the male map being 132 cM and the female map being 161 cM, assuming Kosambi interference and a variable ratio of sex difference in recombination. Approximately one-half of the crossovers in either sex occur distally, in terminal band 21q22.3, which also contains 16 of the markers studied.

PHK consists of four different subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Although it is unknown whether liver and muscle PHK subunits are encoded by the same genes, the muscle alpha subunit (PHKA) gene was a likely candidate gene for the mutation responsible for this X-linked liver glycogenosis as it was assigned to the X chromosome at q12-q13. Linkage analysis with X-chromosomal polymorphic DNA markers was performed in two families segregating XLG. First, multipoint linkage analysis excluded the muscle PHKA region as the site of the XLG mutation. Second, evidence was obtained for linkage between the XLG locus and DXS197, DXS43, DXS16, and DXS9 with two-point peak lod scores Zmax = 6.64, 3.75, 1.30, and 0.88, all at theta max = 0.00, respectively.

Segregation data using these markers and 40 large multigenerational families supplied by the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain have been collected. Linkage analyses were performed with the program package CRI-MAP; using odds greater than 1000:1, 30 RFLP loci could be placed on the map. This genetic map spans 289 cM sex-equal, 353 cM in females, and 244 cM in males. While the relative rate of recombination for female meioses is nearly twice that of males over much of the chromosome, several instances of statistically significant excess male recombination were observed. The order of probes on the genetic map has been confirmed by their physical order as determined by somatic cell hybrid lines containing deletions of normal chromosome 5. There is concordance between the physical positions of markers and their genetic positions. Our most distal probes on the genetic map are cytologically localized to the most distal portions of the chromosome. This suggests that our genetic map spans most of chromosome 5.</text></passage></document><document><id>1028</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Muscle expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in different variants. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>Muscle expression of G6PD deficiency has been investigated in Mediterranean , Seattle-like and A-variants .

Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from the mouse using this cDNA as a probe indicates that there is only one mouse amelogenin (Amel) gene. This paper describes restriction site variation for the Amel gene that we have identified between C57BL/6 and M. spretus and the segregation of that variation as an X-chromosome gene. The position of the amelogenin locus (Amel) relative to the loci for alpha-galactosidase (Ags), proteolipoprotein (Plp), and the random genomic probe DXWas31 has been determined.

Heterozygous apc mutations have been identified in the majority of classical FAP patients who develop more than 100 colorectal adenomas. However, classical FAP patients often fail to display germline APC mutations detectable by routine mutation analysis. These apparently mutation-negative cases may be caused by heterozygous large genomic deletions. In the present study, FAP patients who showed no APC germline mutation detectable by the protein truncation assay and direct sequencing of protein coding exons were screened for APC gene deletion by a gene dose assay based on double competitive polymerase chain reaction. Gene dosage measurements within exon 15 of the APC gene identified two patients with gene deletion and one with possible gene duplication among 41 apparently mutation-negative patients. The deleted sequences in the two patients were determined by fine gene dose mapping around the APC gene and nucleotide sequencing of the deletion breakpoints. They were approximately 435-kilobase pair (kb) and 737-kb regions including the whole APC gene and flanked by a 4-base pair repeat and LINE-1 repetitive sequences, respectively. The chimeric LINE-1 element created at the breakpoint in the latter case also contained a short sequence derived from another LINE-1 element, suggesting a complex unequal homologous recombination event. These findings indicate that this gene dose assay is a useful technique to detect large gene deletions of the APC gene and to determine their genomic breakpoints.</text></passage></document><document><id>1033</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Epigenetic alterations of BRG1 leads to cancer development through its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling abnormalities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>116</offset><text>SWI/SNF is a multiprotein chromatin remodeling complex important for gene regulation. BRG1 and its close relative BRM, have ATPase activity necessary for transcriptional regulation by conformational change of nucleosomes. Due to this role on gene expression, several members of SWI/SNF complex including BRG1 and BRM function as a tumor suppressor or negative regulator of cellular proliferation. On the other hand, the shuttling of proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm is strongly involved in the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation. Many of tumor suppressor gene (TSG)s including p53, BRCA1, ING1 play some of their functions through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Abnormalities related with this process abrogate the subcellular localization of the TSGs and lead to cancer development. We recently demonstrated BRG1 as a TSG in oral cancer. Our analysis also revealed an interesting finding that one of the splicing forms of BRG1 is selectively lost in cancer tissue as compared to normal counterparts. Our further analysis revealed a putative nuclear retention signal domain for this splicing form. In this article, we speculate the possible mechanism for the inactivation of BRG1 gene in oral cancer through an abnormality in its subcellular localization.</text></passage></document><document><id>1034</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan disease in a 20-year- old man incorrectly described as developing 'cerebral palsy' after general anaesthesia in infancy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>133</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) enzyme.

Mutation analysis of the HPRT gene revealed a novel missense mutation, c.449T > G in exon 6 (p.V150G). Cascade testing of family members revealed that the mother was heterozygous for the mutation but two siblings (a brother and a sister) did not carry the sequence mutation.

Some of these visual disturbances may be attributable to either the disease process, or the anticonvulsant therapy prescribed to control the seizures.

Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the difference between controls and patients; moreover, Pearson's correlation test have been performed. Before the beginning of therapy, there were no differences in color vision and macular function between controls and epileptic patients.

At nyctometry, all patients showed no significant variation of macular function between baseline evaluation and second evaluation at end of the follow-up. Our study demonstrates that, in our group of epileptic patients, epilepsy per se does not affect color vision and retinal function.

METHODS: We present two new families with recurrent PITX2 intronic mutations and use PITX2c minigenes and transfected cells to address the hypothesis that intronic mutations effect RNA splicing. Three PITX2 mutations have been analyzed: a G>T mutation within the AG 3' splice site (ss) junction associated with exon 4 (IVS4-1G>T), a G>C mutation at position +5 of the 5' (ss) of exon 4 (IVS4+5G>C), and a previously reported A>G substitution at position -11 of 3'ss of exon 5 (IVS5-11A>G). RESULTS: Mutation IVS4+5G>C showed 71% retention of the intron between exons 4 and 5, and poorly expressed protein. Wild-type protein levels were proportionally expressed from correctly spliced mRNA. The G>T mutation within the exon 4 AG 3'ss junction shifted splicing exclusively to a new AG and resulted in a severely truncated, poorly expressed protein. Finally, the A>G substitution at position -11 of the 3'ss of exon 5 shifted splicing exclusively to a newly created upstream AG and resulted in generation of a protein with a truncated homeodomain. CONCLUSION: This is the first direct evidence to support aberrant RNA splicing as the mechanism underlying the disorder in some patients and suggests that the magnitude of the splicing defect may contribute to the variability of ARS phenotypes, in support of a gene dosage model of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.</text></passage></document><document><id>1040</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Two frequent missense mutations in Pendred syndrome. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early childhood deafness and goiter .

One missense mutation ( L236P ) was found in a homozygous state in two consanguineous families and in a heterozygous state in five additional non-consanguineous families . Another missense mutation ( T416P ) was found in a homozygous state in one family and in a heterozygous state in four families . Pendred patients in three non-consanguineous families were shown to be compound heterozygotes for L236P and T416P . In total , one or both of these mutations were found in nine of the 14 families analyzed .

The exons coding for the cysteine-rich region, which has been postulated to consist of 3 or 4 repeating elements, are not organised correspondingly. Transcription of the gene initiates from multiple sites which may be due to the absence of an upstream TATA box. The polyadenylation site is also heterogeneous.

Exons 2 of DRB1 and DRB5 of DR2-positive individuals were locus-specific amplified and hybridized with a number of different oligonucleotides capable of discriminating between the various Dw2, Dw12, Dw21, and Dw22 associated sequences. The linkage of DRB with DQA1 and DQB1 in these haplotypes was analyzed. Among the DR2- positive cells we could define 10 different DR DQ haplotypes by serology and 13 by oligonucleotide typing. The DR2.ES specificity is a serological DRw15 variant which could not be discriminated by oligonucleotide typing from a DRw15 DQw5 haplotype. The DR2.JA variant represents a unique DRB1*1602 DRB5*0101 haplotype. The DR1+2s haplotype consists of a DRB1 DQ region from a Dw1 and a DRB5 gene from a Dw2 haplotype. Its short DR2 serum pattern can be explained by the absence of a DR2 DRB1 gene product. DRB5*0101 sequences were found in association with DRB1*1501, *1502, *1602, and *0101 alleles. Since the DRB5 gene is capable of such different associations it is comparable to the DRB3 and DRB4 genes. This may have implications for the definition of the broad DR2 specificity which is predominantly encoded by the DRB5 gene product. New DR2 haplotypes included the following DQ combinations: DQw2-positive DQA1/B1*0301/0201 and DQw6-positive DQA1/B1*0102/0601 and *0102/0603 haplotypes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1043</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular and clinical overlap of Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome phenotypes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>The Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndromes (AS) share the same apparent cytogenetic and molecular lesions of 15q11-13 and yet exhibit distinct clinical phenotypes. The etiology of PWS or AS appears to depend on the parental origin of the aberrant chromosome 15. Substantial clinical overlap has not been reported between deletion-positive PWS and AS patients. In the present study, we report the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular findings in three AS patients. The first patient is a mentally retarded woman with a visible deletion of 15q11-13 with typical craniofacial, behavioral, and neurologic changes of AS. This patient is hyperphagic, and she is moderately obese for her height. Her hands and feet are small. These manifestations are more characteristic of PWS and not of AS. The molecular studies showed deletions of maternal origin for five distal PWCR loci. The most proximal locus, D15S18, was not deleted. These findings are identical to those found in our third AS patient who does not have any PWS features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrence of hyperphagia with consequent obesity and the AS phenotype in a patient with a del 15(q11-13) of maternal origin. These clinical findings suggest that overlap in the symptoms of PWS and AS can occur. Our second AS patient presents with atypical molecular findings in that he cannot be classed into any of the three proposed sub-groups of AS patients and may be representative of a fourth sub-group of AS patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1044</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Linkage exclusion between the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease locus and chromosome 16 markers in a new family.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>A family segregating for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is reported. The clinical picture was typical for ADPKD in some family members, although others showed mild involvement. DNA from family members was probed with seven chromosome 16 single-copy DNA sequences that mapped to the telomere of the short arm of the chromosome. The most likely order of six of the probes from the telomere is palpha3'HVR.64 at the designated locus D16S85, CRI-0327 at D16S63, CRI-090 at D16S45, CRI-0129 at D16S56, CRI-0133 at D16S58, and CRI-0136 at D16S60, with the PKD1 locus for ADPKD between D16S85 and D16S63. The seventh probe 24-1 at D16S80 had not been ordered in relation to the other sequences, but PKD1 had been mapped between it and D16S85. The three probes that were informative in our family, palpha3'HVR.64, CRI-090, and CRI-0136 had been linked to the disease locus at recombination frequencies of 4% and approximately 6 and 12%, respectively. Linkage was excluded between the ADPKD locus in our family and palpha3'HVR.64 at a recombination value of up to 6%. Linkage was also excluded between CRI-090 and the disease locus at a recombination value of up to 5%. The data for linkage between CRI-0136 and the ADPKD locus in our family were inconclusive. Multipoint analysis excluded the possibility that the disease in this family lies between the flanking genetic markers that have previously been used to define the genetic interval in which the most common form of polycystic kidney disease, PKD1, lies. We have not made a positive assignment of the ADPKD mutation in this family.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</text></passage></document><document><id>1045</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Improved synthesis of [1-14C]acyl-sphingosine-galactose-3-sulfate (sulfatide) for diagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy: usefulness of radioscanning.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>154</offset><text>We report an improved method for the radiolabelling of [1-14C 00acyl-sphingosine-galactose-3-sulfate (sulfatide), requiring preparation of lysosulfatide (sulfogalactosyl-sphingosine) by alkaline hydrolysis of sulfatide and reacylation of the sphingosine amino group with a [1-14C]stearoyl chloride.

On the basis of comparative mapping studies and on phenotypic similarities, Sey has been suggested to be homologous to congenital aniridia (lack of iris) in human. A candidate gene for the aniridia (AN) locus at 11p13 has been isolated by positional cloning and its sequence and that of the mouse homologue has been established (C.T., manuscript in preparation). This gene belongs to the paired-like class of developmental genes first described in Drosophila which contain two highly conserved motifs, the paired box and the homeobox. In vertebrates, genes which encode the single paired domain as well as those which express both motifs have been described as the Pax multigene family. A Pax gene recently described as Pax-6 is identical to the mouse homologue of the candidate aniridia gene. Here we report the analysis of three independent Sey alleles and show that indeed this gene is mutated and that the mutations would predictably interrupt gene function.</text></passage></document><document><id>1048</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations and assessment of mutation spectrum and prevalence in Italian breast and/or ovarian cancer families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>142</offset><text>Familial aggregations of breast/ovarian cancer cases frequently depend on BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations.

The mdx mice also showed negative dystrophin staining. In Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), muscle fibers stained in a patchy or discontinuous fashion. Two symptomatic DMD carriers exhibited a distinct mosaic pattern of dystrophin positive and negative fibers.

ATM, the gene mutated in the disorder, ataxia-telangiectasia, is a protein kinase that is a central mediator of responses to DNA double-strand breaks in cells. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanism by which DNA damage activates the ATM kinase and initiates these critical cellular signaling pathways. The SMC1 protein appears to be a particularly important target of the ATM kinase, playing critical roles in controlling DNA replication forks and DNA repair after the damage. A major role for the NBS1 and BRCA1 proteins appears to be in the recruitment of an activated ATM kinase molecule to the sites of DNA breaks so that ATM can phosphorylate SMC1. Generation of mice and cells that are unable to phosphorylate SMC1 demonstrated the importance of SMC1 phosphorylation in the DNA-damage-induced S-phase checkpoint, in determining rates of repair of chromosomal breaks, and in determining cell survival after DNA damage. Focusing on ATM and SMC1, the molecular controls of these pathways is discussed.</text></passage></document><document><id>1054</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nonsense mutation of feline beta-hexosaminidase beta-subunit (HEXB) gene causing Sandhoff disease in a family of Japanese domestic cats.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>137</offset><text>G(M2) gangliosidoses are inherited metabolic disorders and are caused by severely reduced enzymatic activity of lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase.

The patient has subsequently been studied for 22 years (1952 to 1974). His serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been consistently and excessively high despite efforts to regulate them by means of diet or diet and drugs. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration ranged from 1,400 to 3,400 mg/dl compared with a normal value of 156 plus or minus 92 mg/dl. The metabolism of lipoproteins, judged by vitamin A turnover studies was slow. Peripheral atherosclerosis became evident 15 years after beginning the study whereas cinecoronary arteriography concurrently demonstrated only minimum changes. Xanthomas exhibited marked regression only during the last 6 years, after 16 years of diet and the addition of clofibrate for 7 years. Beta lipoprotein and IgA globulin determined by immunofluorescent and immunoelectrophoretic technics were demonstrated in the atherosclerotic material obtained from the patient's arterial wall. They were also found in the plasma cells of the bone marrow. The IgA globulin-beta lipoprotein complex in the serum was broken with difficulty. The patient's isolated IgA globulin, free of lipoprotein, formed a firm complex when mixed with beta lipoprotein prepared from normal human serum. Initially, IgA globulin studies showed presence of both kappa and lambda light chains in normal proportion. But after 18 years, the IgA globulin has become monoclonal, type lambda. The plasma cells of the bone marrow have become progressively more atypical and immature. No clinical indications of multiple myeloma have been found. It is concluded that association of lipoproteins with IgA globulin in the serum of this patient with hyperlipidemia, hyper-IgA globulinemia did not prevent the development of atherosclerotic lesions and the deposition of lipids and lipoproteins in the plaques. It is possible that the lipoprotein-immunoglobulin association may have retarded the process, since it became manifest only after many years of known hyperlipidemia.</text></passage></document><document><id>1056</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular and phenotypic characteristics of patients with phenylketonuria in Serbia and Montenegro.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism in Caucasians.

We demonstrate here that elimination of GM2 ganglioside (GM2) accumulated in the fibroblastic cell line derived from SD mice (FSD) did not occur when the HEXB gene only was transfected. In contrast, a significant increase in the HexB (betabeta homodimer) activity toward neutral substrates, including GA2 (asialo-GM2) and oligosaccharides carrying the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues at their non-reducing ends (GlcNAc-oligosaccharides) was observed. Immunoblotting with anti-human HexA (alphabeta heterodimer) serum after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Native-PAGE) revealed that the human HEXB gene product could hardly form the chimeric HexA through associating with the murine alpha-subunit. However, co-introduction of the HEXA encoding the human alpha-subunit and HEXB genes caused significant corrective effect on the GM2 degradation by producing the human HexA. These results indicate that the recombinant human HexA could interspeciesly associate with the murine GM2 activator protein to degrade GM2 accumulated in the FSD cells. Thus, therapeutic effects of the recombinant human HexA isozyme but not human HEXB gene product could be evaluated by using the SD mice.</text></passage></document><document><id>1059</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Disequilibrium linkage between the polymorphism in exons 2, 3 and 4 of the MICA gene and HLA-B antigen of patient with ankylosing spondylitis].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>145</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the exons 2 to 4 of the MICA gene and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: By PCR-SSOP, DNA samples from 56 AS patients and 112 random healthy individuals, as normal control were genotyped to analyse the polymorphism in exons 2, 3, 4 of the MICA alleles. RESULTS: MICA*008 was dominant in MICA allele,accounted for 32.14% and 30.36% in AS patients and normal controls respectively. The frequency of MICA*007 was significantly increased in AS patients, when compared with normal controls (chi-square=10.18, P&lt;0.05, RR=2.50). No difference was found in the other MICA alleles. The haplotype analysis revealed that there were the strong linkage disequilibrium between MICA and HLA-B of AS patients, and normal controls. There was a difference in MICA*007-B27 between two groups (chi-square=18.46, P&lt;0.05, RR=7.47). Both HLA-B27 and MICA*007 were strongly associated with AS. Stratified analysis showed that HLA-B27 was significantly relative to AS,while it was not found between MICA*007 and AS. CONCLUSION: The increased frequency of MICA alleles may be due to its strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B27.</text></passage></document><document><id>1060</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Is there a higher incidence of maternal uniparental disomy 14 [upd(14)mat]?

Patients with upd(14)mat show features overlapping with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and are probably underdiagnosed. Maternal upd(14) is frequently described in carriers of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14, but is also found in patients with a normal karyotype. Based on the above mentioned criteria we have identified six patients with upd(14)mat including two patients with a normal karyotype, one patient with a de novo Robertsonian translocation (14;21), one patient with a familial Robertsonian translocation (13;14) and two patients with a marker chromosome. In addition, we analyzed a cohort of 33 patients with low birth weight, feeding difficulties and consecutive obesity in whom PWS had been excluded by methylation analysis of SNRPN. In four of these patients (12%) we detected upd(14)mat. For rapid testing of upd(14)mat we analyzed the methylation status of the imprinted MEG3 locus. In conclusion, we recommend considering upd(14)mat in patients with low birth weight, growth retardation, neonatal feeding problems, muscular hypotonia, motor delay, precocious puberty and truncal obesity as well as in patients with a PWS like phenotype presenting with low birth weight, feeding difficulties and obesity.</text></passage></document><document><id>1061</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Study of inheritance of diabetes mellitus in Western Indian population by pedigree analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: To study the inheritance pattern of diabetes mellitus in Western Indian population by analysing the pedigree of diabetes patients. METHODS: 3,921 individuals from 300 families were interviewed for family history in this study, out of which 770 were diabetic individuals. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using T-test and Chi-square test. RESULTS: 37% cases of Type 1 DM and 58% cases of Type 2 DM showed family history of the disease. Of the cases showing family history for diabetes, 92% in case of Type 1 DM and 59% in case of Type 2 DM showed family history of Type 2 DM with a decrease in age of onset in the successive generations. Both the parents, when diabetic conferred equal risk of inheriting diabetes in offspring. The sex ratio of offspring suffering from diabetes was not influenced when only one of the parents was diabetic. However it was observed that the male offspring were highly susceptible when both parents were diabetic (Chi-square value=4.55 with 1 d.f.). The age of onset of diabetes did not show significant correlation with whether one or both the parents were diabetic. However, it was noteworthy that in case of familial history of diabetes there was a decrease in the age of onset in successive generations. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that family history of diabetes results in predisposition to early onset of the disease in successive generations and a cluster of genes involved in Type 2 DM may show a parental effect for predisposition to Type 1 DM in the offspring in this set of Indian population.</text></passage></document><document><id>1062</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The B  rjeson-Forssman-Lehman syndrome (BFLS, MIM #301900).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>B  rjeson-Forssman-Lehman syndrome was first described in 1962.

METHODS: Two families with a retinal dystrophy were extensively phenotyped and blood was taken for mutation analysis of the RDS (all) and ROM1 (retinitis pigmentosa patients only) genes. RESULTS: A novel p.Trp94X mutation in RDS was found in all three affected members of a two-generation family that was associated with retinitis pigmentosa in the son, pattern dystrophy in the daughter and fundus flavimaculatus in the mother. In the second family, the proband with retinitis pigmentosa carried a p.Arg220Trp mutation. The mother, who was unavailable for mutation screening, had adult vitelliform macular dystrophy. No ROM1 mutations were found in those with retinitis pigmentosa in either family. CONCLUSION: Mutations in RDS can be associated with an intrafamilial variation in retinal disease. The phenotypes range from Stargardt-like macular dystrophy to classic retinitis pigmentosa. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Intrafamilial phenotypic variation may be due to the presence of environmental or genetic modifying factors. The presence of a modifying-sequence change in the coding region of ROM1 for two people with retinitis pigmentosa from two families with intrafamilial variation in RDS mutation phenotype has been excluded in this study.</text></passage></document><document><id>1064</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of cytokine responses to retinal detachment in rats.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>PURPOSE: Photoreceptor apoptosis is associated with retinal detachment (RD) induced photoreceptor degeneration. Previously, we demonstrated the importance of caspase activation for RD-induced photoreceptor death in a rat model of RD. However, extracellular signals that precede the activation of caspases and photoreceptor degeneration remain unclear. The aim of this study is to characterize the molecular and cellular responses that occur after RD. The expression of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were examined in a rat model of RD. METHODS: RD was induced in adult rats by subretinal injection of sodium hyaluronate. Retinal tissues were collected at various times (1, 3, 6, 24, and 72 h) after the induction of detachment. To screen for expressional changes in response to RD, major candidates for cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were broadly examined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). To identify the cellular sources of the expressed genes, cells from various layers of the retina were obtained using laser capture microdissection (LCM), and their mRNAs were isolated. Protein expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry and Enzyme Linked-Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA). To assess the potential of early response genes after RD to induce photoreceptor degeneration, exogenous recombinant proteins were subretinally injected and the photoreceptor cell death was assessed using a TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay at 24 h after RD. RESULTS: At 72 h after RD a significant increase in mRNA levels for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were detected in the neural retina. LCM revealed increased expression of mRNA for bFGF and MCP-1 in all retinal layers, though bFGF was especially evident in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and MCP-1 in the inner nuclear layer (INL). TNF-alpha was increased in the ONL and the INL, and IL-1beta was increased in the ganglion cell layer. Time course experiments showed that TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and MCP-1 increased within 1 h after RD, while bFGF was increased by 24 h. Increased protein expression for TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and MCP-1 was demonstrated by ELISA at 6 h after RD. Immunohistochemistry showed TNF-alpha and bFGF expression in the whole retina, with IL-1beta specifically expressed in astrocytes and MCP-1 in M  ller cells. Subretinal administration of MCP-1 significantly increased TUNEL-positive cells in the ONL 24 h after RD, while injection of vehicle control, TNF-alpha, or IL-1beta showed no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal glial cells, including astrocytes and M  ller cells, are a major source of cytokine induction after RD. The increased expression and release of MCP-1 may be an important cause of photoreceptor degeneration associated with RD. This study helps to understand the mechanisms of RD-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Our results may provide new therapeutic targets to prevent photoreceptor degeneration following RD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1065</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular and genetic aspects of DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>Cytogenetic, molecular, and clinical genetic studies have contributed to our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). Submicroscopic deletions of chromosome 22ql 1.2 are the leading cause of both of these disorders. The 22q 11.2 deletion syndrome is recognized as one of the most common microdeletion syndromes. The clini'cal features are highly variable and include a variety of congenital anomalies, medical problems, and cognitive and neuropsychological difficulties. Infrequently, other chromosomal rearrangements are found in patients with DGS/VCFS, and, rarely, point mutations in the gene TBX1, a transcription factor, that maps to the deleted region. The most sensitive and widely used diagnostic test for detecting the 22ql 1.2 deletion is fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes from the commonly deleted region. Alternatively, polymerase chain reaction can be performed to confirm failure to inherit a parental allele in the region or to determine copy number. Prenatal diagnosis is also available, particularly when a conotruncal cardiac defect is identified during a pregnancy or when a parent carries a deletion. Genetic counseling is recommended before testing to review the natural history of the disorder, testing options, and test sensitivity and limitations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1066</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Factor H, a regulator of complement activity, is a major determinant of meningococcal disease susceptibility in UK Caucasian patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>135</offset><text>Defence against Neisseria meningitidis involves complement-mediated bactericidal activity.

A putatively functional single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) exists within a presumed nuclear-factor-kappa-B responsive element (NF-kB) in the fH gene (C-496T). Genetic and functional investigations were carried out to determine whether C-496T has a role in meningococcal disease (MD) susceptibility. Genetic susceptibility was investigated in 2 independent studies, a case-control and family-based transmission-disequilibrium-test (TDT), using 2 separate cohorts of UK Caucasian patients. MD susceptibility was both genetically associated with the C/C homozygous genotype (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 - 3.2, p = 0.001) and linked to the C allele (p = 0.04), the association being most significant in serogroup C infected patients (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.6 - 5.5, p = 0.0002). FH serum concentrations were also associated with C-496T genotype, with highest fH concentrations in C/C homozygous individuals (p = 0.01). Functional studies showed NF-kappa-B binding to the C-496T-containing region and that pre-incubation of fH with meningococci reduced bactericidal activity and increased meningococci B and C survival in blood. This study shows that C-496T is both associated and linked with MD and that individuals possessing the fH C-496T C/C genotype are more likely to have increased serum fH protein levels, have reduced bactericidal activity against meningococci and be at an increased risk of contracting MD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1067</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation analysis of PAH gene and characterization of a recurrent deletion mutation in Korean patients with phenylketonuria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>Phenylketonuria (PKU; MIM 261600) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; EC 1.14.16.1). Point mutations in the PAH gene are known to cause PKU in various ethnic groups, and large deletions or duplications account for up to 3% of the PAH mutations in some ethnic groups. However, a previous study could not identify approximately 14% of the mutant alleles by sequence analysis in Korean patients with PKU, which suggests that large deletions or duplication might be frequent causes of PKU in Koreans. To test this hypothesis, we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for the identification of uncharacterized mutant alleles after PAH sequence analysis of 33 unrelated Korean patients with PKU. Bi-directional sequencing of the PAH exons and flanking intronic regions revealed 27 different mutations, including four novel mutations (two missense and two deletion mutations), comprising 57/66 (86%) mutant alleles. MLPA identified a large deletion that encompassed exons 5 and 6 in four patients, another large deletion that extended from exon 4 to exon 7 in one patient, and a duplication of exon 4 in one patient. Chromosomal walking characterized the deletion breakpoint of the most common large deletion that involved exons 5 and 6 (c.456_706+138del). The present study shows that the allelic frequency of exon deletion or duplication is 9% (6/66) in Korean PKU patients, which suggests that these mutations may be frequent causes of PKU in Korean subjects.</text></passage></document><document><id>1068</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Early development of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>Thirty-three boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and a mean age of 3.4 years were assessed with the Griffiths Developmental Scales, the Reynell Language Scales and the British Picture Vocabulary Scales at six-monthly intervals over a one-year period.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) and germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are found in the majority of HNPCC families and provide an opportunity for genetic diagnosis and prophylactic screening. The MMR gene mutation spectrum may vary across different populations and be influenced by founder mutations that prevail in specific ethnic groups. China is a big and ancient nation with enormous genetic diversity, which is especially notable between the northern and southern Chinese populations. A MMR gene mutation database for the southern Chinese population based in Hong Kong has been previously established. This study compares the MMR gene mutation spectrum and the MSI of HNPCC between the northern and southern Chinese populations. METHODS: Twenty-five HNPCC families from northern China were systematically analyzed. The MSI analysis was performed using five loci in the USA National Cancer Institute (NCI) panel (D2S123, D5S346, BAT-25, BAT-26 and BAT-40) by PCR from the tumor and normal tissue. MSH2, MSH6 and MLH1 were performed using immunohistochemical staining. Two founder mutations of MSH2 and MLH1 were examined by PCR base analyses using primers flanking the two deletion sites (c.1452_1455delAATG in MSH2 and 1.8 kb deletion involving exon 11 of MLH1). RESULTS: Of the 25 families collected, 19 met Bethesda guideline (BG) 1 and six met BG3. Twenty-two (15.7%) were extra-colonic cancers with gastric cancer (in seven patients) being the most common cancer type. Of the 25 tumors analyzed, 21 (84%) were high level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and four (16%) were microsatellite stable (MSS). Eighteen (86%) of the 21 MSI-H tumors showed loss of either the MLH1 or the MSH2 protein. Three MSI-H tumors and all four MSS tumors showed no loss of expression of the three MMR proteins. Out of the 21 patients with MSI-H tumors, 12 (57%) showed pathogenic germline mutations in either MLH1 (n = 8) or MSH2 (n = 4). Overall, three novel mutations (in patients H22, H17 and H29) have been identified. One of them, c.503_4insA, caused a frameshift mutation in the MLH1 gene. The other two were found in the MSH2 gene, including a frameshift (c.899_890insAT) and a splice junction (IVS7-1G-->A, SA of Exon 8) mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a distinctly different mutation spectrum of MMR genes between northern and southern Chinese populations and call for a systematic, nationwide study to facilitate the design of a MMR gene mutation detection strategy tailored for individual populations in China.</text></passage></document><document><id>1074</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Complement C7 deficiency: seven further molecular defects and their associated marker haplotypes. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset><text>Seven further molecular bases of C7 deficiency are described .

We present a patient diagnosed 8 weeks postpartum. The female patient presented in the first 3 days after birth with agitation, choking, and vomiting. Six weeks later, the patient presented again with vomiting and insufficient weight gain. Metabolic screening of urine showed a strongly increased excretion of uracil and thymine, with no other abnormalities.

This study investigates the pathological characteristics of 4 patients (3 with von Hippel-Lindau [VHL] disease and 1 with a vasoproliferative retinal tumor) who underwent ocular tumor resection. von Hippel-Lindau is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a defect of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. The VHL protein is required for oxygen-dependent degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha. This factor regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Retinal hemangioblastoma is the most common tumor observed in VHL disease. We investigated the expression of CXCR4; its ligand, CXCL12/SDF-1alpha; VEGF; and the VHL gene in VHL disease-associated retinal hemangioblastomas. DESIGN: Interventional case series with immunohistological and molecular pathological analyses. PARTICIPANTS: Immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology of the surgically excised retinal lesions were performed. INTERVENTION: Large retinal hemangioblastomas (1-3 disc diameters) and vasoproliferative tumors were resected surgically after laser photocoagulation in 4 patients. The excised tissues were snap frozen and evaluated by histology. Molecular pathology was performed for the VHL gene, and immunohistochemistry and molecular detection (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) were carried out for VEGF, CXCR4, and CXCL12. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation of clinical presentations and molecular pathology of the excised retinal lesions. RESULTS: Large retinal hemangioblastomas were resected successfully from the 3 VHL cases. Postoperatively, all patients were stable. Molecular analyses disclosed the loss of heterozygosity at the VHL allele locus in the VHL retinal hemangioblastomas but not in the vasoproliferative tumor. High levels of transcript and protein were found for VEGF and CXCR4, whereas low levels of CXCL12 mRNA were expressed in the retinal hemangioblastomas associated with VHL disease. In contrast, very low levels of VEGF and CXCR4 mRNA were detected in the vasoproliferative tumor. Furthermore, increased expression of VEGF and CXCR4 was detected in more active hemangioblastomas. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection of large retinal hemangioblastomas may be useful for therapy in selected VHL patients. Activated VHL lesions produce more VEGF. This is the first demonstration of CXCR4 expression in VHL disease-associated retinal hemangioblastomas. We suggest targeting CXCR4 as an additional therapeutic strategy for VHL disease-associated retinal hemangioblastomas.</text></passage></document><document><id>1077</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Distribution of cytoplasmic vacuoles in blood T and B lymphocytes in two lysosomal disorders.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Distribution of cytoplasmic vacuoles in purified T and B lymphocytes was analyzed in four cases of aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) and in one case of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Spielmeyer-Sj  rgren type).

Mortality results primarily from muscle wasting and cardiac arrhythmias. There are two forms of the disease: DM1 and DM2. DM1, which constitutes 98% of cases, is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the DMPK gene. DM2 is caused by a CCTG expansion in the first intron of the ZNF9 gene. RNA containing CUG- or CCUG-expanded repeats are transcribed but are retained in the nucleus in foci. Disease pathogenesis results primarily from a gain of function of the expanded RNAs, which alter developmentally regulated alternative splicing as well as pathways of muscle differentiation. The toxic RNA has been implicated in sequestration of splicing regulators and transcription factors thereby causing specific symptoms of the disease. Here we review the proposed mechanisms for the toxic effects of the expanded repeats and discuss the molecular mechanisms of splicing misregulation and disease pathogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1079</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The M694V variant of the familial Mediterranean fever gene is associated with sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease in an Italian population sample.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>152</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Inflammation is deemed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to determine whether the proinflammatory M694V mutation of pyrin, the gene responsible for familial Mediterranean fever, could lead to an increased risk for AD. METHODS: We compared the M694V variant genotypes in 378 sporadic AD patients and 384 healthy control subjects of Italian descent. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, the M694V mutation was found to be associated with an increased risk for AD in subjects with an age at onset of 65 years or younger (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio, OR: 3.01, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.24-6.72, p = 0.021), but not in patients with an age at onset older than 65 years (multivariate-adjusted OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.34-1.99, p = 0.847). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that AD patients bearing the M694V mutation presented with disease onset 7 years earlier than carriers of the wild-type genotype (log rank = 41.61, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the M694V sequence variant in the pyrin gene might influence the age at onset of AD in the Italian population.</text></passage></document><document><id>1080</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutational analysis of RPGR and RP2 genes in Japanese patients with retinitis pigmentosa: identification of four mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>PURPOSE: To identify mutations in RPGR and RP2 genes in a series of Japanese retinitis pigmentosa (RP) families and to determine the association between the phenotypic changes in patients/carriers and the mutations. METHODS: A total of 37 unrelated RP families were recruited, three of which were with typical X-linked RP (XLRP), and other 34 families included 29 multiplex families and 5 simplex RP cases with no family history of RP. In addition, At least one RP patient had myopia >-3.0D in these families. RPGR and RP2 genes were comprehensively screened by using the direct polymerase chain reaction-sequencing method. Detailed phenotypes of the families with confirmed mutations were assessed by routine ophthalmic examinations, Goldmann perimetry, electroretinography and color fundus photography. RESULTS: Four mutations in RPGR and RP2 genes were identified. Of the three XLRP families, one had an ORF15 mutation and another had an RP2 mutation. Two ORF15 mutations were found in three of the other 34 RP families, with two families sharing a same mutation, g.ORF15+652-653delAG. All the three ORF15 mutations were first reported in the Japanese population. Affected males showed relatively severe symptoms while female carriers showed a wide spectrum of severity. A tapetal-like reflex was observed in two young females, indicating clinically the carrier status. CONCLUSIONS: We identified three ORF15 mutations and one RP2 mutation in five Japanese RP families. Moderate or severe myopia might be an indicator for the XLRP status in multiplex RP families which pedigree data are insufficient to allow accurate subtyping. It is suggested that mutational analysis of RPGR and RP2 may help to identify the causative mutation in a proportion of multiplex RP patients with myopia.</text></passage></document><document><id>1081</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Partial cure of established disease in an animal model of metachromatic leukodystrophy after intracerebral adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>154</offset><text>Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by genetic deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA) enzyme. Failure in catalyzing the degradation of its major substrate, sulfatide (Sulf), in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells leads to severe demyelination in the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS), and early death of MLD patients. The ARSA knockout mice develop a disease that resembles MLD but is milder, without significant demyelination in the PNS and CNS. We showed that adeno-associated virus serotype 5-mediated gene transfer in the brain of ARSA knockout mice reverses Sulf storage and prevents neuropathological abnormalities and neuromotor disabilities when vector injections are performed at a pre-symptomatic stage of disease. Direct injection of viral particles into the brain of ARSA knockout mice at a symptomatic stage results in sustained expression of ARSA, prevention of Sulf storage and neuropathological abnormalities. Despite these significant corrections, the treated mice continue to develop neuromotor disability. We show that more subtle biochemical abnormalities involving gangliosides and galactocerebroside are in fact not corrected.</text></passage></document><document><id>1082</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of cDNAs of the proto-oncogene c-src: heterogeneity in 5' exons and possible mechanism for the genesis of the 3' end of v-src.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>To further characterize the gene structure of the proto-oncogene c-src and the mechanism for the genesis of the v-src sequence in Rous sarcoma virus, we have analyzed genomic and cDNA copies of the chicken c-src gene. From a cDNA library of chicken embryo fibroblasts, we isolated and sequenced several overlapping cDNA clones covering the full length of the 4-kb c-src mRNA. The cDNA sequence contains a 1.84-kb sequence downstream from the 1.6-kb pp60c-src coding region. An open reading frame of 217 amino acids, called sdr (src downstream region), was found 105 nucleotides from the termination codon for pp60c-src. Within the 3' noncoding region, a 39-bp sequence corresponding to the 3' end of the RSV v-src was detected 660 bases downstream of the pp60c-src termination codon. The presence of this sequence in the c-src mRNA exon supports a model involving an RNA intermediate during transduction of the c-src sequence. The 5' region of the c-src cDNA was determined by analyzing several cDNA clones generated by conventional cloning methods and by polymerase chain reaction. Sequences of these chicken embryo fibroblast clones plus two c-src cDNA clones isolated from a brain cDNA library show that there is considerable heterogeneity in sequences upstream from the c-src coding sequence. Within this region, which contains at least 300 nucleotides upstream of the translational initiation site in exon 2, there exist at least two exons in each cDNA which fall into five cDNA classes. Four unique 5' exon sequences, designated exons UE1, UE2, UEX, and UEY, were observed. All of them are spliced to the previously characterized c-src exons 1 and 2 with the exception of type 2 cDNA. In type 2, the exon 1 is spliced to a novel downstream exon, designated exon 1a, which maps in the region of the c-src DNA defined previously as intron 1. Exon UE1 is rich in G+C content and is mapped at 7.8 kb upstream from exon 1. This exon is also present in the two cDNA clones from the brain cDNA library. Exon UE2 is located at 8.5 kb upstream from exon 1. The precise locations of exons UEX and UEY have not been determined, but both are more than 12 kb upstream from exon 1. The existence and exon arrangements of these 5' cDNAs were further confirmed by RNase protection assays and polymerase chain reactions using specific primers. Our findings indicate that the heterogeneity in the 5' sequences of the c-src mRNAs results from differential splicing and perhaps use of distinct initiation sites. All of these RNAs have the potential of coding for pp60c-src, since their 5' exons are all eventually joined to exon 2.</text></passage></document><document><id>1083</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PLP overexpression perturbs myelin protein composition and myelination in a mouse model of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>Duplication of PLP1, an X-linked gene encoding the major myelin membrane protein of the human CNS, is the most frequent cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). Transgenic mice with extra copies of the wild type Plp1 gene, a valid model of PMD, also develop a dysmyelinating phenotype dependant on gene dosage. In this study we have examined the effect of increasing Plp1 gene dosage on levels of PLP/DM20 and on other representative myelin proteins. In cultured oligodendrocytes and early myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo, increased gene dosage leads to elevated levels of PLP/DM20 in the cell body. During myelination, small increases in Plp1 gene dosage (mice hemizygous for the transgene) elevate the level of PLP/DM20 in oligodendrocyte soma but cause only minimal and transient effects on the protein composition and structure of myelin suggesting that cells can regulate the incorporation of proteins into myelin. However, larger increases in dosage (mice homozygous for the transgene) are not well tolerated, leading to hypomyelination and alteration in the cellular distribution of PLP/DM20. A disproportionate amount of PLP/DM20 is retained in the cell soma, probably in autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes whereas the level in myelin is reduced. Increased Plp1 gene dosage affects other myelin proteins, particularly MBP, which is transitorily reduced in hemizygous mice but consistently and markedly lower in homozygotes in both myelin and na  ve or early myelinating oligodendrocytes. Whether the reduced MBP is implicated in the pathogenesis of dysmyelination is yet to be established.</text></passage></document><document><id>1084</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Late presentation of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is the commonest disorder of fatty acid metabolism, with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality at presentation.

Compared with controls, homozygotes and heterozygotes had lower LCAT masses (-77% and -13%), and LCAT activities (-99% and -39%), respectively. In homozygotes, the majority of apoA-I was found in small, disc-shaped, poorly lipidated prebeta-1 and alpha-4 HDL particles, and some apoA-I was found in larger, lipid-poor, discoidal HDL particles with alpha-mobility. No apoC-I-containing HDL was noted, and all apoA-II and apoC-III was detected in lipid-poor, prebeta-mobility particles. ApoE-containing particles were more disperse than normal. ApoA-IV-containing particles were normal. Heterozygotes had profiles similar to controls, except that apoC-III was found only in small HDL with prebeta-mobility. Our data are consistent with the concepts that LCAT activity: 1) is essential for developing large, spherical, apoA-I-containing HDL and for the formation of normal-sized apoC-I and apoC-III HDL; and 2) has little affect on the conversion of prebeta-1 into alpha-4 HDL, only slight effects on apoE HDL, and no effect on apoA-IV HDL particles.</text></passage></document><document><id>1089</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A 7 Mb region within 11q13 may contain a high penetrance gene for breast cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>Familial breast cancer represents up to 5% of all breast cancer cases.

Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, caused by 15q11-q13 deletions or abnormal methylation of imprinted genes, are also associated with ASD. However, the prevalence of these disorders in ASD is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of 15q11-q13 rearrangements in a large sample of patients ascertained for ASD. METHODS: A total of 522 patients belonging to 430 families were screened for deletions, duplications, and methylation abnormalities involving 15q11-q13 with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). RESULTS: We identified four patients with 15q11-q13 abnormalities: a supernumerary chromosome 15, a paternal interstitial duplication, and two subjects with Angelman syndrome, one with a maternal deletion and the other with a paternal uniparental disomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that abnormalities of the 15q11-q13 region are a significant cause of ASD, accounting for approximately 1% of cases. Maternal interstitial 15q11-q13 duplications, previously reported to be present in 1% of patients with ASD, were not detected in our sample. Although paternal duplications of chromosome 15 remain phenotypically silent in the majority of patients, they can give rise to developmental delay and ASD in some subjects, suggesting that paternally expressed genes in this region can contribute to ASD, albeit with reduced penetrance compared with maternal duplications. These findings indicate that patients with ASD should be routinely screened for 15q genomic imbalances and methylation abnormalities and that MLPA is a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective method to perform this screening.</text></passage></document><document><id>1092</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Is the CD14 C159T polymorphism effective in the development of secondary amyloidosis in Familial Mediterranean fever?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>The most important complication of FMF is the development of amyloidosis.

KIT mutations in GIST are clustered in four exons. Most common are exon 11 (juxtamembrane domain) mutations that include deletions, point mutations (affecting a few codons), and duplications (mostly in the 3' region). The latter mutations most often occur in gastric GISTs. Among gastric GISTs, tumors with deletions are more aggressive than those with point mutations; this does not seem to hold true in small intestinal GISTs. Exon 9 mutations (5-10%) usually are 2-codon 502-503 duplications, and these occur predominantly in intestinal versus gastric GISTs. Lesser imatinib sensitivity of these tumors has been noted. Kinase domain mutations are very rare; GISTs with such mutations are variably sensitive to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations usually occur in gastric GISTs, especially in the epithelioid variants; their overall frequency is approximately 30% to 40% of KIT mutation negative GISTs. Most common is exon 18 mutation leading Asp842Val at the protein level. This mutation causes imatinib resistance. Exon 12 and 14 mutations are rare. Most mutations are somatic (in tumor tissue only), but patients with familial GIST syndrome have consitutitonal KIT/PDGFRA mutations; >10 families have been reported worldwide with mutations generally similar to those in sporadic GISTs. GISTs in neurofibromatosis 1 patients, children, and Carney triad seem to lack GIST-specific KIT and PDGFRA mutations and may have a different disease mechanism. Secondary mutations usually occur in KIT kinase domains in patients after imatinib treatment resulting in resistance to this drug. Mutation genotyping is a tool in GIST diagnosis and in assessment of sensitivity to kinase inhibitors. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.</text></passage></document><document><id>1094</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>c-kit expression by CD34+ bone marrow progenitors and inhibition of response to recombinant human interleukin-3 following exposure to c-kit antisense oligonucleotides.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>168</offset><text>The c-kit proto-oncogene encodes a receptor having tyrosine-specific kinase activity and has been mapped to chromosome 4 in the human and chromosome 5 in the mouse, at the dominant white spotting locus (W).

The c-kit proto-oncogene has been shown to be expressed by leukemic myeloblasts, but not by normal unseparated human bone marrow cells. The role of this oncogene in differentiation and proliferation of human hematopoietic progenitors is presently undefined. To determine c-kit expression by normal hematopoietic progenitors, CD34+ cells were isolated from disease-free human bone marrow, and RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were used to assess expression. By this method, we have demonstrated c-kit expression by CD34+ bone marrow progenitors. To address the functional requirement for c-kit expression in normal human hematopoiesis, CD34+ cells were incubated in the presence of sense, antisense, or missense oligonucleotides to c-kit, and subsequently cultured in the presence of either recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) or recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). Exposure of CD34+ cells to c-kit antisense oligonucleotides significantly inhibited colony-forming ability of cells cultured in the presence of rhIL-3, but had no effect on colony formation of cells cultured in rhGM-CSF. Together, these data suggest a possible role for c-kit in hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation that may be linked to some, but not all, stimulatory factors.</text></passage></document><document><id>1095</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with a novel missense mutation in the AVPR2 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>We describe a pediatric case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) with a novel missense mutation in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene.

Water deprivation testing demonstrated no decrease of urine volume, and urinary volume did not respond to subcutaneous injection of 0.1 U/kg pitressin. Molecular genetic analysis demonstrated that the patient had an AVPR2 missense mutation involving substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at position 205 (Y205F). It was also found that the patient's mother was heterozygous for this Y205F mutation. Analysis of the intermolecular interaction of the Tyr-205 hydrogen group by molecular modeling showed that Tyr-205 was located in transmembrane domain (TM) 5, and that its hydroxy group formed a hydrogen bond with Leu-169 main-chain =O located in TM 4. The mutation of Tyr-205 to phenylalanine would cause loss of this hydrogen bond and decrease or change the interaction between these TM coils, thus affecting the ability of AVP to bind to the receptor. According to this molecular model of AVPR2, the Y205F mutation would cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.</text></passage></document><document><id>1096</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Papillon-Lef  vre syndrome: a highly-suspected case.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>Papillon-Lef  vre syndrome (PLS) is characterized by severe periodontal disease extending to destruction of the alveolar bone surrounding deciduous teeth and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis of the skin.

Such "chimeric" YACs are not easily recognized, particularly in libraries constructed from the total DNA of an organism.

The organization of this clone indicates that it formed by in vivo recombination, presumably in yeast, between two Alu sequences located on unrelated segments of human DNA.</text></passage></document><document><id>1098</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Peroxisomal disorders.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>23</offset><text>The concept that there are human disease states that are associated with abnormal peroxisomal function is of recent origin. This is due in part to the relatively recent discovery of the organelle itself by de Duve in 1983, and to the earlier belief that it was a vestigial structure in mammals. The recognition that the organelle is significant in mammals was ushered in by Paul Lazarow's observation that rat peroxisomes catalyze the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. By 1981, more than 40 enzymes had been localized to the peroxisome, and the number continues to grow. Respect for the physiological role of the peroxisome in man has been heightened by our recent recognition that peroxisome malfunction causes profound disturbances. The Zellweger cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome represents the most serious peroxisomal disease. It is associated with malfunction of virtually every organ, and children with the disease usually do not survive beyond the 4th month. Application of newly developed diagnostic techniques has shown that the clinical spectrum and frequency of peroxisomal disorders are greater than had been realized. Eleven separate peroxisomal disorders have now been identified. Our laboratory alone has identified more than 2000 patients. Disturbances of very long chain fatty acid and ether phospholipid metabolism are present in 9 of the 11 peroxisomal disorders. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the peroxisomal disorders, with emphasis on disturbances of fatty acid and ether lipid metabolism.</text></passage></document><document><id>1099</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, a novel effector for the GTPase CDC42Hs, is implicated in actin polymerization. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>114</offset><text>The Rho family of GTPases control diverse biological processes , including cell morphology and mitogenesis .

Here, we describe a complex pathogenic rearrangement in the APC gene that was detected during deletion screening and transmitted throughout at least three generations. The rearrangement consists of a deletion of 604 bp in intron 4 that impairs the binding site of the reverse primer for exon 4 and of an insertion of 119 bp in exon 4 that interferes with the binding site of the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) probes for exon 4. The insertion is composed of three duplicated sequences derived from exon 4, intron 3, and intron 4, all in inverse direction. By transcript analysis, we found that the mutation results in complete skipping of exon 4 and that it leads to a frameshift. The rearrangement would not have been identified had it occurred outside the MLPA hybridization site. Our findings demonstrate that part of the pathogenic mutations remain undetected by routine methods. Moreover, MLPA and RNA analysis alone would have led to an incorrect interpretation of a genomic deletion of exon 4.</text></passage></document><document><id>1101</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genome-wide expression profiling of the retinoschisin-deficient retina in early postnatal mouse development.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>PURPOSE: The Rs1h knockout mouse displays retinal features typical for X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (RS). Consequently, this mouse line represents an excellent model to study early molecular events in RS. METHODS: Whole genome expression profiling using DNA-microarrays was performed on total RNA extracts from retinoschisin-deficient and wild-type murine retinas from postnatal days 7, 9, 11, and 14. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of additional time points facilitated the refinement of the temporal expression profile of differentially regulated transcripts. Differential protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Based on biostatistic and knowledge-based DNA-microarray analyses we have identified differentially regulated retinal genes in early postnatal stages of the Rs1h-deficient mouse defining key molecular pathways including adhesion, cytoskeleton, vesicular trafficking, and immune response. A significant upregulation of Egr1 at P11 and several microglia/glia-related transcripts starting at P11 with a peak at P14 were identified in the diseased retina. The results provided evidence that macrophage/microglia activation precedes apoptotic photoreceptor cell death. Finally, the role of Egr1 in the pathogenesis of Rs1h-deficiency was investigated, and the results indicated that activation of the MAPK Erk1/2 pathway occurs as early as P7. Analyses of Rs1h(-/Y)/Egr1(-/-) double-knockout mice suggest that Egr1 upregulation is not a prerequisite for macrophage/microglia activation or apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings imply that microglia/glia activation may be triggering events in the photoreceptor degeneration of retinoschisin-deficient mice. Furthermore, the data point to a role of Erk1/2-Egr1 pathway activation in RS pathogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1102</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evolutionary conservation of a germ cell-specific lamin persisting through mammalian spermiogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>We had identified earlier a germ cell-specific lamin of 60 kDa in rat which is related to somatic lamin B. This polypeptide was shown to be the only major component organizing the lamina structure of round spermatids. In the present study, we find that this 60-kDa polypeptide persists in the testicular and epididymal sperms of rat. We also show, by indirect immunofluorescence studies, that the 60-kDa protein is antigenically conserved in the germ cells of grasshopper, rooster, and frog and in plant meiocytes. The distribution of fluorescence among the various germ cell populations shows that the antigen is located around the nuclear cortex of pre- and postmeiotic germ cells, while it is distributed all over the pachytene nuclei. The anti-60-kDa polyclonal antibodies also reacted with a 60-kDa polypeptide in the Western blot analysis of nuclear matrix proteins of grasshopper germ cells. The similar fluorescent localization pattern of the antigen observed in various eukaryotic species strongly suggests that this germ cell-specific lamin may play a very crucial role during meiotic prophase, particularly during homologous chromosome pairing and recombination.</text></passage></document><document><id>1103</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sporadic hyperphosphatasia syndrome featuring periostitis and accelerated skeletal turnover without receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB, osteoprotegerin, or sequestosome-1 gene defects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>194</offset><text>CONTEXT: A middle-aged woman with recent-onset painful swollen fingers and widespread periostitis, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and accelerated skeletal turnover was found not to have mutations in the gene sequences for exon 1 of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK), osteoprotegerin (OPG), or sequestosome-1. INTRODUCTION: Hyperphosphatasia refers to disorders that feature elevated serum ALP activity (hyperphosphatasemia) usually from excesses of the bone isoform of ALP. Such conditions include familial expansile osteolysis, expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia, and a familial form of early-onset Paget's disease of bone (PDB2), all from constitutive activation of RANK, and juvenile Paget's disease from OPG deficiency. PATIENT AND METHODS: A 38-yr-old woman developed painful swollen fingers and achy bones after an episode of unexplained pericarditis and restrictive lung disease. Sequence analysis of exon 1 of TNFRSF11A encoding RANK, TNFRSF11B encoding OPG, and SQSTM1 encoding sequestosome-1 searched for mutations responsible for familial expansile osteolysis, expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia, or PDB2, juvenile Paget's disease, or Paget's disease of bone (PDB), respectively. RESULTS: Serum ALP and osteocalcin and urinary hydroxyproline were increased. Radiographs showed widespread, symmetric hyperostosis in the limbs where bone scintigraphy demonstrated enhanced radionuclide uptake. Iliac crest histology revealed accelerated skeletal turnover. No mutations were detected in the three genes examined. Three years of therapy with 70 mg alendronate orally once weekly improved symptoms, radiographic abnormalities, and biochemical markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient manifested a unique, sporadic hyperphosphatasia syndrome. Unexplained, transient inflammation seemed to cause her pericarditis, restrictive lung disease, and periostitis with accelerated skeletal turnover that responded well to antiinflammatory drugs and alendronate therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>1104</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Second cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality among 3104 patients with hairy cell leukemia: a population-based study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>BACKGROUND: The introduction of new treatments for hairy cell leukemia has resulted in improved patient survival but also engendered increasing concern about the possibility of excess second cancers. The available evidence is conflicting, with most risk estimates based on sparse numbers. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated cause-specific mortality in patients with hairy cell leukemia. METHODS: We quantified second cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality among 3104 two-month survivors of hairy cell leukemia who were reported to 16 population-based registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program between 1973 and 2002. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to quantify the risk of second cancers and causes of death, respectively. The cumulative probability of a second cancer among survivors of hairy cell leukemia was calculated using a competing risk model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Mean follow-up of hairy cell leukemia survivors was 6.5 years (range, 2 months-29.3 years). Second cancer risk was statistically significantly elevated (SIR = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.37) compared with the general population. Survivors had statistically significantly higher risks of Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 6.61, 95% CI = 2.13 to 15.42), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 5.03, 95% CI = 3.77 to 6.58), and thyroid cancer (SIR = 3.56, 95% CI = 1.30 to 7.74) and a lower risk of lung cancer (SIR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.90). The cumulative probability of all second cancers was estimated to be 31.9% (95% CI = 26.2 to 37.6) 25 years after hairy cell leukemia diagnosis. Among 10,000 hairy cell leukemia patients, a total excess of about 34 cancers, including 21 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 2 Hodgkin lymphomas, and 7 solid tumors (including 2 thyroid cancers), might be observed per year. Deaths due to solid tumors were not elevated compared with the general population (SMR = 0.9), and there were statistically significant deficits in mortality due to both cardiovascular (SMR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.80) and cerebrovascular (SMR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.93) disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hairy cell leukemia are at increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and thyroid cancer. The decrease in lung cancer incidence and smoking-associated vascular mortality may reflect an inverse association of tobacco use with hairy cell leukemia. Future studies should address the roles of immunologic impairment inherent to hairy cell leukemia, treatment modalities, and other factors as codeterminants of morbidity and mortality in hairy cell leukemia survivors.</text></passage></document><document><id>1105</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene haplotypes, plasma high-density lipoprotein levels and the risk of coronary heart disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a known inverse predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) and is thus a potential therapeutic target. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a key protein in HDL-C metabolism such that elevated CETP activity is associated with lower HDL-C. Currently available HDL-C raising drugs are relatively ineffective and evidence suggesting the role of CETP in HDL-C levels has promoted the development of CETP inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for CHD. We investigated three SNPs in the CETP gene in two cross-sectional community-based populations (n = 1,574 and 1,109) and a population of 556 CHD patients to determine if reduced CETP activity due to genetic variations in the CETP gene would increase HDL-C levels and reduce the risk of CHD. CETP genotypes and haplotypes were tested for association with lipid levels, CETP activity and risk of CHD. Multivariate analysis showed the common AAB2 haplotype defined by the G-2708A, C-629A and TaqIB polymorphisms, was consistently associated with reduced CETP activity and increased HDL-C levels. A mean increase in HDL-C levels of 0.16-0.24 mmol/l was observed in individuals with two copies of the AAB2 haplotype relative to non AAB2 carriers across all three populations (P &lt; 0.001). A case-control study of males indicated no association between single SNPs or haplotypes and the risk of CHD. These results suggest that raising HDL-C via CETP inhibition may not alter risk of CHD. Randomized control trials are needed to determine whether CETP inhibition will in reality reduce risk of CHD by raising HDL-C.</text></passage></document><document><id>1106</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Complete factor H deficiency-associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in a neonate.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>Recent advances have shown that atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a disease of complement dysregulation. Almost 50% of cases are associated with mutations in the three complement regulatory genes, factor H (HF1), membrane co-factor protein (MCP) and factor I (IF). The corresponding gene products act in concert and affect the same enzyme, alternative pathway convertase C3bBb, which initiates the alternative pathway and amplification of the complement system. Factor H (FH) deficiency-associated aHUS usually occurs in infants to middle-aged adults and only rarely in neonates. Moreover, the vast majority of patients are heterozygous for the HF1 gene mutations. We report on a case of neonatal-onset aHUS associated with complete FH deficiency due to novel compound heterozygous mutations in the HF1 gene. A 22-day-old baby girl developed acute renal failure and a remarkably low serum complement C3 level, which was rapidly followed by the development of micro-angiopathic hemolytic anemia. Western blot analysis revealed nearly zero plasma FH levels, and an HF1 gene study showed compound heterozygous mutations, C1077W/Q1139X. Renal pathology findings were compatible with glomerular involvement in HUS. The baby recovered completely after the repetitive infusion of fresh frozen plasma. During follow-up (until she was 20 months old) after the initial plasma therapy, the disease recurred three times; twice after the tapering off of plasma therapy, and once during a weekly plasma infusion. All recurrence episodes were preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection, and were successfully managed by restarting or increasing the frequency of plasma therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>1107</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Van der woude syndrome: report of a case.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>42</offset><text>SummaryA rare case of Van Der Woude Syndrome, which is characterized by pits in the lower lip and bilateral cleft of the lip and cleft palate is presented.

The cDNA encoding this fragment was then expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from the bacterial cell lysate. The recombinant polypeptide, rGpIb alpha Q221-L318, was monomeric and had an apparent molecular weight of 14,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It inhibited both ristocetin-induced binding of 125I-vWF to fixed washed platelets and ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. The recombinant polypeptide also inhibited the binding of 125I-vWF to immobilized type I and III collagen. Inhibition of 125I-vWF binding to platelets and collagen was dose-dependent, with IC50 values of 500 and 200 nM rGpIb alpha Q221-L318, respectively. Fifty % inhibition of ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination required 500 nM rGpIb alpha Q221-L318. Although rGpIb alpha Q221-L318 inhibited vWF binding to collagen it did not, itself, bind to collagen-coated surfaces. Reduction of the disulfide bond between C248 and C264 abolished activity. 125I-rGpIb alpha Q221-L318 bound directly to GpIb/IX sites on multimeric vWF. These studies document that a portion of the sequence between Q221 and L318 is needed for recognition and binding to vWF and that binding requires an intact disulfide bond between C248 and C264. The binding of this recombinant polypeptide to vWF multimers inhibits vWF interaction with two important substrates, platelet GpIb/IX and collagen.</text></passage></document><document><id>1109</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A common G10430A mutation (Gly 60 Ser) in the factor IX gene describes the presence of moderate and mild hemophilia B in the majority of the Gujarati population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>162</offset><text>Hemophilia B is an X-linked recessively inherited bleeding disorder afflicting humans across all socio-economic as well as racial groups.

We reviewed the clinical features of 7 patients diagnosed with FMF by gene analysis. METHODS: During April 2003 and March 2005, we investigated the clinical symptoms, treatment and MEFV types of 7 FMF patients who consulted the General Outpatient Clinic of Chiba University Hospital. RESULTS: Six patients were in their 20-30s, and one was 54 years of age. There were 4 males and 3 females including a mother and child, and an adult male and his female cousin. Three were solitary incidences. In addition to intermittent fever, 4 patients had chest pain, 1 had abdominal pain, and 1 had chest or abdominal pain. The frequency of attacks was once per 3 months to 1 year in the early stage of the disease, but it slowly increased with disease progression. Leukocytosis and C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation were noted during attacks in all patients. On investigation of MEFV, heterozygosity for the compound pyrin L110P-E148Q/M694I, E148Q/M694I, L110P/E148Q and heterozygosity for pyrin variant M694I alone were detected. Daily administration of colchicine at 0.5 mg prevented attacks in 6 patients, however 1 patient required 1.0 mg for adequate prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence is rare, internists should be aware of the characteristic symptoms of FMF: periodic fever and serositis symptoms, and its presence in Japan despite the disease name.</text></passage></document><document><id>1111</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characteristics of dystrophin gene mutations among Chinese patients as revealed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>133</offset><text>AIMS: To verify whether dystrophin gene mutations among Chinese patients feature different types and frequencies from other populations. METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in combination with multiplex PCR (mPCR) and/or short tandem repeat (STR)-based linkage analysis were applied in a large series of Chinese families affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). There were a total of 19 cases seeking prenatal diagnosis during their second pregnancies. RESULTS: Of the 59 family trios (51 with DMD and 8 with BMD), 40 were found to have carried various mutations of the dystrophin gene. In addition to deletions and duplications within the mutational hotspots identified by both methods, 10 mutations missed by mPCR were detected by MLPA, among which at least 3 were of rare types. Combined MLPA and linkage analysis also achieved prenatal diagnoses in all of the 19 amniocentesis samples. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations of dystrophin gene among Chinese patients showed a diverse spectrum, with similarity to as well as discrepancies from other populations. For the comprehensive coverage of all exons of the dystrophin gene, MLPA should be the method of choice for initial screening of DMD/BMD patients. When combined with STR-based analysis, it can achieve diagnosis in as much as 70-80% of all referred cases.</text></passage></document><document><id>1112</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BARD1 and breast cancer in Poland.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>35</offset><text>PURPOSE: To investigate whether or not a genetic variant in BARD1 (Cys557Ser) contributes to early-onset breast cancer in Poland, or modifies the risk of breast cancer in women with an inherited predisposition to breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied 3,188 unselected Polish women with breast cancer and 1,038 healthy controls. All women were genotyped for the BARD1 Cys557Ser variant and for known founder mutations in BRCA1 (three mutations), CHEK2 (four mutations), and NBS1 (one mutation). RESULTS: A BARD1 variant was seen in 150 of 3,188 breast cancer cases (4.7%) and in 40 of 1,038 controls (3.8%) (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.9-1.7). The risk associated with the BARD1 variant was not significantly greater in women with familial cancer (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.8-2.7), or with an inherited mutation in BRCA1 (OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.4-2.2), CHEK2 (OR = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.5-2.1), or NBS1 (OR = 1.3; 95% CI = 0.2-10.2). Modest associations were observed among the subgroups of women with very early onset breast cancer (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.2-7.1) and with medullary breast cancer (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 0.9-3.7). CONCLUSION: There was no clear association between the presence of the BARD1 Cys557Ser allele and breast cancer in Poland. Furthermore, the BARD1 Cys557Ser allele does not appear to modify the risk of breast cancers among carriers of BRCA1 mutations, or of other predisposing mutations. The allele may predispose to breast cancers of certain histologic subtypes, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings.</text></passage></document><document><id>1113</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evolutionary divergence of the pre-promotor region of ribosomal DNA in the great apes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>The human ribosomal intergenic spacer (rIGS) differs considerably on nucleotide sequence and regulatory elements positioning from their counterparts in the mouse, rat and Xenopus laevis.

The genomic structure and organization of a variant glycophorin allele specifying a novel Miltenberger (Mi)-related phenotype, MiX, were examined. This variant probably arose from a gene conversion event involving a direct repeat of the acceptor splice site. Southern blot analysis indicated that MiX gene derived its 5' and 3' portions from glycophorin B or delta gene but its internal part from glycophorin A or alpha gene. Genomic sequences encompassing the rearranged regions of the MiX gene were amplified by single copy polymerase chain reaction. Direct DNA sequencing showed that during the formation of MiX gene, a short stretch of alpha exon III with a donor splice site has replaced a silent sequence in the delta gene containing a cryptic acceptor splice site. The upstream delta-alpha breakpoint is flanked by the direct repeats of the acceptor splice site, whereas the down-stream alpha-delta breakpoint is located in the adjacent intron. This segmental transfer produced a new composite exon whose expression not only transactivated a portion of silent sequence but also created intraexon and interexon hybrid junctions that characterize the antigenic specificities of MiX glycophorin. The identification of MiX as yet another delta-alpha-delta hybrid different from MiIII and MiVI in gene conversion sites suggests that shuffling of expressed and unexpressed sequences through particular genomic DNA motifs has been an important mechanism for shaping the antigenic diversity of MNSs blood group system during evolution.</text></passage></document><document><id>1116</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Purified A2 domain of von Willebrand factor binds to the active conformation of von Willebrand factor and blocks the interaction with platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>165</offset><text>BACKGROUND: von Willebrand factor (VWF) does not interact with circulating platelets unless it is induced to expose the binding site for platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ibalpha in the A1 domain by high shear stress, immobilization, and/or a modulator. Previous studies have implied indirectly that the A2 domain may be involved in regulating A1-GPIbalpha binding. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Because the relationship between the A1 and A2 domains has not been defined, we have investigated the effect of the A2 domain on the binding activity of the A1 domain using recombinant A domain polypeptides, multimeric VWF, and monoclonal antibodies (mAb). RESULTS: The A2 domain polypeptide bound specifically to the immobilized A1 domain polypeptide or full-length VWF, with half-maximal binding being obtained at 60 or 168 nm, respectively. This A1-A2 interaction was inhibited by mAb against the A2 or A1 domain and by the A1 domain polypeptide. The A2 domain polypeptide effectively blocked GPIbalpha-mediated platelet adhesion under high flow conditions. The A2 domain polypeptide specifically recognizes the GPIbalpha-binding conformation in the A1 domain, as it only interacted with VWF activated by the modulator ristocetin or immobilized VWF. Furthermore, in contrast to plasma VWF, the ultra-large (UL)VWF multimers or a recombinant VWF-A1A2A3 polypeptide containing a gain-of-function mutation (R1308 L) of type 2B von Willebrand disease bound to the A2 domain polypeptide without the need for ristocetin.

Within the A group, seven tumours had simple abnormalities (AS), i.e., numerical changes only or a single structural aberration, and 48 had karyotypes with complex aberrations (AC). A correlation analysis between groups N and A revealed that cytogenetic abnormalities were more often found among seropapillary tumours, and that cases with abnormal karyotypes on average were of higher stage and more often had residual tumour mass after initial surgery (P less than 0.05 for all variables). When the three groups N, AS, and AC were compared, they were found to be significantly different with regard not only to the three parameters mentioned above, but now tumour grade also appeared to correlate with karyotypic pattern (P = 0.001), with poorly differentiated tumours having the most complex karyotypes. In a correlation analysis between karyotypic pattern and survival, group A patients had shorter survival than group N (P = 0.049). In the corresponding analysis between groups N, AS, and AC, the differences were also significant (P = 0.039), with shorter survival in group AC than in groups N and AS. Stage, grade, residual tumour after primary surgery, and performance status also correlated with survival time. A multivariate analysis identified abnormal karyotype as being independently associated with short survival in advanced clinical stages (P = 0.030) of ovarian carcinoma. We conclude that cytogenetic analysis of tumour cells may be of clinical value in the assessment of prognosis in patients with malignant ovarian tumours.</text></passage></document><document><id>1118</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cycloheximide facilitates the identification of aberrant transcripts resulting from a novel splice-site mutation in COL17A1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>193</offset><text>Patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa often show decreased expression of type XVII collagen , a transmembrane hemidesmosomal protein encoded by COL17A1 . This report documents a novel splice-site mutation in COL17A1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa , and applies a new methodology to define and characterize the resulting mRNA splice variants . Mutational analysis of COL17A1 identified a maternally inherited G-to-T transversion at the -1 position of exon 32 . This acceptor splice-site mutation led to the formation of aberrant transcripts present at extremely low levels . Based on our recent finding that cycloheximide stabilized mutant COL17A1 transcripts in keratinocytes homozygous for a frameshift mutation , the effects of the splice-site mutation on splicing of COL17A1 transcripts were determined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of total RNA from keratinocytes incubated for 2 . 5 h in the presence or absence of 10 microg cycloheximide per ml . Using this approach , an abnormally spliced transcript was identified that contains an extra 264 bases upstream from exon 32 , resulting in a premature termination codon 27 bp downstream from the cryptic splice site . Three other splice variants , including one derived from the skipping of exon 32 , were also identified . These results indicate the usefulness of cycloheximide treatment in evaluating the abnormal processing of mRNA due to splice-site mutations , because  ( i ) aberrant splicing often generates a premature termination codon , ( ii ) transcripts with premature termination codons can occur at low or undetectable levels due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay , and ( iii ) the levels of these transcripts can be increased by cycloheximide . </text></passage></document><document><id>1119</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever with a single MEFV mutation: where is the second hit?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) has traditionally been considered an autosomal-recessive disease; however, it has been observed that a substantial number of patients with clinical FMF possess only 1 demonstrable MEFV mutation. The purpose of this study was to perform an extensive search for a second MEFV mutation in 46 patients diagnosed clinically as having FMF and carrying only 1 high-penetrance FMF mutation. METHODS: MEFV and other candidate genes were sequenced by standard capillary electrophoresis. In 10 patients, the entire 15-kb MEFV genomic region was resequenced using hybridization-based chip technology. MEFV gene expression levels were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Pyrin protein levels were examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: A second MEFV mutation was not identified in any of the patients who were screened. Haplotype analysis did not identify a common haplotype that might be associated with the transmission of a second FMF allele. Western blots did not demonstrate a significant difference in pyrin levels between patients with a single mutation and those with a double mutation; however, FMF patients of both types showed higher protein expression as compared with controls and with non-FMF patients with active inflammation. Screening of genes encoding pyrin-interacting proteins identified rare mutations in a small number of patients, suggesting the possibility of digenic inheritance. CONCLUSION: Our data underscore the existence of a significant subset of FMF patients who are carriers of only 1 MEFV mutation and demonstrate that complete MEFV sequencing is not likely to yield a second mutation. Screening for the set of the most common mutations and detection of a single mutation appears to be sufficient in the presence of clinical symptoms for the diagnosis of FMF and the initiation of a trial of colchicine.</text></passage></document><document><id>1120</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Maternal origin of deletion 15q11-13 in 25/25 cases of Angelman syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>About half of the cases of Angelman syndrome arise from deletions of chromosome band 15q12.

It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait caused by loss-of-function mutations in the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) gene. Previously, we have shown that peripheral injection of recombinant GALC, administered every other day, results in a substantial improvement in early clinical phenotype in the twitcher mouse model of GLD. While we did detect active enzyme in the brain following peripheral administration, most of the administered enzyme was localized to the periphery. Given the substantial central nervous system (CNS) involvement in this disease, we were interested in determining whether or not a single-dose administration of the recombinant enzyme directly to the CNS, which could potentially be achieved clinically, would result in any substantial improvement. Following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of GALC we noted a significant, 16.5%, reduction in the GALC substrate psychosine, the abnormal accumulation of which is believed to play a pivotal role in the CNS pathology observed in this disease. Moreover, recombinant GALC was found not only in periventricular regions but also at sites distant to the injection such as the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Most importantly, animals receiving a single i.c.v. dose of the enzyme at postnatal day 20 survived up to 51 days, which compares favorably to the control twitcher animals, which normally only live to postnatal day 40/42. These results indicate that even a single i.c.v. administration of the recombinant enzyme can have significant clinical impact and suggests that other lysosomal storage disorders with significant CNS involvement may similarly benefit.</text></passage></document><document><id>1125</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Wilms' tumor protein Wt1 is an activator of the anti-M  llerian hormone receptor gene Amhr2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset><text>The Wilms' tumor protein Wt1 plays an essential role in mammalian urogenital development. WT1 mutations in humans lead to a variety of disorders, including Wilms' tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer, as well as Frasier and Denys-Drash syndromes. Phenotypic anomalies in Denys-Drash syndrome include pseudohermaphroditism and sex reversal in extreme cases. We have used cDNA microarray analyses on Wt1 knockout mice to identify Wt1-dependent genes involved in sexual development. The gene most dramatically affected by Wt1 inactivation was Amhr2, encoding the anti-M  llerian hormone (Amh) receptor 2. Amhr2 is an essential factor for the regression of the M  llerian duct in males, and mutations in AMHR2 lead to the persistent M  llerian duct syndrome, a rare form of male pseudohermaphroditism. Here we show that Wt1 and Amhr2 are coexpressed during urogenital development and that the Wt1 protein binds to the promoter region of the Amhr2 gene. Inactivation and overexpression of Wt1 in cell lines was followed by immediate changes of Amhr2 expression. The identification of Amhr2 as a Wt1 target provides new insights into the role of Wt1 in sexual differentiation and indicates, in addition to its function in early gonad development and sex determination, a novel function for Wt1, namely, in M  llerian duct regression.</text></passage></document><document><id>1126</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Colonic polyps in children and adolescents.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset><text>Colonic polyps most commonly present with rectal bleeding in children. The isolated juvenile polyp is the most frequent kind of polyp identified in children. 'Juvenile' refers to the histological type of polyp and not the age of onset of the polyp. Adolescents and adults with multiple juvenile polyps are at a significant risk of intestinal cancer. The challenge for adult and pediatric gastroenterologists is determining the precise risk of colorectal cancer in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. Attenuated familial adenamatous polyposis (AFAP) can occur either by a mutation at the extreme ends of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene or by biallelic mutations in the mutY homologue (MYH) gene. The identification of MYH-associated polyposis as an autosomal recessive condition has important implications for screening and management strategies. Adult and pediatric gastroenterologists need to be aware of the underlying inheritance patterns of polyposis syndromes so that patients and their families can be adequately evaluated and managed. Colonic polyps, including isolated juvenile polyps, juvenile polyposis syndrome, FAP, AFAP and MYH-associated polyposis, are discussed in the present review.</text></passage></document><document><id>1127</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mosaicism del(22)(q11.2q11.2)/dup(22)(q11.2q11.2) in a patient with features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>The chromosome 22q11 region is prone to rearrangements, including deletions and duplications, due to the presence of multiple low copy repeats (LCRs). DiGeorge/velo-cardio-facial syndrome is the most common microdeletion syndrome with more than 90% of patients having a common 3-Mb deletion of 22q11.2 secondary to non-homologous recombination of flanking LCRs. Meiotic reciprocal events caused by LCR-mediated rearrangement should theoretically lead to an equal number of deletions and duplications. Duplications of this region, however, have been infrequently reported and vary in size from 3 to 6 Mb. This discrepancy may be explained by the difficulty in detecting the duplication and the variable, sometimes quite mild phenotype. This newly described 22q duplication syndrome is characterized by palatal defects, cognitive deficits, minor ear anomalies, and characteristic facial features. We report on a male with truncus arteriosus and an interrupted aortic arch, immunodeficiency, and hypocalcemia. The patient is mosaic for two abnormal cell lines: a deletion [del(22)(q11.2q11.2)] found in 11 cells and a duplication [dup(22)(q11.2q11.2)] found in 9 cells. Molecular cytogenetic analysis in our patient revealed a 1.5 Mb deletion/duplication, the first duplication reported of this size. Deletion/duplication mosaicism, which is rare, has been reported in a number of cases involving many different chromosome segments. We present the clinical phenotype of our patient in comparison to the phenotypes seen in patients with the 22q11.2 deletion or duplication alone. We propose that this rearrangement arose by a mitotic event involving unequal crossover in an early mitotic division facilitated by LCRs.</text></passage></document><document><id>1128</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evidence for function of UDP galactose pyrophosphorylase in mice with absent galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>Mice with deletion of the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene were examined for their ability to form (13)C labeled hepatic UDP glucose from administered 1-(13)C galactose.

The link between HPRT deficiency and the neuropsychiatric symptoms is unknown. In rat B103 neuroblastoma cell membranes and mouse Neuro2a neuroblastoma cell membranes, nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase (NTPase) activity is substantially reduced, whereas in fibroblast membranes from HPRT knock-out mice, NTPase activity is increased. Candidate genes for these NTPase activity changes are ecto-nucleoside 5'-triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases). Therefore, we studied expression of NTPDases in B103 cells, Neuro2a cells and skin fibroblasts by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion of amplified cDNA fragments. In B103 cells, expression of NTPDases 1, 3 and 6 decreased, whereas expression of NTPDases 4 and 5 increased in HPRT deficiency. In Neuro2a cells, expression of NTPDases 3-6 increased in HPRT deficiency. In fibroblasts, NTPDase 3 expression decreased, and expression of NTPDases 4-6 increased in HPRT deficiency. Collectively, there are complex decreases and increases in NTPDase isoform expression in HPRT deficiency that depend on the specific cell type and species studied. These changes in NTPDase expression may reflect an (insufficient) attempt of cells to compensate for the changes in nucleotide metabolism caused by HPRT deficiency.</text></passage></document><document><id>1131</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Uniparental disomy, isodisomy, and imprinting: probable effects in man and strategies for their detection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>The concept of uniparental disomy--the presence of a chromosome pair derived solely from one parent in a diploid offspring--was introduced in 1980 as a probable consequence of the high rate of germ cell aneuploidy in man, and has now been convincingly demonstrated through molecular analyses in several families. A most likely mechanism for the production of uniparental disomy is the chance reunion, and complementation, of 2 gametes aneuploid for the same chromosome member; uniparental disomy could also occur through other mechanisms including postzygotic non-segregation in a trisomic conceptus. Uniparental disomy may result in isodisomy, i.e., homozygosity of a series of contiguous alleles in a pair of homologues. The presence and degree of isodisomy in an offspring depend in turn on the occurrence, timing, and extent of the meiotic recombination that had occurred in the chromosome pair of the disomic gamete involved. Uniparental disomy with or without isodisomy can explain a number of unusual observations, such as the unexpected pattern of transmission of a genetic disorder. The two may be associated with an imprinting effect to produce pathological phenotypes, as has been observed in the mouse, and may be the basis for a number of syndromes of as yet unclear cause. The evidence for uniparental disomy, isodisomy, and imprinting in man is reviewed, and strategies for their detection presented.</text></passage></document><document><id>1132</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genotype phenotype correlation of 30 patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) using comparative genome hybridisation array: cleft palate in SMS is associated with larger deletions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>183</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is rare (prevalence 1 in 25 000) and is associated with psychomotor delay, a particular behavioural pattern and congenital anomalies. SMS is often due to a chromosomal deletion of &lt;4 Mb at the 17p11.2 locus, leading to haploinsufficiency of numerous genes. Mutations of one of these gemes, RAI1, seems to be responsible for the main features found with heterozygous 17p11.2 deletions. METHODS: We studied DNA from 30 patients with SMS using a 300 bp amplimers comparative genome hybridisation array encompassing 75 loci from a 22 Mb section from the short arm of chromosome 17. RESULTS: Three patients had large deletions (10%). Genotype-phenotype correlation showed that two of them had cleft palate, which was not found in any of the other patients with SMS (p&lt;0.007, Fisher's exact test). The smallest extra-deleted region associated with cleft palate in SMS is 1.4 Mb, contains &lt;16 genes and is located at 17p11.2-17p12. Gene expression array data showed that the ubiquitin B precursor (UBB) is significantly expressed in the first branchial arch in the fourth and fifth weeks of human development.

PATIENTS: Family 1 included 54 descendants spanning five generations, with 12 (22.23%) individuals manifesting Van der Woude syndrome. In family 2, examinations comprised 17 descendants distributed over four generations, and 8 (47.06%) people presented features of Van der Woude syndrome. RESULTS: In family 1, the first two generations were not affected, but the other three generations had affected members showing a unique association of lip pits and cleft lip/palate with equilibrated gender distribution. In family 2, all generations were affected, and the clinical expression of disease was heterogeneous, including members with isolated clefts, isolated lip pits, and association of cleft lip/palate with lip pits. In both families, affected members transmitted their traits to descendants in an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with apparent low penetrance in family 1, but high penetrance in family 2. Patients were treated surgically by cheiloplasty and/or palatoplasty with satisfactory results. CONCLUSIONS: Van der Woude syndrome was transmitted by an autosomal dominant pattern with variable expressivity and penetrance and equilibrated gender distribution. Physicians should be aware of the variety of malformations that can be associated with Van der Woude syndrome. Genetic counseling in Van der Woude syndrome affected families is important, because a high percentage of descendants can have some kind of clefting.</text></passage></document><document><id>1135</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel fusion gene of collagen type I alpha 1 (exon 31) and platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (exon 2) in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>145</offset><text>Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon, slow growing, sarcoma of dermal and subcutaneous tissue with an infiltrative growth pattern.

Surprisingly, this was the same translocation that had provided a clue to the identification of a major causative gene for CdLS, NIPBL [Krantz et al., 2004; Tonkin et al., 2004]. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the breakpoint was confirmed to lie within NIPBL at 5p13.1. Furthermore, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) demonstrated a cryptic 1-Mb deletion harboring six known genes at 1q25-q31.1. A FISH analysis of her parents confirmed that the deletion was de novo. Although patients with interstitial deletions at 1q are rare, some of their features were similar to those observed in our patient, indicating that her clinical manifestations are likely to be affected by not only the disruption of NIPBL but also the concomitant microdeletion at 1q25-q31.1.

Here, we report frequencies of the XbaI polymorphism of the Apo B gene and we assess the effect of this polymorphism on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in Tunisian population. Blood samples from 296 Tunisian individuals (112 women and 184 men, aged 51.4+/-9.6 years), were analysed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and apolipoproteins A1 and B. In parallel, genotyping by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was performed. The XbaI polymorphism was associated with differences in plasma cholesterol (p=0.04), triglyceride (p=0.02) and apolipoprotein A1 (p=0.004), individuals with the genotype X1X1 have the lowest mean levels and those with the genotype X2X2 have the highest, with the individuals heterozygous for the polymorphism having intermediate levels. According to sex, the XbaI polymorphism effect was only observed for triglyceride in men. Thus, the results demonstrate an influence of XbaI polymorphism of Apo B gene on serum total-cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein A1 concentrations among Tunisian population.</text></passage></document><document><id>1139</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel germline mutations in BRCA2 gene among 96 hereditary breast and breast-ovarian cancer families from Kerala, South India.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>PURPOSE: Aim of the present study was to identify the genetic heterogeneity, prevalence and frequency of germline mutations of BRCA2 gene in Hereditary Breast/Ovarian cancer patients from Kerala, South India. METHODS: We analyzed 102 Breast/Ovarian cancer patients from 96 breast and/ovarian cancer families for BRCA2 gene mutations using Conformation-Sensitive Gel Electrophoresis (CSGE) followed by sequencing. RESULTS: Sequence variations in BRCA2 gene were detected in 27 (26.4%) patients. Sixteen distinct sequence variants were detected of which 11 were (69%) in exon 11. We have identified two novel disease-causing frameshift mutations (c.4642delAA and c.4926insGACC) in two unrelated patients. Apart from this, fourteen distinct sequence variants were detected in 25 breast/ovarian cancer patients of which 8 (57%) were also novel. These include nine missense mutations, one silent mutation, one-nonsense mutation and three intronic variants. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that germline mutations of BRCA2 gene account for rather small proportion of Hereditary Breast/Ovarian cancer in Kerala, South India.</text></passage></document><document><id>1140</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of novel deletions of 15q11q13 in Angelman syndrome by array-CGH: molecular characterization and genotype-phenotype correlations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>145</offset><text>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation, absent speech, ataxia, and a happy disposition. Deletions of the 15q11q13 region are found in approximately 70% of AS patients. The deletions are sub-classified into class I and class II based on their sizes of approximately 6.8 and approximately 6.0, respectively, with two different proximal breakpoints and a common distal breakpoint. Utilizing a chromosome 15-specific comparative genomic hybridization genomic microarray (array-CGH), we have identified, determined the deletion sizes, and mapped the breakpoints in a cohort of 44 cases, to relate those breakpoints to the genomic architecture and derive more precise genotype-phenotype correlations. Interestingly four patients of the 44 studied (9.1%) had novel and unusually large deletions, and are reported here. This is the first report of very large deletions of 15q11q13 resulting in AS; the largest deletion being >10.6 Mb. These novel deletions involve three different distal breakpoints, two of which have been earlier shown to be involved in the generation of isodicentric 15q chromosomes (idic15). Additionally, precise determination of the deletion breakpoints reveals the presence of directly oriented low-copy repeats (LCRs) flanking the recurrent and novel breakpoints. The LCRs are adequate in size, orientation, and homology to enable abnormal recombination events leading to deletions and duplications. This genomic organization provides evidence for a common mechanism for the generation of both common and rare deletion types. Larger deletions result in a loss of several genes outside the common Angelman syndrome-Prader-Willi syndrome (AS-PWS) critical interval, and a more severe phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>1141</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Contiguous gene deletion syndrome in Xp21: the association between glycerol kinase deficiency, congenital suprarenal hypoplasia and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>165</offset><text>INTRODUCTION: Complex glycerol kinase (GK) deficiency is a contiguous deletion of genes in Xp21 with loss of the locus for GK, for congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC) and/or for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD). We report the case of a 7-year-old patient with this rare disease. CASE REPORT: Our patient was a full-term male, with normal gestation and delivery, and no relevant family history. At the age of 11 days he presented a clinical picture of salt loss with lethargy, vomiting, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia and hyperpotassaemia. Fluid therapy and treatment with corticoids was established. The patient's condition developed with moderate mental retardation and progressive muscular weakness. In the physical examination, the skull and face were seen to be 'hourglass' shaped. Decompensations associated to infectious processes and fasting hypoglycaemia, hydroelectrolytic disorders and ketoacidosis are all frequent. Lab findings showed a drop in cortisol levels, elevation of muscle enzymes, 'pseudohypertriglyceridaemia' and raised levels of glycerol in plasma and urine. Karyotype and neuroimaging tests were normal. A myopathic pattern was observed in the electromyogram. The genetic study confirmed the deletion in Xp21 of the genes responsible for DMD, the GK deficit and AHC. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of this disease makes it possible to foresee the acute metabolic decompensations and to establish suitable genetic counselling. CK and triglyceride counts should be performed in all male patients that present a suprarenal hypoplasia; if levels are high, then it is necessary to confirm the raised glycerol values and to carry out a confirmatory genetic study.</text></passage></document><document><id>1142</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Assessment of the prevalence of the 985A>G MCAD mutation in the French-Canadian population using allele-specific PCR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>Inherited deficiency of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is a severe, sometimes fatal disorder. A single mutation in the MCAD gene, 985A>G, is involved in approximately 90% of cases. To evaluate the relevance of implementing a systematic population-based screening program in the province of Quebec using a biochemical test, we measured the prevalence of this mutation in a set of anonymous newborn samples from the Quebec City area, a region where the majority of its inhabitants are French-Canadians. An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay was designed and used to detect the mutation in 7143 DNA samples obtained from consecutive anonymous newborns. Pools of eight DNA samples were genotyped in parallel for the same mutation to validate this pooling strategy. The allelic frequency of the MCAD 985A>G mutation was found to be 0.71% and the carrier frequency 1:71 (95% confidence interval 1:55 to 1:98). This estimate predicts a homozygous frequency of 1:19,837. Ninety-nine heterozygous carriers and one homozygous individual were identified out of 7143 samples. There was 100% concordance between the individual and pooled analyses, and the pooling strategy reduced the total genotyping costs by approximately 70%. The carrier frequency estimated for this population is similar to other northwestern European populations and would support implementation of systematic newborn screening (such as tandem mass spectrometry screening) for this disease. Pooling DNA samples followed by genotyping appears to be cost-effective for estimating prevalence of rare mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1143</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of BARD1 splice-isoforms involved in human trophoblast invasion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>The tumor suppressor protein BARD1, originally discovered as BRCA1-binding protein, acts in conjunction with BRCA1 as ubiquitin ligase. BARD1 and BRCA1 form a stable heterodimer and dimerization, which is required for most tumor suppressor functions attributed to BRCA1. In addition, BARD1 has BRCA1-independent functions in apoptosis, and a role in control of tissue homeostasis was suggested. However, cancer-associated mutations of BARD1 are rare; on the contrary, overexpression of truncated BARD1 was found in breast and ovarian cancer and correlated with poor prognosis. Here we report that human cytotrophoblasts, which show a strong similarity with cancer cells in respect of their invasive behavior and capacity of matrix metalloprotease production, overexpress isoforms of BARD1 derived from differential splicing. We demonstrate that expression of BARD1 and its isoforms is temporally and spatially regulated by human chorionic gonadotropin and by hypoxia, both factors known to regulate the invasive phase and proliferation of cytotrophoblasts. Interestingly, we found a subset of BARD1 isoforms secreted by cytotrophoblasts. BARD1 repression by siRNAs, mitigates the interference of cytotrophoblasts with cell adhesion of collagen matrix-dependent epithelial cells, suggesting a role of BARD1 isoforms in extracellular matrix remodelling and in cytotrophoblasts invasion.</text></passage></document><document><id>1144</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Recessive von Willebrand disease type 2 Normandy: variable expression of mild hemophilia and VWD type 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>Missense mutations in the von Willebrand factor (VWF) gene impairing the binding to factor VIII (FVIII) do not impair the structure of VWF multimers nor the ability of VWF to aggregate platelets but causes an accelerated clearance of FVIII. Recessive VWD type Normandy (N) encompasses all patients with a deficiency in FVIII:coagulant activity (C) caused by a markedly decreased affinity of VWF for FVIII:C due to a FVIII binding defect in VWF but with normal or near normal VWF:antigen (Ag), VWF:ristocetin cofactor activity (RCo) and VWF:collagen binding (CB) levels, normal VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratio, normal VWF multimeric pattern and normal VWF-dependent platelet functions including ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation and bleeding time (BT) consistent with VWD type 1. The response to 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) of VWF parameters is usually normal, but the degree of restricted response curves to DDAVP of FVIII:C depends on the severity of the FVIII binding defect to the mutated VWF. The homozygous mutations R816W and R854W are typically associated with severe and mild VWD 1/N, respectively. Homozygous or heterozygous/null mutations of C788, D879N or C1225G do not only dramatically decrease FVIII binding, but also induce a multimerization and secretion defect with a decrease in the large VWF multimers, lack of triplet structure and prolonged BT consistent with severe VWD 2E/N. The missense mutations Y795C and R763G either heterozygous or as a component of recessive VWD (double heterozygous) are responsible for the FVIII binding defect (VWD 1/N) and abnormal banding of VWF multimers leading to the presence of a smeary pattern with the presence of ultralarge VWF multimers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1145</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A deletion mutation in COL17A1 in five Austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa represents propagation of an ancestral allele. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>159</offset><text>Patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa , a usually nonlethal form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa , have generalized blistering , nail dystrophy , patchy alopecia , and dental abnormalities .

Patient chondrocytes have a unique morphology characterized by distended rER cisternae containing lamellar deposits of COMP and other extracellular matrix proteins. It has been difficult to determine why different mutations give rise to variable clinical phenotypes. Using our in vitro cell system, we previously demonstrated that the most common PSACH mutation, D469del, severely impedes trafficking of COMP and type IX collagen in chondrocytic cells, consistent with observations from patient cells. Here, we hypothesize that PSACH and MED mutations variably affect the cellular trafficking behavior of COMP and that the extent of defective trafficking correlates with clinical phenotype. Twelve different recombinant COMP mutations were expressed in rat chondrosarcoma cells and the percent cells with ER-retained COMP was assessed. For mutations in type 3 (T3) repeats, trafficking defects correlated with clinical phenotype; PSACH mutations had more cells retaining mutant COMP, while MED mutations had fewer. In contrast, the cellular trafficking pattern observed for mutations in the C-terminal globular domain (CTD) was not predictive of clinical phenotype. The results demonstrate that different COMP mutations in the T3 repeat domain have variable effects on intracellular transport, which correlate with clinical severity, while CTD mutations do not show such a correlation. These findings suggest that other unidentified factors contribute to the effect of the CTD mutations. J. Cell. Biochem. 103: 778-787, 2008.

Recent application of tandem mass spectrometry to newborn screening has allowed a significant expansion of the recognition of individuals with IVD deficiency. Although many patients have been reported worldwide, there are no genetically confirmed patients in Korea. This study characterizes IVD mutations in seven Korean IVA patients from six unrelated families. Bi-directional sequencing analysis identified two novel variations affecting consensus splice sites (c.144+1G>T in intron 1 and c.457-3_2CA>GG in intron 4) and three novel variations altering coding sequences (c.149G>T; Arg21Leu, c.832A>G; Ser249Gly, and c.1135T>G; Phe350Val). Five patients from four families were found to be compound heterozygotes while two unrelated patients were homozygous for the c.457-3_2CA>GG variation. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that both intron variations cause aberrant splicing. Furthermore, analysis of cultured lymphocyte extracts of the seven patients showed no detectable enzyme activity and reduced levels of IVD protein (&lt;10.0% of control) in all samples. These results confirm IVD mutations in Korean patients with IVA and reveal that the mutation spectrum is different from previously reported patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1148</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Close linkage of esterase-D to unipolar depression and alcoholism is ruled out in eight pedigrees.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>Unipolar depression and alcoholism were tested for genetic linkage to esterase-D at 13q14.1.

Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1 or MDR1) is a drug transporter that extrudes colchicine out of cells. ABCB1 gene 3435C to T polymorphism has been demonstrated to alter MDR1 expression in mononuclear cells. Thus, the amount of MDR1 in mononuclear cells may alter response to colchicine. We investigated the association between MDR1 3435C to T polymorphism and colchicine response in patients with FMF. METHODS: Patients (n = 120) were examined for colchicine responses. ABCB1 gene 3435C to T genotypes were determined to analyze associations with colchicine resistance. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were evaluated as responders and 22 as nonresponders. The distributions of ABCB1 CC, CT, and TT genotypes were significantly different between responsive and nonresponsive groups (chi-square = 6.86, p = 0.032). Colchicine resistance was significantly higher in patients harboring the C allele than in patients with TT genotype (odds ratio 9.71, 95% CI 1.58-58.76). Similarly, the mean colchicine dose to prevent remission was significantly lower in the TT group compared with subjects with the C allele (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed an association between 3435C to T polymorphism and colchicine response in patients with FMF. Patients with the TT genotype for the ABCB1 3435C to T variant responded better to colchicine in terms of treatment efficacy and colchicine dose requirements.</text></passage></document><document><id>1150</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation screening of the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene in Thai pediatric patients with delayed development: first report from Thailand.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>146</offset><text>Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene, ARX, have been a cause of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and are responsible for a vast phenotypic spectrum including syndromic and non-syndromic forms of mental retardation.

This study is the first report of ARX mutational screening in Thai pediatric patients with delayed development. Two hundred and fifty-one patients participated in this study. Two hundred and three of the 251 patients were initially referred for molecular diagnosis of the Fragile XA syndrome and had negative test results. The remaining 48 patients were specifically recruited for the ARX mutational analysis and had previously reported phenotypes of the ARX mutations. Screening for the c.428_451 dup mutation was performed in all samples.

Two patients were found to have the c.428_451 dup mutation. Considering genotype-phenotype correlation, we suggest screening of the most common mutation, the c.428_451 dup mutation by PCR, in patients with infantile spasm syndrome, Partington syndrome and non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation. Screening in patients who have negative Fragile XA test results should be considered when no other known causes of mental retardation are identified especially in families with suggestive X-linked inheritance pattern.</text></passage></document><document><id>1151</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of germline variants in CDH1, IGFBP3, MMP1, MMP3, STK15 and VEGF in familial and sporadic renal cell carcinoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>BACKGROUND: The investigation of rare familial forms of kidney cancer has provided important insights into the biology of sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In particular, the identification of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) familial cancer syndrome gene (VHL) provided the basis for the discovery that VHL is somatically inactivated in most sporadic clear cell RCC. Many cases of familial RCC do not have mutations in known RCC susceptibility genes and there is evidence that genetic modifiers may influence the risk of RCC in VHL disease patients. Hence we hypothesised that low-penetrance functional genetic variants in pathways related to the VHL protein (pVHL) function might (a) modify the phenotypic expression of VHL disease and/or (b) predispose to sporadic RCC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tested this hypothesis for functional polymorphisms in CDH1 (rs16260), IGFBP3 (rs2854744), MMP1 (rs1799750), MMP3 (rs679620), STK15 (rs2273535) and VEGF (rs1570360). We observed that variants of MMP1 and MMP3 were significant modifiers of RCC risk (and risks of retinal angioma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma) in VHL disease patients. In addition, higher frequencies of the MMP1 rs1799750 2G allele (p = 0.017, OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.06-2.08) and the MMP1/MMP3 rs1799750/rs679620 2G/G haplotype (OR 1.45, 95%CI 1.01-2.10) were detected in sporadic RCC patients than in controls (n = 295). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings (a) represent the first example of genetic modifiers of RCC risk in VHL disease, (b) replicate a previous report of an association between MMP1/MMP3 variants and sporadic RCC and (c) further implicate MMP1/MMP3-related pathways in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic RCC.</text></passage></document><document><id>1152</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cancer genes associated with phenotypes in monoallelic and biallelic mutation carriers: new lessons from old players.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>Autosomal dominant cancer predisposition genes for common cancers such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer have been well recognized for over a decade.

METHODS: To determine which subjects had WT1 deletions, high-resolution chromosomal deletion analysis of the 11p13 region was carried out in 193 people with aniridia. The rationale for this was that aniridia is caused by loss of function of one copy of the PAX6 gene, and although most patients with aniridia have intragenic mutations, a proportion has deletions that also include the nearby WT1 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of patients with aniridia identifies people with WT1 deletions regardless of whether they have Wilms tumour, allowing the deletion size to be correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Wilms tumour was not observed in any case without a WT1 deletion. Of subjects in whom WT1 was deleted, 77% with submicroscopic deletions (detectable only by high-resolution FISH analysis) presented with Wilms tumour compared with 42.5% with visible deletions (detectable by microscopy). This difference was significant. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution deletion analysis is a useful tool for assessing the risk of Wilms tumour in neonates with aniridia. People with submicroscopic WT1 deletions have a significantly increased risk of Wilms tumour, and a high level of vigilance should be maintained in such cases.</text></passage></document><document><id>1154</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A mutant ataxin-3 fragment results from processing at a site N-terminal to amino acid 190 in brain of Machado-Joseph disease-like transgenic mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>147</offset><text>Machado-Joseph disease also called spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3) is a hereditary and neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by ataxin-3 with a polyglutamine expansion (mutant ataxin-3).

Mild A-T is usually caused by ATM mutations that leave residual amounts of active ATM. We studied two siblings with mild A-T, as defined by clinical examination and a quantitative A-T neurological index. Surprisingly, no ATM was detected in the patients' cells, and sequence analysis revealed that they were homozygous for a truncating ATM mutation (5653delA) that is expected to lead to the classical, severe neurological presentation. Moreover, the cellular phenotype of these patients was indistinguishable from that of classical A-T: all the tested parameters of the DSB response were severely defective as in typical A-T. This analysis shows that the severity of the neurological component of A-T is determined not only by ATM mutations but also by other influences yet to be found.</text></passage></document><document><id>1156</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Interpretation of the mouse electroretinogram.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>47</offset><text>The mouse electroretinogram (ERG) consists of a complex set of signals or "waves" generated by multiple types of retinal cell.

Conformational diseases are a class of disorders associated with the expression of misfolded protein. HFE C282Y is a mutant protein that does not fold correctly and consequently is retained in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). In this context, we sought to identify ER stress signals associated with mutant C282Y HFE protein expression, which may have a role in the molecular pathogenesis of HH. RESULTS: Vector constructs of Wild type HFE and Mutant C282Y HFE were made and transfected into HEK293 cell lines. We have shown that expression of C282Y HFE protein triggers both an unfolded protein response (UPR), as revealed by the increased GRP78, ATF6 and CHOP expression, and an ER overload response (EOR), as indicated by NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, C282Y HFE protein induced apoptotic responses associated with activation of ER stress. Inhibition studies demonstrated that tauroursodeoxycholic acid, an endogenous bile acid, downregulates these events. Finally, we found that the co-existence of both C282Y HFE and Z alpha 1-antitrypsin protein (the protein associated with the liver disease of Z alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency) expression on ER stress responses acted as potential disease modifiers with respect to each other. CONCLUSION: Our novel observations suggest that both the ER overload response (EOR) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are activated by mutant C282Y HFE protein.</text></passage></document><document><id>1158</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The TSG101 tumor susceptibility gene is located in chromosome 11 band p15 and is mutated in human breast cancer. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>Recent work has identified a mouse gene ( tsg101 ) whose inactivation in fibroblasts results in cellular transformation and the ability to produce metastatic tumors in nude mice .

It is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A). The locus for human alpha-Gal A is located on the Xq22 chromosome. Most FD mutations are confined to a single family. Although FD is an X-linked disorder, up to one third of female carriers develop clinical manifestations of the disease. It typically presents during infancy or adolescence with crisis of neuropathic pain (acroparesthesia), angiokeratomas, and asymptomatic corneal lesions. As Gb3 deposition progresses, clinical manifestations occur in other organs. Patients typically die in the fourth or fifth decade of life due to cardiac, renal or cerebrovascular complications. Usually, there is diffuse deposition of glycosphingolipid in the renal glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and vasculature. Clinically, the renal disease manifests with hypertension, microscopic hematuria (rare), moderate proteinuria, which can be in the nephrotic range, and lipiduria. End-stage renal disease can be treated with either dialysis or transplantation. Thegene for (x-Gal A was cloned and sequenced, which eventually led to production of enzyme for therapeutic use by either recombinant DNA technology or gene activation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1160</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Effect of isoflurane on muscle relaxation in a patient with myotonic dystrophy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset><text>We did anesthetic management by isoflurane for total thyroidectomy under the neuromuscular transmission monitoring in a patient with myotonic dystrophy.

It is caused by a stretch of CGG repeats within the fragile X gene, which can be unstable in length as it is transmitted from generation to generation. Once the repeat exceeds a threshold length, the FMR1 gene is methylated and no protein is produced resulting in the fragile X phenotype. The consequences of FMRP absence in the mechanisms underlying mental retardation are unknown. We have identified a male patient in a classical FRAX family without the characteristic FRAX phenotype. His intelligence quotient (IQ) is borderline normal despite the presence of a mosaic pattern of a pre-mutation (25%), full mutation (60%) and a deletion (15%) in the FMR1 gene. The cognitive performance was determined at the age of 28 by the Raven test and his IQ was 81. However, FMRP expression studies in both hair roots and lymphocytes, determined at the same time as the IQ test, were within the affected male range. The percentage of conditioned responses after delay eyeblink conditioning was much higher than the average percentage measured in FRAX studies. Moreover, this patient showed no correlation between FMRP expression and phenotype and no correlation between DNA diagnostics and phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>1162</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A high-density SNP genome-wide linkage search of 206 families identifies susceptibility loci for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders display familial aggregation. To identify a susceptibility gene for CLL, we assembled families from the major European (ICLLC) and American (GEC) consortia to conduct a genome-wide linkage analysis of 101 new CLL pedigrees using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and combined the results with data from our previously reported analysis of 105 families. Here, we report on the combined analysis of the 206 families. Multipoint linkage analyses were undertaken using both nonparametric (model-free) and parametric (model-based) methods. After the removal of high linkage disequilibrium SNPs, we obtained a maximum nonparametric linkage (NPL) score of 3.02 (P = .001) on chromosome 2q21.2. The same genomic position also yielded the highest multipoint heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) score under a common recessive model of disease susceptibility (HLOD = 3.11; P = 7.7 x 10(-5)), which was significant at the genome-wide level. In addition, 2 other chromosomal positions, 6p22.1 (corresponding to the major histocompatibility locus) and 18q21.1, displayed HLOD scores higher than 2.1 (P &lt; .002). None of the regions coincided with areas of common chromosomal abnormalities frequently observed in CLL. These findings provide direct evidence for Mendelian predisposition to CLL and evidence for the location of disease loci.</text></passage></document><document><id>1163</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Anesthesia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in a child with congenital heart disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>102</offset></passage></document><document><id>1164</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man.

The proband , a 20-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus since age 11 , lacked serum hemolytic complement activity , even during remission . C5 was undetectable in her serum by both immunodiffusion and hemolytic assays . Other complement components were normal during remission of lupus , but C1 , C4 , C2 , and C3 levels fell during exacerbations . A younger half-sister , who had no underlying disease , was also found to lack immunochemically detectable C5 . By hemolytic assay , she exhibited 1-2 % of the normal serum C5 level and normal concentrations of other complement components . C5 levels of other family members were either normal or approximately half-normal , consistent with autosomal codominant inheritance of the gene determining C5 deficiency . Normal hemolytic titers were restored to both homozygous C5-deficient ( C5D ) sera by addition of highly purified human C5 . In specific C5 titrations , however , it was noted that when limited amounts of C5 were assayed in the presence of low dilutions of either C5D serum , curving rather than linear dose-response plots were consistently obtained , suggesting some inhibitory effect . Further studies suggested that low dilutions of C5D serum contain a factor ( or factors ) interfering at some step in the hemolytic assay of C5 , rather than a true C5 inhibitor or inactivator . Of clinical interest are ( a ) the documentation of membranous glomerulonephritis , vasculitis , and arthritis in an individual lacking C5 ( and its biologic functions ) , and ( b ) a remarkable propensity to bacterial infections in the proband , even during periods of low-dose or alternate-day corticosteroid therapy .

Since the growth of prostate cancer is androgen-sensitive, metastatic disease has been treated by hormonal therapy in the form of androgen ablation. Prostate cancer cells rely on androgen receptor (AR) for proliferation and survival. AIM: To evaluate the prognostic significance of androgen receptor polymorphism in patients under hormonal therapy in any form. METHODS: Complete follow up data were available for 87 patients out of 130 patients enrolled for study. DNA was extracted from blood samples using salting out method and then subjected to PCR Genscan for CAG and GGN genotyping. The mean follow up was 10.12+/-8.83 months. RESULTS: Out of 87 patients, 64 experienced clinical as well as biochemical recurrence. The overall hormone refractory rates were 73.4% after one year. We observed a significant shorter median CAG repeats in HRPC patients (20 vs 22). The hazard ratio for HRPCs with the &lt; or =20 CAG repeat genotype was 0.602 (0.33-1.08, p=0.09). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that HRPC rates were not significantly associated with CAG repeat (p=0.06) but a trend was observed with short CAG repeats. No significant association was observed with AR-GGN repeats. CONCLUSIONS: A trend for association of AR-CAG repeats with HRPC patients in north Indian population was observed, suggesting this to be a prognostic factor for determining the therapeutic regimen.</text></passage></document><document><id>1166</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Synthetic sulfogalactosylceramide (sulfatide) and its use for the mass spectrometric quantitative urinary determination in metachromatic leukodystrophies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>155</offset><text>3-O-Sulfogalactosylceramides (sulfatides) accumulate in the genetic disease metachromatic leukodystrophy which is due to a defect in the catabolic enzyme, arylsulfatase A. Clinical diagnosis is usually confirmed by in vitro enzymatic deficiency of arylsulfatase A activity. The diagnosis may be complicated because of arylsulfatase A pseudo-deficiencies and another cause of MLD, sphingolipid activator B deficiency. As large quantities of sulfatides can be found in the urine in this disease, sulfatiduria appears as an extremely useful test. As recently enzyme replacement is underway, the quantitative determination, using an internal standard, appears particularly useful as a follow-up. Thus a non-physiological sulfatide was synthesized for this purpose, i.e. 3-O-sulfo-beta-D-C17 galactosylceramide (3-O-Sulfo-D: -Galactosyl-beta1'-->1-N-Heptadecanoyl-D-erythro-Sphingosine). It has been prepared through condensation of an azidosphingosine derivative with a protected D-galactopyranosyltrichloroacetimidate. Reduction of the azide was followed by acylation of a C-17 fatty acid. The key step was achieved by selective sulfation of the desired hydroxyl group on the sugar residue of the galactosylceramide using the stannylene methodology to give a 3'-sulfated beta-galactosyl C-17 ceramide.</text></passage></document><document><id>1167</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel heterozygous deletion within the 3' region of the PAX6 gene causing isolated aniridia in a large family group.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>Paired box gene 6 (PAX6) is the causative gene of aniridia.

It is expressed mainly in the developing eye and central nervous system. Submicroscopic copy number variations are common in the human genome. Submicroscopic deletions may cause several human diseases, either by disrupting coding sequences or by eliminating regulatory elements essential for expression of the gene in question. Over the past several years, array-based comparative genomic hybridization has become an increasingly useful tool for both identifying normal cytogenetic variations and characterizing chromosomal abnormalities associated with developmental delays and cancer. Our results support the notion that assessing copy number variation of the PAX6 gene itself and also of flanking regions, may contribute to the molecular diagnosis of aniridia.</text></passage></document><document><id>1168</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: different clinical expression in three unrelated patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>114</offset></passage></document><document><id>1169</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel mutations in the pejvakin gene are associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss in Iranian families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset></passage></document><document><id>1170</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 R841W: a strong candidate for a common mutation with moderate phenotype. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>BRCA1 mutations cause increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer , frequently of early onset .

The TNFRSF-6 gene encoding Fas is mutated in children suffering from autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), which is characterized by lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. We examined AICD in Fas-deficient T cells from ALPS patients. We showed that primary activated Fas-deficient T cells die by apoptosis after repeated T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation despite resistance to Fas-mediated cell death. This Fas-independent AICD was found to be mediated through a cytotoxic granules-dependent pathway. Cytotoxic granules-mediated AICD was also detected in normal T lymphocytes though to a lesser extent. As expected, the cytotoxic granules-dependent AICD was abolished in T cells from Rab27a- or perforin-deficient patients who exhibited defective granules-dependent cytotoxicity. Supporting an in vivo relevance of the cytotoxic granules-dependent AICD in ALPS patients, we detected an increased number of circulating T lymphocytes expressing granzymes A and B. Altogether, these data indicated that the cytotoxic granules-dependent cell death in ALPS may compensate for Fas deficiency in T lymphocytes. Furthermore, they identified a novel AICD pathway as a unique alternative to Fas apoptosis in human peripheral T lymphocytes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1172</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Development of genomic DNA reference materials for genetic testing of disorders common in people of ashkenazi jewish descent.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>Many recessive genetic disorders are found at a higher incidence in people of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent than in the general population.

Although these recommendations have led to increased test volumes and number of laboratories offering AJ screening, well-characterized genomic reference materials are not publicly available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-based Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program, in collaboration with members of the genetic testing community and Coriell Cell Repositories, have developed a panel of characterized genomic reference materials for AJ genetic testing. DNA from 31 cell lines, representing many of the common alleles for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher disease, and glycogen storage disease, was prepared by the Repository and tested in six clinical laboratories using three different PCR-based assay platforms. A total of 33 disease alleles was assayed and 25 different alleles were identified.

We report our experience with three patients presenting with clinical features of type IV EDS. A 48-yr-old woman presented with acute aortic dissection (patient 1) and 36-yr-old and 21-yr-old women presented with carotidcavernous fistula (patients 2 and 3, respectively). All three patients bruised easily. Two patients (patients 1 and 3) had thin transparent skin with visible veins. Genetic analysis of COL3A1 revealed a Gly732Val (c.2195G>T) mutation in patient 1 and a duplication of 15 base pairs (c.3221_3235dup) which resulted in an interposition of five amino acids (p.Gly1074_Pro1078dup) in patient 2. However, no mutations were observed in COL3A1 or transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 in patients 3, which might be either due to a deletion of single or multiple exons in the COL3A1 gene or due to a genetic heterogeneity.

In addition, 30% of all cases of DMD (and the genetic lesion in all three known mdx mouse models for DMD) are thought to arise from single base mutations, yet methods are not available to routinely identify and analyze these mutations and their effects on disease progression. We have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to analyze the expression of the murine dystrophin gene. A simple assay is described that distinguishes the murine dystrophin transcripts expressed from either the muscle or brain promoter. In addition, amplification of overlapping segments from the 5' end of the murine transcript has enabled the identification of DNA sequence variations between wild-type and mdx mice. These results demonstrate that the mutation in the original strain of mdx mice is distinct from those in two newer mdx isolates and that three independently isolated mdx mutants are available for study of DMD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1179</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Polynesian Origins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>20</offset></passage></document><document><id>1180</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cloning and characterization of human very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase cDNA, chromosomal assignment of the gene and identification in four patients of nine different mutations within the VLCAD gene. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>205</offset><text>Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) is one of four straight-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( ACD ) enzymes , which are all nuclear encoded mitochondrial flavoproteins catalyzing the initial step in fatty acid beta-oxidation .

For example, a hybrid gene with 5' region of red and 3' region of green is expressed in the red cones and exhibits green spectrum. Abnormality of color perception depends on the hybrid ratio of red and green genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1184</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 is produced in the developing and adult mouse eye.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>85</offset><text>PURPOSE: Musashi-1 (Msi1) is an RNA-binding protein produced in various types of stem cells including neural stem/progenitor cells and astroglial progenitor cells in the vertebrate central nervous system. Other RNA-binding proteins such as Pumilio-1, Pumilio-2, Staufen-1, and Staufen-2 have been characterized as potential markers of several types of stem or progenitor cells. We investigated the involvement of Msi1 in mouse eye development and adult mouse eye functions by analyzing the profile of Msi1 production in all ocular structures during development and adulthood. METHODS: We studied Msi1 production by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry of ocular tissue sections and by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis from the embryonic stage of 12.5 days post coitum (E12.5 dpc) when the first retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) begin to appear to the adult stage when all retinal cell types are present. RESULTS: Msi1 mRNA was present at all studied stages of eye development. Msi1 protein was detected in the primitive neuroblastic layer (NbL), the ganglion cell layer (GCL), and in all major differentiated neurons of postnatal developing and adult retinae. During postnatal developing stages, faint diffuse Msi1 protein staining is converted to a more specific distribution once mouse retina is fully differentiated. The most striking result of our study concerns the large amounts of Msi1 protein and mRNA in several unexpected sites of adult mouse eyes including the corneal epithelium and endothelium, stromal keratocytes, progenitor cells of the limbus, equatorial lens stem cells, differentiated lens epithelial cells, and differentiating lens fibers. Msi1 was also found in the pigmented and nonpigmented cells of the ciliary processes, the melanocytes of the ciliary body, the retinal pigment epithelium, differentiated retinal neurons, and most probably in the retinal glial cells such as M  ller glial cells, astrocytes, and the oligodendocytes surrounding the axons of the optic nerve. Msi1 expression was detected in the outer plexiform layer, the inner plexiform layer, and the nerve fiber layer of fully differentiated adult retina. CONCLUSIONS: We provide here the first demonstration that the RNA-binding protein, Msi1, is produced in mouse eyes from embryonic stages until adulthood. The relationship between the presence of Msi1 in developing ocular compartments and the possible stem/progenitor cell characteristics of these compartments remains unclear. Finally, the expression of Msi1 in several different cell types in the adult eye is extremely intriguing and should lead to further attempts to unravel the role of Msi1 in cellular and subcellular RNA metabolism and in the control of translational processes in adult eye cells particularly in adult neuronal dendrites, axons, and synapses.</text></passage></document><document><id>1185</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Variant translocations of chromosome 13 in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>In three cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with variant translocations, two tumors contained an identical translocation, t(1;13)(p36.1;q14); the third tumor contained a t(8;13)(p21;q14).

Five markers were most informative for mapping ADRP in this family using two-point linkage analysis. The markers, their maximum lod scores, and recombination distances were ANK1 (ankyrin)--2.0 at 16%; D8S5 (TL11)--5.3 at 17%; D8S87 [a(CA)n repeat]--7.2 at 14%; LPL (lipoprotein lipase)--1.5 at 26%; and PLAT (plasminigen activator, tissue)--10.6 at 7%. Multipoint linkage analysis, using a simplified pedigree structure for the family (which contains 192 individuals and two inbreeding loops), gave a maximum lod score of 12.2 for RP1 at a distance 8.1 cM proximal to PLAT in the pericentric region of the chromosome. Based on linkage data from the CEPH (Paris) reference families and physical mapping information from a somatic cell hybrid panel of chromosome 8 fragments, the most likely order for four of these five loci and the diseases locus is 8pter-LPL-D8S5-D8S87-PLAT-RP1. (The precise location of ANK1 relative to PLAT in this map is not established). The most likely location for RP1 is in the pericentric region of the chromosome. Recently, several families with ADRP with tight linkage to the rhodopsin locus at 3q21-q24 were reported and a number of specific rhodopsin mutations in families with ADRP have since been reported. In other ADRP families, including the one in this study, linkage to rhodopsin has been excluded. Thus mutations at two different loci, at least, have been shown to cause ADRP. There is no remarkable clinical disparity in the expression of disease caused by these different loci.</text></passage></document><document><id>1189</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A population genetic study in Finland: comparison of the Finnish- and Swedish-speaking populations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>In Finland there is a substantial but geographically limited Swedish-speaking minority (in 1980 6.3% of the total population) which originates mainly from Swedish immigrants during the years 1100-1300 AD. The admixture of this population with the neighbouring Finns was studied using more than 20 blood marker loci. The reference populations, Swedes and Finns, in spite of being part of the genetically rather uniform European populations, differ from each other genetically. These quantitative and also qualitative differences in gene frequencies are mostly due to the Finnish population possessing a number of genetic markers absent or rare in the rest of Europe. The results based on a sample of 620 individuals from the Swedish-speaking population in Finland showed a rather high degree of Finnish admixture, which was estimated to about 60%. This admixture most probably occurred at an early stage since it has reached such a high and geographically homogeneous degree.</text></passage></document><document><id>1190</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: no strict genotype-phenotype correlations but clustering of missense mutations in the amino-terminal part of the WASP gene product. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>158</offset><text>The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) gene was found to be mutated in patients presenting with WAS and in patients showing X-linked thrombocytopenia .

It is caused by mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene (OMIM 605646) encoding for pendrin. Hypothyroidism in Pendred syndrome can be--although rarely--present from birth and therefore diagnosed by neonatal screening. The aim of our study was to identify patients with Pendred syndrome among a historical cohort of patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) identified by neonatal screening, and to find their mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene. We investigated 197 Czech Caucasian children with CH detected by the neonatal screening between the years 1985 and 2005. The clinical diagnosis of Pendred syndrome was based on the laboratory and sonographic signs of thyroid dyshormonogenesis in association with sensorineural hearing loss. In subjects clinically diagnosed with Pendred syndrome, we sequenced all exons and exon-intron boundaries of the PDS/SLC26A4 gene. Hearing loss was present in 10/197 children with screening-detected CH. Of these, three fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of Pendred syndrome. Two patients were compound heterozygotes for PDS/SLC26A4 mutations: patient 1 carried c.2089+1G>A / c.3G>C and patient 2 carried p.Tyr530His / p.Val422Asp. Two of the four identified mutations were novel (c.3G>C in patient 1 and p.Val422Asp in patient 2). The third patient was free of mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene, representing a phenocopy. In conclusion, our results indicate the rarity of Pendred syndrome as a cause of CH. The identification of two novel mutations expands the spectrum of mutations in the PDS/SLC26A4 gene and emphasizes their marked allelic heterogeneity.</text></passage></document><document><id>1192</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Danon disease presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy and a complex phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLCM) was first described in 1987 and associated with dystrophin gene (DMD) mutations a decade later in one of the original two families. Here we report long-term follow-up of the second family (XLCM-2), for which a DMD mutation was never found. Analysis of the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) gene detected a novel mutation, confirming a diagnosis of Danon disease. The broad phenotype in this family included dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac pre-excitation, skeletal myopathy with high serum creatinine kinase, cognitive impairement (in males), and and a pigmentary retinopathy in affected females. Cardiac biopsy in a 13-month-old mutation-carrying male showed no vacuolization by standard histology. We conclude that XLCM may be the presenting sign of Danon disease and, in the presence of familial history of HCM, pre-excitation, skeletal muscle involvement and retinal pigmentary dystrophy should prompt LAMP-2 clinical testing. Furthermore, the absence of vacuolar myopathy in biopsies from young patients may not exclude Danon disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1193</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Partial characterization of the proteome of the mouse striatum.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>64</offset><text>Many diseases of the mammalian CNS, including Parkinson's (PD) and Lesch Nyhan disease (LND), are associated with programmatic neurodegeneration or dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon, the nigrostriatal pathway, and its projections in the striatum [1-4]. Proteomic studies on brain tissue of both animal models and human PD patients have provided evidence for dysfunction and damage of many pathways, including oxidative stress-related damage, ubiquitin-proteasome dysfunction, mitochondrial energy metabolism deficiencies, and synaptic function [5-11]. To date no such proteomic studies have been reported in the related and rare basal ganglia disorder LND, a developmental rather than a neurodegenerative neurological disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) that regulates a major step in the purine salvage pathway [12]. Many studies have demonstrated that the both human LND patients and a mouse knockout model of HPRT deficiency have significantly reduced levels and uptake of dopamine in the striatum [4, 13-16] that is likely to be the principal cause of the CNS disorder.

Children with WAGR syndrome invariably have a constitutional chromosomal deletion at 11p13. WT1 haploinsufficiency is associated with a significant risk of Wilms tumor while PAX6 haploinsufficiency lead to aniridia, both genes located in the deleted region. The 46,XY patients with WAGR syndrome are often born with genital abnormalities such as cryptorchidism or hypospadias but more rarely ambiguous genitalia. To our knowledge, complete sex reversal has never been observed in WAGR syndrome patients. Here, we report on the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular characterization of a child with WAGR syndrome and complete sex reversal. The young girl had female external and internal genitalia with normal uterus and fallopian tubes while the ovaries were not observed. Chromosomal analysis showed a 46,XY,del(11)(p12p14.1) karyotype. A 1-Mb resolution array CGH experiment estimated the size of the interstitial deletion at approximately 10 Mb encompassing WT1 and PAX6. The entire coding regions of WT1 and SRY have been sequenced and no mutation has been identified. Frasier syndrome (FS) and Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) are two disorders associated with mutations in the WT1 gene. Complete sex reversal is a feature usually present in FS and sometimes in DDS, but until now never observed in WAGR syndrome. The present report suggests that these conditions may be considered as part of the spectrum of disease due to WT1 gene alterations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1195</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The activity of p53 is differentially regulated by Brm- and Brg1-containing SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>116</offset><text>Brahma (Brm) and Brahma-related gene-1 (Brg1) ATPases share similarities in structure and function, but their presence in human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes is mutually exclusive. Although Brm and Brg1 can compensate for each other, it is possible that Brm and Brg1 have their unique properties to differentially regulate gene expression in vivo. To explore this, we examined the requirement of Brm and Brg1 for p53-dependent transcription, especially p53-mediated induction of p21 and MDM2, using cell lines in which Brm or Brg1 could be inducibly knocked down. We found that Brg1, but not Brm, is required for p21 induction in MCF7 cells. However, in Brg1-deficient H1299 cells, Brm is also required for p21 induction. Likewise, Brm is necessary for induction of p21 in MCF7 cells in which Brg1 is stably knocked down. In contrast, Brg1 has little, if any, effect on p53-mediated induction of MDM2 in cells that have Brm and vice versa. In addition, we demonstrated that the impaired induction of p21 upon Brg1 knockdown is at least in part due to decreased p53 binding to the p21 promoter. Taken together, we provided evidence that Brg1 is preferentially recruited by p53 for inducing a subset of target genes through chromatin remodeling. Thus, we hypothesize that the potential tumor suppressor function for Brg1 is mediated in part through the p53 pathway.</text></passage></document><document><id>1196</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cleavage of huntingtin by apopain, a proapoptotic cysteine protease, is modulated by the polyglutamine tract. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset><text>Apoptosis has recently been recognized as a mode of cell death in Huntington disease ( HD ) .

Ethnic background is a risk factor for advanced AMD in several populations, however the relative prevalence of this disease in different ethnic groups in the Middle East is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence of advanced AMD in Arabs and Jews in Israel. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of two independent groups of patients: the first group comprised a sequential series of Jerusalem residents who underwent photodynamic therapy for neovascular AMD (PDT group), and the second group consisted of all individuals in Jerusalem who received a blind certificate due to AMD (legal blindness group). Control groups were assessed to exclude inherited ethnic associated bias in the two study groups. RESULTS: The PDT group included 146 patients: 142 were Jews (97.3%) and 4 were Arabs (2.7%). The legal blindness group included 340 Jerusalem residents: 326 Jews (96%) and 14 Arabs (4%). The number of Arab AMD patients in the two groups was lower than expected based on the ethnic composition of the age-matched Jerusalem population (P = 0.0002 for the PDT group, and P &lt; 0.0001 for the legal blindness group). By contrast, the number of non-AMD Arab patients who were treated in the same clinic and the number of Arabs who received a blind certificate for diabetic retinopathy was not different from expected based on their relative number in the Jerusalem population. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced AMD is less common in the Arab than the Jewish population of Jerusalem. Genetic and environmental factors may account for this difference. A population-based study is required to assess the overall prevalence of AMD in Jews and Arabs.</text></passage></document><document><id>1198</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>In most patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , tumor development is initiated by somatic inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene .

In 6 ( 38 % ) of 16 tumors without LOH , one mutation was detected , and in 9 ( 56 % ) of the tumors without LOH , both mutations were found . Thus , a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients . Thirty-nine of the mutations-including 34 small mutations , 2 large structural alterations , and hypermethylation in 3 tumors-were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA . In 6 ( 17 % ) of the 36 patients , a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA , and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity . The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment . In 1 patient , somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood . In 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood , mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma .

These deletions are close to the APC and VHL genes that confer susceptibility to familial Adenomatous polyposis (OMIM #17510) and von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (OMIM #193300), respectively. The array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis using a custom Agilent 44K oligonucleotide array demonstrated an interstitial 20.7-megabase (Mb) deletion on 5q (chr5: 89,725,638-110,491,345) and a terminal 9.45-Mb deletion on 3p (chr3:pter-9,450,984). According to the March 2006 human reference sequence, the APC gene is located at chr5: 112,101,483-112,209,835 and the VHL gene is located at chr3: 10,158,319-10,168,746. These results indicate that the APC gene is 2,300 kilobases (kb) and the VHL gene is 700 kb away from deleted regions. Southern blot analysis for APC and VHL genes were negative, consistent with array-CGH findings. These results demonstrate the power of array-CCH to assess potential tumor suppressor gene involvement and cancer risk in patients with microscopically visible deletions in areas near tumor suppressors.</text></passage></document><document><id>1200</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Spindle assembly checkpoint and centrosome abnormalities in oral cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>Like many solid tumours, oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) invariably exhibit chromosomal instability (CIN) leading to aneuploidy.

This study examined the fidelity of the spindle checkpoint, together with the number, structure and function of centrosomes in a series of well-characterised aneuploid immortal OSCC-derived cell lines that harbour p53 and p16(INK4A) defects. The spindle checkpoints were fully functional in 2 of 7 cell lines and attenuated in the remaining 5 cell lines. Overexpression of the spindle checkpoint protein, Cdc20, was observed in 2 of the cell lines with attenuated checkpoints. Defects in centrosome number, size and localisation were detected in 5 of the cell lines. Clonal cell populations contained cells with both normal and abnormal numbers of centrosomes, suggesting that the control of centrosome number may be inherently unstable in OSCC-derived cell lines. Centrosomal abnormalities were then examined in tissue samples of oral epithelial dysplasias and carcinomas. Abnormal centrosomes were detected in all the tissues examined albeit in a low percentage of cells (&lt;1% to >5%). The percentage of cells containing centrosome abnormalities was significantly higher in the carcinomas than in the dysplasias (p&lt;0.02) and in the poorly differentiated SCCs relative to their moderately differentiated (p&lt;0.04) and well-differentiated (p&lt;0.01) counterparts. We suggest that the genetic alterations associated with the development of the immortal phenotype, together with spindle checkpoint and centrosome defects, are responsible, albeit in part, for the complex karyotypes observed in OSCC. The presence of centrosome abnormalities in oral dysplasias raises the possibility that such defects might contribute to malignant progression.</text></passage></document><document><id>1201</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Advances in the research on gene therapy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset></passage></document><document><id>1202</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel missense mutation in patients from a retinoblastoma pedigree showing only mild expression of the tumor phenotype. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>We have used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to study the 27 exons of the RB1 gene in individuals from a family showing mild expression of the retinoblastoma phenotype .

Plant sterols (PS), dissolved in diacylglycerol (DAG) oil, (PS/DAG) can be effective at a relatively low dose. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of PS/DAG oil on blood cholesterol concentrations in hypercholesterolemic outpatients on low-dose pravastatin (10 mg/day). METHODS AND RESULTS: The patients (n=61) were randomly assigned to one of three groups, who consumed TAG (control), DAG or PS/DAG oil. The average intake of PS from the PS/DAG oil during the test period was significantly higher than that for TAG and DAG oils (502 vs. 49 and 38 mg/day, P&lt;0.05). Significant cholesterol-lowering effects from the baseline were observed in the case of the PS/DAG oil treatment alone. Changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were inversely correlated with baseline serum campesterol concentrations (r=-0.560, P&lt;0.05), but not baseline LDL cholesterol concentrations. In addition, serum apolipoprotein B concentrations were reduced to a greater extent in subjects with high versus low levels of baseline campesterol (-13.2 mg/dL vs. -3.1 mg/dL, P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, there was a mild, but significant reduction in serum lipoprotein (a) concentration from the baseline (-5.9 mg/dL), which was correlated with the reduction in serum apolipoprotein B concentration (r=0.596, P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: A low-dose combination of PS/DAG oil and pravastatin may be a useful strategy for further ameliorating blood cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) concentrations for hypercholesterolemic patients with a low response to pravastatin.</text></passage></document><document><id>1204</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Acute hepatitis in a patient with familial Mediterranean fever.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>64</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis.

The majority of the tumour samples were fixed either in formalin or Bouin's solutions. The majority of the tumours were of the clear cell RCC subtype (48 including 2 cystic RCC). Mutation screening of the 3 VHL coding exons was carried out. A descriptive analysis was performed to compare exposed and non exposed cases of clear cell RCC in terms of prevalence of mutations in both groups. RESULTS: In the 48 cases of RCC, four VHL mutations were detected: within exon 1 (c.332G>A, p.Ser111Asn), at the exon 2 splice site (c.463+1G>C and c.463+2T>C) and within exon 3 (c.506T>C, p.Leu169Pro).No difference was observed regarding the frequency of mutations in exposed versus unexposed groups: among the clear cell RCC, 25 had been exposed to TCE and 23 had no history of occupational exposure to TCE. Two patients with a mutation were identified in each group. CONCLUSION: This study does not confirm the association between the number and type of VHL gene mutations and exposure to TCE previously described.</text></passage></document><document><id>1207</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mouse chromosome 9.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>20</offset></passage></document><document><id>1208</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The mouse homolog of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene is highly conserved and maps near the scurfy (sf) mutation on the X chromosome. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>150</offset><text>The mouse WASP gene , the homolog of the gene mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome , has been isolated and sequenced . the predicted amino acid sequence is 86 % identical to the human WASP sequence .

Plasma total cholesterol (TC) levels have been connected to degenerative disorders, but data for HD are lacking. We estimated plasma TC in three groups of HD related subjects: (a) patients with overt symptomatology, (b) subjects with expanded CAG repeat number in the Huntington gene before disease onset, and (c) siblings or descendants of HD patients, with normal CAG repeat number. Compared to TC levels of age-matched controls, all three groups had significantly lower plasma TC levels. The expected positive correlation of TC to age, present in the control group, was absent in the whole group or the three subgroups of the HD subjects. TC of the ApoE genotype subgroups showed small, non-significant differences. In the group of patients, TC levels were not related to severity of illness, duration of illness, and presence of depression or dementia in their symptomatology, while lower TC levels were found in patients with psychotic features. The results indicate altered cholesterol homeostasis in members of families with HD patients. Low TC levels have been connected to increased suicide risk in several studies, and high suicidal ideation has been reported in both HD gene carriers and non-carriers. Although low plasma TC levels do not necessarily imply alterations in brain cholesterol levels, a more detailed study of plasma lipids in HD patients and their first-degree relatives, as well as the search for genetic factors regarding cholesterol synthesis and disposition, are warranted.</text></passage></document><document><id>1211</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Effect of apolipoprotein M on high density lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis in low density lipoprotein receptor knock-out mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>138</offset><text>To investigate the role of apoM in high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism and atherogenesis, we generated human apoM transgenic (apoM-Tg) and apoM-deficient (apoM(-/-)) mice.

Human apoM overexpression (11-fold) increased plasma cholesterol concentration by 13-22%, whereas apoM deficiency decreased it by 17-21%. The size and charge of apoA-I-containing HDL in plasma were not changed in apoM-Tg or apoM(-/-) mice. However, in plasma incubated at 37 degrees C, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-dependent conversion of alpha- to pre-alpha-migrating HDL was delayed in apoM-Tg mice. Moreover, lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase-independent generation of pre-beta-migrating apoA-I-containing particles in plasma was increased in apoM-Tg mice (4.2 +/- 1.1%, p = 0.06) and decreased in apoM(-/-) mice (0.5 +/- 0.3%, p = 0.03) versus controls (1.8 +/- 0.05%). In the setting of low density lipoprotein receptor deficiency, apoM-Tg mice with approximately 2-fold increased plasma apoM concentrations developed smaller atherosclerotic lesions than controls. The effect of apoM on atherosclerosis may be facilitated by enzymatic modulation of plasma HDL particles, increased cholesterol efflux from foam cells, and an antioxidative effect of apoM-containing HDL.</text></passage></document><document><id>1212</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Genetic aspects of vitamin D-deficient rickets: genetic markers of blood].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>Polymorphism of the AB0 blood groups, haptoglobin Hp, vitamin-D-binding protein (Gc), transferrin (Tf), alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) and serum alkaline phosphatase (Pp) was studied in a group of children suffering from rickets (VDDR) and in a adequate control group of healthy individuals of the same sex-age composition. Considerable differences were revealed between the VDDR patients and healthy individuals in frequencies of the PIM1 and PIM2 factors on the alpha 1-AT system, r and p of the AB0 system as well as the Hp. Increase in a portion of one of the homozygotes for the Hp and for the alpha 1-AT system took place at the expense of other homozygote proportion (the latter being decreased). Heterozygotes frequencies remained intact in both compared groups. Atypical combination of phenotypes and gene frequencies was observed in a group of patients in the alpha 1-AT and AB0 systems as compared with usual distribution in European population. Higher frequencies of rare alleles of the loci under study were observed in the VDDR patients, which is partially reflected in increase in heterozygosity level in total within a cogort of patients analysed.

DUOX2 deficiency produces congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in humans and mice. We recently cloned a novel gene, the product of which (dual oxidase maturation factor 2; DUOXA2) is required to express DUOX2 enzymatic activity. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify DUOXA2 mutations as a novel cause of CH due to dyshormonogenesis. PATIENTS: Subjects included 11 CH patients with partial iodine organification defect but negative for other known genetic causes of partial iodine organification defect. RESULTS: One Chinese patient born to nonconsanguineous parents was homozygous for a nonsense mutation (p.Y246X), producing a truncated DUOXA2 protein lacking transmembrane helix 5 and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The mutant protein was inactive in reconstituting DUOX2 in vitro. Pedigree analysis demonstrated recessive inheritance, because heterozygous carriers had normal thyroid function including negative results in neonatal TSH screening. One heterozygous carrier of Y246X was identified in unrelated Chinese controls (n = 92) but not in Caucasian or Japanese controls, indicating that homozygosity for Y246X could be a frequent cause of CH in Chinese. Functional studies suggest that the DUOXA2 paralog (DUOXA1) can partially compensate DUOXA2 deficiency, consistent with the proband having a milder CH phenotype than patients with biallelic DUOX2 nonsense mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first mutation in DUOXA2, identified in a patient with CH and dyshormonogenic goiter. Results of our studies provide evidence for the critical role of DUOXA2 in thyroid hormonogenesis. Biallelic DUOXA2 mutations are a novel genetic event in permanent CH.</text></passage></document><document><id>1214</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Screening for Tay-Sachs disease: a note of caution.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset></passage></document><document><id>1215</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>ATM mutations and phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia families in the British Isles: expression of mutant ATM and the risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>165</offset><text>We report the spectrum of 59 ATM mutations observed in ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients in the British Isles .

COBRA1 modulates estrogen-dependent and independent transcription and suppresses the growth of breast cancer cells. Its expression is significantly reduced in metastatic and recurrent breast cancer, pointing to a tumor suppressor function in breast cancer development. In light of these initial implications of COBRA1 in human breast cancer, the current investigation sought to obtain more direct functional evidence that links COBRA1 with BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation in breast cancer cells. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated gene knockdown and gene expression microarray were used to study the impact of COBRA1 and BRCA1 on global transcription in the same breast cancer cell background. The gene expression profiling study in tissue culture cells uncovers a significant overlap of COBRA1- and BRCA1-regulated genes, many of which have been previously implicated in breast cancer progression. The data shown herein support the notion that COBRA1 and BRCA1 may engage in common gene regulatory pathways to suppress breast cancer progression.</text></passage></document><document><id>1218</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Over-expressed human divalent metal transporter 1 is involved in iron accumulation in MES23.5 cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>Elevated iron accumulation has been reported in brain regions in some neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanism for this is largely unknown. Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is an important divalent cation transporter. The aim of the present study is to construct recombinant adenovirus encoding human DMT1 with iron responsive element (DMT1+IRE) and infect MES23.5 dopaminergic cells in order to investigate the relationship between increased DMT1+IRE expression and iron accumulation. The human DMT1 gene was obtained by RT-PCR from tissues of human duodenum. AdDMT1+IRE was successfully constructed and identified by PCR, restriction endonuclease analyses and DNA sequencing, respectively. It was able to efficiently infect MES23.5 cells, which was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blots. When incubated with 100 microM ferrous iron for 6h, the intracellular iron levels dramatically increased in AdDMT1+IRE infected MES23.5 cells compared to the solely adenovirus infected cells. Meanwhile, the levels of hydroxyl free radicals and malondialdehyde (MDA) in these cells increased. This led to the activation of caspase-3. The apoptosis in AdDMT1+IRE infected cells was shown with hypercondensed nuclei using Hoechst staining. Analysis of DNA extracted from these cells showed the typical "ladder pattern", indicating the formation of mono- and oligonucleosomes. These results suggested that increased DMT1+IRE expression in MES23.5 cells caused the increased intracellular iron accumulation. This resulted in the increased oxidative stress leading to ultimate cell apoptosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1219</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis is caused by deleterious mutations in SAMD9, encoding a TNF-alpha responsive protein.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>132</offset><text>Normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (NFTC) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by calcium deposition in skin and mucosae and associated with unremitting pain and life-threatening skin infections. A homozygous missense mutation (p.K1495E), resulting in SAMD9 protein degradation, was recently shown to cause NFTC in five families of Jewish-Yemenite origin. In this study, we evaluated another Jewish-Yemenite NFTC kindred. All patients were compound heterozygous for two mutations in SAMD9: K1495E and a previously unreported nonsense mutation, R344X, predicted to result in a markedly truncated molecule. Screening of unaffected population-matched controls revealed heterozygosity for K1495E and R344X only in individuals of Jewish-Yemenite ancestry, but not in more than 700 control samples of other origins, including 93 non-Jewish Yemenite. These data may be suggestive of positive selection, considering the rarity of NFTC and the small size of the Jewish-Yemenite population; alternatively, they may reflect genetic drift or the effect of a population-specific modifier trait. Calcifications in NFTC generally develop over areas subjected to repeated trauma and are associated with marked inflammatory manifestations, indicating that SAMD9 may play a role in the inflammatory response to tissue injury. We therefore assessed the effect of cellular stress and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, on SAMD9 gene expression. Whereas exogenous hydrogen peroxide and heat shock did not affect SAMD9 transcription, osmotic shock was found to markedly upregulate SAMD9 expression. In addition, incubation of endothelial cells with TNF-alpha caused a dose-related, p38-dependant increase in SAMD9 expression. These data link NFTC and SAMD9 to the TNF-alpha signaling pathway, suggesting a role for this system in the regulation of extra-osseous calcification.</text></passage></document><document><id>1220</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Inherited colorectal polyposis and cancer risk of the APC I1307K polymorphism. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>Germ-line and somatic truncating mutations of the APC gene are thought to initiate colorectal tumor formation in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis , respectively .

Here we show that chloroquine, a drug that activates the stress-responsive Atm-p53 tumor-suppressor pathway, preferentially enhances the death of Myc oncogene-overexpressing primary mouse B cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and impairs Myc-induced lymphomagenesis in a transgenic mouse model of human Burkitt lymphoma. Chloroquine-induced cell death in primary MEFs and human colorectal cancer cells was dependent upon p53, but not upon the p53 modulators Atm or Arf. Accordingly, chloroquine impaired spontaneous lymphoma development in Atm-deficient mice, a mouse model of ataxia telangiectasia, but not in p53-deficient mice. Chloroquine treatment enhanced markers of both macroautophagy and apoptosis in MEFs but ultimately impaired lysosomal protein degradation. Interestingly, chloroquine-induced cell death was not dependent on caspase-mediated apoptosis, as neither overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 nor deletion of the proapoptotic Bax and Bak affected chloroquine-induced MEF death. However, when both apoptotic and autophagic pathways were blocked simultaneously, chloroquine-induced killing of Myc-overexpressing cells was blunted. Thus chloroquine induces lysosomal stress and provokes a p53-dependent cell death that does not require caspase-mediated apoptosis. These findings specifically demonstrate that intermittent chloroquine use effectively prevents cancer in mouse models of 2 genetically distinct human cancer syndromes, Burkitt lymphoma and ataxia telangiectasia, suggesting that agents targeting lysosome-mediated degradation may be effective in cancer prevention.</text></passage></document><document><id>1222</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular genetics of RB1--the retinoblastoma gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset><text>Thirty-seven years ago Alfred Knudson proposed his "two-hit" theory of the molecular etiology of retinoblastoma, establishing an elegant conceptual paradigm for tumorigenesis in general.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate BRCA1 carrier prevalence in Hispanic, African American, and Asian American female breast cancer patients compared with non-Hispanic white patients with and without Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We estimated race/ethnicity-specific prevalence of BRCA1 in a population-based, multiethnic series of female breast cancer patients younger than 65 years at diagnosis who were enrolled at the Northern California site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry during the period 1996-2005. Race/ethnicity and religious ancestry were based on self-report. Weighted estimates of prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were based on Horvitz-Thompson estimating equations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimates of BRCA1 prevalence. RESULTS: Estimates of BRCA1 prevalence were 3.5% (95% CI, 2.1%-5.8%) in Hispanic patients (n = 393), 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.6%) in African American patients (n = 341), and 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1%-2.0%) in Asian American patients (n = 444), compared with 8.3% (95% CI, 3.1%-20.1%) in Ashkenazi Jewish patients (n = 41) and 2.2% (95% CI, 0.7%-6.9%) in other non-Hispanic white patients (n = 508). Prevalence was particularly high in young (&lt;35 years) African American patients (5/30 patients [16.7%]; 95% CI, 7.1%-34.3%). 185delAG was the most common mutation in Hispanics, found in 5 of 21 carriers (24%). CONCLUSIONS: Among African American, Asian American, and Hispanic patients in the Northern California Breast Cancer Family Registry, the prevalence of BRCA1 mutation carriers was highest in Hispanics and lowest in Asian Americans. The higher carrier prevalence in Hispanics may reflect the presence of unrecognized Jewish ancestry in this population.</text></passage></document><document><id>1226</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Influence of PAX6 gene dosage on development: overexpression causes severe eye abnormalities. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Aniridia in man and Small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene PAX6 .

In contrast to the expectation that wild-type (WT) males born to H (fmr-1(+/-)) mothers (H>WT) are behaviorally normal and indistinguishable from WT males born to WT mothers (WT>WT); here, we show that H>WT offspring are more active than WT>WT offspring and that their hyperactivity is similar to male KO mice born to H or KO (fmr-1(-/-)) mothers (H>KO/KO>KO). H>WT mice, however, do not exhibit seizures or abnormal sensory processing. Consistent with their hyperactivity, the effect of the D2 agonist quinpirole is reduced in H>WT as well as in H>KO and KO>KO mice compared to WT>WT offspring, suggesting a diminished feedback inhibition of dopamine release.

However, physiological and molecular models which may account for this association are not readily available. We have found that the stress hormone hydrocortisone (cortisol) down-regulates the expression of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 in the nonmalignant mouse mammary cell line EPH4. This effect is concentration-dependent, is reliant on the continuous presence of hydrocortisone, and is not affected by the addition of lactogenic hormones, or growth conditions. Hydrocortisone was also found to negate a known positive effect of estrogen on BRCA1 expression and, therefore, may interfere with estrogen-related signaling in mammary epithelial cells. The repressive effect of hydrocortisone is diminished or lost in the mouse mammary lines HC-11 and SP1, respectively, suggesting regulation of the BRCA1 may differ between lines. We have uncovered two promoter regulatory sites, which are involved in BRCA1 regulation by hydrocortisone, namely the RIBS and UP regulatory elements. Binding of the transcription factor GABP to both sites is lost upon hydrocortisone addition, though the levels of these factors are not altered by hydrocortisone treatment. Because BRCA1 activity is important for a number of intracellular pathways involved in prevention of tumorigenesis, its observed down-regulation may represent a novel molecular mechanism for cortisol's involvement in breast cancer development.</text></passage></document><document><id>1233</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The Italian National Survey for Prader-Willi syndrome: an epidemiologic study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>Twenty-five medical centers and the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) Association collaborated on a study which attempted to identify all people with genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS living in Italy. Investigators of the participating centers contacted PWS subjects and/or their family, filled in a specially developed form with the required data and forwarded this information by email. The study identified 425 subjects (209 males and 216 females, between the ages of 0.4-46.7). Two hundred thirty-eight patients had del15, 104 had UPD15, 4 demonstrated a translocation affecting chromosome 15 and 79 showed a positive methylation test. There were fewer subjects found over the age of 35, probably due to the low rate of identification of older PWS patients as well as the high mortality rate. There were a greater number of male children and adolescents with PWS whilst, amongst adults, there were more females. As expected, the majority of subjects with PWS were obese, especially in adult life. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that 26% of patients aged between 6 and 17 were normal weight. A total of 212 subjects had received GH treatment, of which 141 were still receiving therapy, while the remaining 71 had stopped. In children and adolescents (233 cases), 89 subjects had never undergone GH therapy. Eighteen PWS patients had died in the past 20 years. Obesity-related cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were the cause of death, both during childhood and after 18 years of age. Three children died suddenly whilst undergoing GH therapy. Respiratory infection and cardiac illness were the causes of death in two cases. There was no definitive cause of death found in the third case. Overall, there was no increase in number of deaths during GH treatment, suggesting that GH administration in patients with PWS, as a group, does not increase the risk of death.</text></passage></document><document><id>1234</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Expression of p53 during mouse embryogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>46</offset><text>By in situ hybridisation we have examined the expression of p53 during mouse embryogenesis from day 8.5 to day 18.5 post coitum (p.c.). High levels of p53 mRNA were detected in all cells of the day 8.5 p.c. and 10.5 p.c. mouse embryo. However, at later stages of development, expression became more pronounced during differentiation of specific tissues e.g. of the brain, liver, lung, thymus, intestine, salivary gland and kidney. In cells undergoing terminal differentiation, the level of p53 mRNA declined strongly. In the brain, hybridisation signals were also observed in postmitotic but not yet terminally differentiated cells. Therefore, gene expression of p53 does not appear to be linked with cellular proliferation in this organ. A proposed role for p53 in cellular differentiation is discussed.</text></passage></document><document><id>1235</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Expression pattern of the Brachyury gene in whole-mount TWis/TWis mutant embryos.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset><text>The murine Brachyury (T) gene is required in mesoderm formation. Mutants carrying different T alleles show a graded severity of defects correlated with gene dosage along the body axis. The phenotypes range from shortening of the tail to the malformation of sacral vertebrae in heterozygotes, and to disruption of trunk development and embryonic death in homozygotes. Defects include a severe disturbance of the primitive streak, an early cessation of mesoderm formation and absence of the allantois and notochord, the latter resulting in an abnormality of the neural tube and somites. The T gene is expressed in nascent mesoderm and in the notochord of wild-type embryos. Here the expression of T in whole-mount mutant embryos homozygous for the T allele TWis is described. The TWis gene product is altered, but the TWis/TWis phenotype is very similar to that of T/T embryos which lack T. In early TWis/TWis embryos T expression is normal, but ceases prematurely during early organogenesis coincident with a cessation of mesoderm formation. The archenteron/node region is disrupted and the extension of the notochord precursor comes to a halt, followed by a decrease and finally a complete loss of T gene expression in the primitive streak and the head process/notochord precursor. It appears that the primary defect of the mutant embryo is the disruption of the notochord precursor in the node region which is required for axis elongation. Thus the T gene product is directly or indirectly involved in the organization of axial development.</text></passage></document><document><id>1236</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Diagnostic criteria for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset></passage></document><document><id>1237</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Difference in characteristics of APC mutations between colonic and extracolonic tumors of FAP patients: variations with phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>To clarify the differences in characteristics of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations between colorectal tumors from various phenotypes of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and between colorectal and extracolonic tumors, we analyzed APC mutations in 86 colorectal tumors from FAP patients including profuse, sparse and attenuated types, 23 sporadic colorectal tumors and 40 FAP extracolonic tumors including duodenal, gastric and desmoid tumors. In all tumors, 1 allele of the truncated APC gene retained armadillo repeats, 15-amino-acid (aa) repeats and various numbers of 20-aa repeats, but lacked SAMP repeats, as a result of germline and somatic mutations. Regarding 20-aa repeats, the truncated APC gene retained 1 repeat due to allele loss in 96% (27/28) of colorectal tumors from profuse-type FAP, 69% (36/52) of sparse-type retained 2 repeats due to somatic mutation, and 100% (6/6) of attenuated-type retained 2 or 3 repeats due to the third or second hit. In sporadic colorectal tumors 74% (17/23) retained 1 or 2 repeats. The truncated APC gene retained 3 repeats in 88% (7/8) of FAP duodenal tumors, 100% (26/26) of gastric tumors retained 2 or 3 repeats and 83% (5/6) of desmoid tumors retained 2 repeats. These data suggest that the number of beta-catenin downregulating 20-aa repeats in truncated APC gene associated with colorectal tumorigenesis is different in profuse, sparse and attenuated types of FAP, and that the association with tumorigenesis is also different between colorectal and extracolonic tumors.</text></passage></document><document><id>1238</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>X-linked and FSH dystrophies in one family.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset><text>A family is reported in which the father was affected by facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy FSHD.

We now report that a cloned human placental PRAD1 complementary DNA encodes a protein of 295 amino acids with sequence similarities to the cyclins. Cyclins can form a complex with and activate p34cdc2 protein kinase, thereby regulating progress through the cell cycle. PRAD 1 messenger RNA levels vary dramatically across the cell cycle in HeLa cells. Addition of the PRAD1 protein to interphase clam embryo lysates containing inactive p34cdc2 kinase and lacking endogenous cyclins allows it to be isolated using beads bearing p13suc1, a yeast protein that binds cdc2 and related kinases with high affinity and coprecipitates kinase-associated proteins. Addition of PRAD1 also induces phosphorylation of histone H1, a preferred substrate of cdc2. These data suggest that PRAD1 encodes a novel cyclin whose overexpression may play an important part in the development of various tumours with abnormalities in 11q13.</text></passage></document><document><id>1241</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Model for alternative splicing of insulin receptor in myotonic dystrophy type 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>Muscular dystrophy is a common multisystem disease, which results from the impairment of alternative splicing.

The prototype of this group of disorders is the cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome of Zellweger. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we report a patient with Zellweger syndrome, who presented at the age of 3 months with icterus, dystrophy, axial hypotonia, facial dysmorphy, posterior embryotoxon, and hepatomegaly. Abnormal findings of metabolic screening tests included hyperbilirubinaemia, hypoketotic dicarboxylic aciduria, increased C(26:0) and decreased C(22:0) plasma levels, and strongly reduced plasmalogen concentrations. In fibroblasts, both peroxisomal alpha- and beta-oxidation were impaired. Liver histology revealed bile duct paucity, cholestasis, arterial hyperplasia, very small branches of the vena portae, and parenchymatic destruction. Immunocytochemical analysis of cultured fibroblasts demonstrated that the cells contain peroxisomal remnants lacking apparent matrix protein content and PEX14, a central membrane component of the peroxisomal matrix protein import machinery. Transfection of fibroblasts with a plasmid coding for wild-type PEX14 restored peroxisomal matrix protein import, indicating that the primary genetic defect affecting the patient is indeed linked to PEX14. Mutational analysis of this gene revealed a genomic deletion leading to the deletion of exon 3 from the coding DNA (c.85-?_170+?del) and a concomitant change of the reading frame (p.[Ile29_Lys56del;Gly57GlyfsX2]). CONCLUSIONS: This report represents the second PEX14-deficiency associated with Zellweger syndrome and the first documentation of a PEX14-deficient patient with detailed clinical follow-up and biochemical, morphological, and radiological data.</text></passage></document><document><id>1244</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations in the arginine-rich protein gene (ARP) in pancreatic cancer. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>The ARP gene encodes a highly conserved arginine-rich protein from chromosomal band 3p21 . 1 1 .

However, the functional effects of their polymorphism remain largely unknown to date. Thus, the present study was undertaken to determine the association of the polymorphisms KIRs gene and HLA-C alleles with the susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) by means of polymerase chain reaction/sequence-specific primers for genotyping KIRs from genomic DNA of 119 patients with AS together with 128 healthy donors as a control group. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found that the frequencies of KIR3DS1 and KIR2DL5 were statistically significantly higher in the patient group than those in the control group (P = 0.016 and P = 0.003, respectively). Meanwhile, the percentage of patients, who were carrying two or more of the activating KIRs, was higher than that of control group. With respect to HLA-C alleles, individuals with AS showed an increased frequency of HLA-Cw02. If HLA-C was divided into group 1 or group 2 based on whether there was an asparagine or lysine present at position 80 of the alpha-chain, HLA-C group 2 was more common in subjects with AS compared to control subjects. The genotype 2DS1+/HLA-C lys(80)+ was more common in subjects with AS. Moreover, the CD69 expression, a NK activation marker, remarkably increased in patient with AS. CONCLUSION: In conclusions, this study suggests that KIR3DS1 may severe as AS susceptive genes to trigger continuous injury of arthrosis. The imbalance of activating and inhibitory KIR as well as HLA-C group 1 and group 2 may be the key factor, which influences the pathogenesis of AS. Moreover, KIR2DS1 might associate with the susceptibility of AS by influencing NK cell activity once group 2 HLA-C ligands are present.</text></passage></document><document><id>1248</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular analysis of digenic inheritance in Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Bartter syndrome (BS) is a genetic disorder accompanied by hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. BS with sensorineural deafness (SND, OMIM602522) is a newly identified phenotype caused by mutations in the BSND gene that encodes barttin, a beta-subunit for chloride channel ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb and classified as type IV BS. Type IV BS features the most severe phenotype entailing life-threatening neonatal volume depletion and chronic renal failure developing during infancy. A recent report described a case of BS with SND from a consanguineous family who showed homozygous mutations in the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes. This case indicated the possibility of the occurrence of digenic inheritance in BS with SND resulting from double mutations in the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes. SUBJECT AND RESULTS: The current report concerns a 2-year-old girl from a non-consanguineous family with BS accompanied by SND. In our case, four loss-of-function mutations, consisting of mutations in both parental alleles in both CLCNKA and CLCNKB, were identified. The paternal allele had a nonsense mutation (Q260X) in CLCNKA and a splicing site mutation (IVS17+1 g>a) in CLCNKB. The maternal allele had a large deletion mutation (about 12 kbp) extending from CLCNKA to CLCNKB. Our case provides clear evidence that loss-of-function alleles in both alleles of both CLCNKA and CLCNKB results in a phenotype indistinguishable from that of mutations in BSND (type IV BS). CONCLUSIONS: Recent advances in genetics have resulted in a better understanding of many human inherited diseases, but most of them are monogenic disorders and more complex inheritance patterns remain unresolved. Our case provides clear evidence of digenic inheritance outside the scope of Mendelian inheritance disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>1249</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Normal HPRT coding region in complete and partial HPRT deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive inborn error of metabolism due to a virtually complete lack of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity (OMIM 300322).

Previously assigned to chromosome 22, IDUA now has been localized to 4p16.3, the region of chromosome 4 associated with Huntington's disease (HD). The existence of a battery of cloned DNA, physical map information, and genetic polymorphism data for this region has allowed the rapid fine mapping of IDUA within the terminal cytogenetic band of 4p. IDUA was found to be coincident with D4S111, an anonymous locus displaying a highly informative multiallele DNA polymorphism. This map location, 1.1 X 10(6) bp from the telomere, makes IDUA the most distal cloned gene assigned to 4p. However, it falls within a segment of 4p16.3 that has been eliminated from the HD candidate region, excluding a role for IDUA in this disorder.</text></passage></document><document><id>1255</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic study of non-dystrophic myotonia in French-Canadians.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>Thirty-three French-Canadian families with non-dystrophic myotonia were identified. Fifty subjects were recruited and submitted to a complete clinical, electrophysiologic and genetic evaluation. Thirteen mutations were identified in CLCN1 and five mutations were identified in SCN4A. Onset in the lower extremities, presence of tongue myotonia and transient weakness suggested recessive CLCN1 mutations. Lid myotonia, absence of hypertrophy and exacerbation with cold temperature suggested SCN4A mutations. Pain was not a feature of dominant CLCN1 mutations while it could be seen in the others, more frequently in SCN4A mutations. Warm up phenomenon, hand grip myotonia, percussion myotonia, lid lag and hormonal effects were not distinguishing features. Repetitive nerve stimulation and short exercise test showed either a large (>50%) or mild-moderate (10-50%) decrement with recessive CLCN1 mutations while they showed only mild or no decrement with dominant CLCN1 and SCN4A mutations. The French-Canadian population shows wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity in non-dystrophic myotonias.</text></passage></document><document><id>1256</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Huntington disease-like 2: the first patient with apparent European ancestry.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of the nervous system, apparently indistinguishable from Huntington disease (HD). HDL2 is caused by the expansion above 40 CTG/CAG repeats, in a variably spliced exon of the junctophilin-3 gene, on chromosome 16q24.3. All patients described so far have been of African ancestry. A clinical evaluation, including the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, and brain Magnetic resonance imaging were achieved in a 48-year-old Brazilian man of apparent European extraction, and presenting a picture very suggestive of HD. Gene mutation analysis (HD, HDL1, HDL2, dentatorubralpallidoluysian atrophy and spinocerebellar ataxia 17) was performed. After exclusion of the HD mutation and other HDL disorders, we identified an expansion of 47 CTG/CAG at the HDL2 locus. To clarify the origin of the mutation and estimate the patient's ancestry, we performed haplotype studies and used the insertion/deletion polymorphisms method. Despite the fact that this patient had an estimated likelihood of 97.4% of being of European ancestry, the haplotype containing the expanded allele has been found only in Africans. Thus, this is the first HDL2 case reported in a patient with an apparent European ancestry, although bearing an African HDL2 haplotype. This work stresses the importance of performing the diagnosis of HDL2 in HD-like patients of various ethnicities, and particularly in highly mixed populations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1257</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Dependence of reversibility and progression of mouse neuronopathic Gaucher disease on acid beta-glucosidase residual activity levels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>Genetic and chemically induced neuronopathic mouse models of Gaucher disease were developed to facilitate understanding of the reversibility and/or progression of CNS involvement.

In kn-9H mice, progressive CNS disease and massive glucosylceramide storage in tissues led to death from CNS involvement by the age of 14 days. Conduritol B epoxide (CBE, a covalent inhibitor of GCase) treatment (for 8-12 days) of wild type, D409H, D409V or V394L homozygotes recapitulated the CNS phenotype of the kn-9H mice with seizures, tail arching, shaking, tremor, quadriparesis, extensive neuronal degeneration loss and apoptosis, and death by the age of 14 days. Minor CNS abnormalities occurred after daily CBE injections of 100 mg/kg/day for 6 doses, but neuronal degeneration was progressive and glucosylceramide storage persisted in D409V homozygotes in the 2 to 5 months after CBE cessation; wild type and D409H mice had persistent neurological damage without progression. The persistent CNS deterioration, histologic abnormalities, and glucosylceramide storage in the CBE-treated D409V mice revealed a threshold level of GCase activity necessary for the prevention of progression of CNS involvement.</text></passage></document><document><id>1258</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PCR of a VNTR linked to mucopolysaccharidosis type I and Huntington disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset></passage></document><document><id>1259</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular definition of the shortest region of deletion overlap in the Langer-Giedion syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>The Langer-Giedion syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism and skeletal abnormalities, is caused by a genetic defect in 8q24.1.

METHODS: Nine members of a pedigree from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (pedigree 971G) and 2 twins in a pedigree from Bosnia (pedigree GGO413) were diagnosed with autosomal recessive CHED and contributed DNA samples for genetic studies. The proband of each pedigree was tested for disease-causing mutations in the SLC4A11 gene with bi-directional DNA sequencing. Screening assays using restriction enzyme digests were developed to test a cohort of 99 normal control subjects for the presence of SLC4A11 mutations. RESULTS: A novel, homozygous mutation in the SLC4A11 gene (Thr271Met) was detected in the proband of pedigree 971G. Homozygous Thr271Met mutations were detected in all affected members of pedigree 971G. The Thr271Met mutation was not detected in a cohort of 99 normal control subjects. This mutation alters a highly conserved amino acid in the encoded SLC4A11 protein. No SLC4A11 mutations were detected in pedigree GGO413. CONCLUSION: A novel SLC4A11 mutation (Thr271Met) is associated with autosomal recessive CHED in a pedigree from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and provides additional support that mutations in this gene cause disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1261</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The DMPK gene of severely affected myotonic dystrophy patients is hypermethylated proximal to the largely expanded CTG repeat. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>Using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes , we characterized the methylation pattern on the 5 side of the CTG repeat in the DMPK gene of normal individuals and of patients affected with myotonic dystrophy , showing expansions of the repetitive sequence .

Two boys developed atypical hemolytic and uremic syndrome at 16 and 11 months of age, associated with low C3 and CFH levels. Both rapidly progressed to end-stage renal failure and received a kidney transplant. Patient 1 had combined CFH and complement factor I (CFI) heterozygous mutations and a membrane cofactor protein (gene symbol, CD46) gene polymorphism. Five years posttransplantation, an allograft biopsy specimen showed numerous mesangial and extramembranous C3 deposits, although the patient had no biological sign of glomerulopathy. Nine years after transplantation, he was well with stable kidney function. Patient 2, who had a homozygous CFH mutation, developed glomerulonephritis with isolated C3 deposits 5 months after kidney transplantation while he was treated for early recurrence of hemolytic anemia. Four years later, the second kidney transplant biopsy specimen showed recurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Six years posttransplantation, kidney function was stable and complete blood cell count was normal with regular plasma therapy. These observations suggest that constitutional dysregulation of the alternative pathway is associated with a wide spectrum of kidney diseases, and glomerulonephritis with isolated C3 deposits and thrombotic microangiopathy may be different expressions of the same condition. Several factors could influence the disease, such as degree of CFH haploinsufficiency and other complement alternative pathway regulator abnormalities, such as a membrane cofactor protein polymorphism.</text></passage></document><document><id>1264</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Marked variation in blood beta-hexosaminidase in Gaucher disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>Gaucher disease is due to a primary deficiency of acid beta-glucosidase activity and is associated with secondary elevations of several plasma/serum lysosomal enzyme activities, including beta-hexosaminidase.

The mean beta-hexosaminidase activity was increased and the percent of the A isozyme decreased, consistent with earlier studies. Gaucher disease patients had 2,067 +/- 1,491 nmol ml-1 h-1 units of beta-hexosaminidase activity with 51.9 +/- 15.5% beta-hexosaminidase A compared to 1,086 +/- 260 nmol ml-1 h-1 and 67.8 +/- 4.0% beta-hexosaminidase A in normal controls and 965 +/- 261 nmol ml-1 h-1 and 43.6 +/- 5.5% beta-hexosaminidase A in Tay-Sachs disease heterozygotes.

Different microsatellite expansions in two loci cause different forms of the disease that share similar features: DM1 (DM type 1) is caused by a tri- (CTG) nucleotide expansion within the DMPK (dystrophia myotonica protein kinase) 3'-untranslated region and DM2 (DM type 2) is caused by a tetra- (CCTG) nucleotide expansion within intron 1 of the ZNF9 (zinc finger 9) gene. The pathogenic mechanism of this disease involves the RNA transcribed from the expanded allele containing long tracts of (CUG)(n) or (CCUG)(n). The RNA results in a toxic effect through two RNA-binding proteins: MBNL1 (muscleblind-like 1) and CUGBP1 (CUG-binding protein 1). In DM1, MBNL1 is sequestered on CUG repeat-containing RNA resulting in its loss-of-function, while CUGBP1 is up-regulated through a signalling pathway. The downstream effects include disrupted regulation of alternative splicing, mRNA translation and mRNA stability, which contribute to the multiple features of DM1. This review will focus on the RNA gain-of-function disease mechanism, the important roles of MBNL1 and CUGBP1 in DM1, and the relevance to other RNA dominant disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>1266</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Low frequency of BRCA1 germline mutations in 45 German breast/ovarian cancer families. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>In this study we investigated 45 German breast / ovarian cancer families for germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene .

We did not observe any associations between the variants and CRC risk in the whole population. Post-menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and participants who consumed a diet low in total fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and trans fatty acids had a lower risk of CRC [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.53 (0.41, 0.68); 0.84 (0.72, 0.98); 0.72 (0.62, 0.85); 0.85 (0.73, 1.00) and 0.78 (0.67, 0.92), respectively]. This risk reduction was stronger in those homozygous for the variant APC 1822 allele with significant interaction relationships for HRT, red meat and MUFA intakes (P for interaction case-only design: 0.02, 0.002 and 0.02, respectively). Low n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake was associated with an increased CRC risk for the wild-type and heterozygous APC 1822 individuals but with a decreased CRC risk in those homozygous for the variant allele (P for interaction case-only design: 0.09). The interaction relationships with the APC 1317 variant were of the same direction though not significant, possibly due to the low frequency of the variant allele. Our results confirm the findings of three recent case-control studies suggesting a number of possible biological mechanisms. However, further large-scale studies are necessary in order to replicate these findings and confirm the role of these APC gene variants and their interaction with dietary and lifestyle exposures in colorectal carcinogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1268</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genome-wide linkage scan for colorectal cancer susceptibility genes supports linkage to chromosome 3q.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality. The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous though a strong hereditary component has been identified. However, only a small proportion of the inherited susceptibility can be ascribed to dominant syndromes, such as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) or Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). In an attempt to identify novel colorectal cancer predisposing genes, we have performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in 30 Swedish non-FAP/non-HNPCC families with a strong family history of colorectal cancer. METHODS: Statistical analysis was performed using multipoint parametric and nonparametric linkage. RESULTS: Parametric analysis under the assumption of locus homogeneity excluded any common susceptibility regions harbouring a predisposing gene for colorectal cancer. However, several loci on chromosomes 2q, 3q, 6q, and 7q with suggestive linkage were detected in the parametric analysis under the assumption of locus heterogeneity as well as in the nonparametric analysis. Among these loci, the locus on chromosome 3q21.1-q26.2 was the most consistent finding providing positive results in both parametric and nonparametric analyses Heterogeneity LOD score (HLOD) = 1.90, alpha = 0.45, Non-Parametric LOD score (NPL) = 2.1). CONCLUSION: The strongest evidence of linkage was seen for the region on chromosome 3. Interestingly, the same region has recently been reported as the most significant finding in a genome-wide analysis performed with SNP arrays; thus our results independently support the finding on chromosome 3q.</text></passage></document><document><id>1269</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The ATM gene and ataxia telangiectasia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>40</offset><text>Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chromosome instability, radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency and a predisposition for cancer.

We herein report a mutational analysis of a young afibrinogenemic man from Turkey with multiple thrombo-embolic events involving both arteries and veins. Purified DNAs of the propositus was used for amplification by polymerase chain reaction of all the exons of the A subunit gene with primers allowing the analysis of the intron-exon boundaries. Analysis of the genes coding for the three fibrinogen chains of the propositus found a homozygous G to A transition in the exon 5 of the A alpha chain gene (g.g4277a; access number gi458553). The TGG to TGA codon change predicts a homozygous W315X in the A alpha chain (p.W334X when referring to the translation initiation codon).

Despite the progress in the technologies of mutation detection, the disease of one third of patients escapes molecular definition because the labor and expense involved has precluded analyzing the entire gene. Novel techniques with higher detection rates, such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization, have been introduced. METHODS: We approached the challenge of multiplexing by modifying the PCR chemistry. We set up a rapid protocol that analyzes all dystrophin exons and flanking introns (57.5 kb). We grouped exons according to their effect on the reading frame and ran 2 PCR reactions for DMD mutations and 2 reactions for BMD mutations under the same conditions. The PCR products are evenly spaced logarithmically on the gel (Log-PCR) in an order that reproduces their chromosomal locations. This strategy enables both simultaneous mapping of all the mutation borders and distinguishing between DMD and BMD. As a proof of principle, we reexamined samples from 506 patients who had received a DMD or BMD diagnosis. RESULTS: We observed gross rearrangements in 428 of the patients (84.6%; 74.5% deletions and 10.1% duplications). We also recognized a much broader spectrum of mutations and identified 14.6% additional cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first exhaustive investigation of this subject and has made possible the development of a cost-effective test for diagnosing a larger proportion of cases. The benefit of this approach may allow more focused efforts for discovering small or deep-intronic mutations among the few remaining undiagnosed cases. The same protocol can be extended to set up Log-PCRs for other high-throughput applications.</text></passage></document><document><id>1274</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cancer after repair of esophageal atresia: population-based long-term follow-up.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Esophageal atresia (EA) predisposes to gastroesophageal reflux that is associated with intestinal metaplasia and may result in development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. To date, the literature has reported 5 cases of esophageal cancer in adult patients treated for EA. The aim of this study was to find out the incidence of esophageal cancer in adult patients with repaired EA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred two consecutive patients treated for EA from 1949 to 1978 were followed-up for cancer through the files of the population-based countrywide cancer registry from 1967 to 2004. The number of cancer cases observed and person-years at risk were counted, and the expected number of cancer cases estimated from the national cancer incidence rates. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated by dividing the number of cancer cases observed by the expected numbers. RESULTS: None of the 502 patients were lost to follow-up; 230 patients who died before 1967 younger than the median age of 8 days were excluded from further analysis. The 272 remaining patients (142 males) were eligible for follow-up (median age, 35 years; range, 2 days to 56 years). Three cases of cancer were found (SIR, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-2.8). One was lymphoma in small intestine, 1 was leukemia, and 1 carcinoma of the uterus but no cases of esophageal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is able to exclude long-term risk for esophageal cancer after repair of EA 500-fold higher than that of the normal population. Considering the relatively young age of the survivors, further studies and continued follow-up are warranted to elucidate risk for esophageal cancer and need for endoscopic surveillance after repair of EA.</text></passage></document><document><id>1275</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Contiguous deletion syndromes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>31</offset><text>In the past few years, clinical, cytogenetic and molecular analysis of patients with complex phenotypes has led to the identification of syndromes caused by deletions of adjacent disease genes on a chromosome.

METHODS: The study comprised one Norwegian and two Danish nationwide twin surveys. In 1994 and 2002, respectively, 37,388 and 46,331 Danish twin individuals were asked by questionnaire if they had AS. Similarly, in 1998, 12,718 Norwegian twins were asked if they had AS using a questionnaire phrased according to the Danish survey. Twins reporting AS were categorized according to the modified New York criteria. RESULTS: A total of 113 twin individuals reported AS, of whom 81 (72.3%) participated in validation of the diagnosis. After validation, 39 probands were diagnosed with AS. Subsequent invitation of co-twins resulted in 27 complete pairs. The point prevalence and the annual incidence of AS was 0.1% and 3/100,000 person-years (pyr) among the Danish twins. The positive predictive value of self-reported AS was 49.3%. Probandwise concordance rates on AS were (2/5) 40% in monozygotic (MZ) and (1/23) 4% in dizygotic (DZ) twins [difference 35% (95% CI 2.9-72.8), p = 0.26]. Heredity analysis including previously published and the present HLA-B27-positive twin pairs indicated that additive genetic effects account for 94% (95% CI 0.56-0.99) of the variance in the causation of AS. CONCLUSION: Self-reported AS needs careful validation. The occurrence of AS in a Danish twin population was 0.1% and accords well with previous studies on singletons in hospital settings. The present study adds to previous evidence of a major genetic effect in the pathogenesis of AS.</text></passage></document><document><id>1277</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>APC mutation spectrum in ileoanal pouch polyps resembles that of colorectal polyps.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Ileoanal pouch polyps commonly develop following restorative proctocolectomy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In FAP adenomas, the relationship between germline and somatic adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations is determined by 'just right' beta-catenin signalling in tumour cells, with respect to the 20-amino acid beta-catenin-binding/degradation repeats (20AARs) in the APC protein. However, the relationship varies, with upper gastrointestinal polyps typically retaining three to four 20AARs and colonic polyps retaining one or two. The aim of this study was to establish the mutational spectrum in ileoanal pouch polyps, to ascertain whether polyp development resembled that typical of small or large bowel. METHODS: Some 151 pouch adenomas were screened from 46 patients with known germline APC mutations for 'second hits' acquired through loss of heterozygosity and truncating mutations. The number of 20AARs remaining after the 'second hit' was calculated. RESULTS: Loss of heterozygosity was rare in pouch polyps except when the germline mutation left one 20AAR. Overall, the combined alleles left two to three 20AARs in 40 of 51 polyps with an identified 'second hit'. This was significantly fewer than in upper gastrointestinal polyps, and more than in colorectal adenomas. CONCLUSION: Tissue environment appears to influence the position of the 'second hit' in pouch polyps and the mutations resemble those of large bowel polyps.</text></passage></document><document><id>1278</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Detailed immunophenotypic characterization of different major and minor subsets of peripheral blood cells in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>160</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by a deficient expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), due to somatic mutations of the phosphatidylinositolglycan complementation Class A (PIG-A) gene. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, the expression of a high number of GPI-APs on different subsets of peripheral blood (PB) cells from 14 PNH patients and their potential association with underlying genetic abnormalities has been analyzed. RESULTS: This study confirms the existence of variable patterns of expression of different GPI-APs on both major and minor PB-cell subsets from PNH patients. The size of the PNH clone within PB neutrophils and monocytes was systematically higher than that of other cell populations. Genetic changes were detected in the PIG-A gene in 5 of 13 cases analyzed. Interestingly, the reactivity for many GPI-APs was significantly higher on different subsets of normal PB cells from PNH patients than those observed on healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: The best combination of markers for the diagnostic screening of PNH would include evaluation of CD14 on monocytes and of CD16 on neutrophils, although further analysis of CD55 and CD59 expression may contain additional clinically useful information. Clear association between the genetic changes detected in the PIG-A gene in 5 of 13 cases analyzed, and the phenotypic profile of PNH cells has not been found. Additionally, an abnormally higher expression of several GPI-APs among normal residual cells from PNH patients in comparison to healthy donors was observed, suggesting that factors other than the PIG-A mutation could determine the phenotypic profile of PB cells in PNH.</text></passage></document><document><id>1279</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Episodic ataxia: SLC1A3 and CACNB4 do not explain the apparent genetic heterogeneity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset></passage></document><document><id>1280</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Expression and mutation of myc antagonist genes Mad1, Mxi1 and Rox in leukemia cells].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and mutation of Mad1, Mxi1 and Rox genes in leukemia cells.

RESULTS: RT-PCR showed that all the above cells expressed Mad1, Mxi1 and Rox mRNA. SSCP revealed four polymorphisms: two in Mad1, one each in Mxi1 and Rox. DNA sequencing detected nine missense mutations: two in Mad1 in AL patients, four in Mxi1 (three in AL patients and one in KG-1 cell line), and three in Rox in AL patients.

It has been suggested that the particular genomic architecture of 15q11-q13 region, characterized to be flanked by low copy repeats, could predispose it to Non-Allelic Homologous Recombination (NAHR). However, no studies in gametes of fathers of PWS individuals have been published to date. The objective of the study was to assess the incidence of 15q11-q13 deletions and duplications in spermatozoa from PWS fathers and to appraise the value of the data obtained for the estimation of the risk of recurrence for the syndrome. Semen samples from 16 fathers of PWS individuals and 10 control donors, were processed by triple-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. A customized combination of probes was used to discriminate between normal, deleted and duplicated sperm genotypes. A minimum of 10,000 sperm were scored for every single sample. A significant increase in the frequency of 15q11-q13 deletions and duplications were observed in PWS fathers (0.90 +/- 0.14%) compared with control donors (0.47 +/- 0.07%). Ten out of 16 individuals contributed to this population increase (P &lt; 0.01), suggesting a predisposition for 15q11-q13 reorganizations. Statistical differences were observed in the frequency of 15q11-q13 deletions and duplications in fathers of PWS individuals (0.59 versus 0.31%; P = 0.001), indicating that intra-chromatid NAHR exchanges also substantially contribute to the rearrangements. Results demonstrated the increased susceptibility of some fathers of PWS individuals to generate 15q11-q13 deletions, suggesting that the screening of anomalies in sperm should be advisable as a valuable complement for genetic counseling.</text></passage></document><document><id>1283</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Intraepithelial bodies in colorectal adenomas: Leuchtenberger bodies revisited.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>The presence of intraepithelial inclusion bodies (Leuchtenberger bodies) was recorded in rectal or colonic specimens from 130 patients.

Conversely, none of the 55 non-FAP adenomas or of the 20 specimens with ulcerative colitis (10 with dysplasia) had similar amounts of intraepithelial granules.

The liver is a major site of iron storage and is particularly susceptible to injury from iron overload, especially when (as in primary hemochromatosis) the iron accumulates in hepatocytes. Iron can be taken up by the liver in several forms and by several pathways including: (1) receptor-mediated endocytosis of diferric or monoferric transferrin or ferritin, (2) reduction and carrier-facilitated internalization of iron from transferrin without internalization of the protein moiety of transferrin, (3) electrogenic uptake of low molecular weight, non-protein bound forms of iron, and (4) uptake of heme from heme-albumin, heme-hemopexin, or hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. Normally, pathway 2 is probably the major one for uptake of iron by hepatocytes. Iron is stored in the liver in the cores of ferritin shells and as hemosiderin, an insoluble product derived from iron-rich ferritin. Iron in hepatocytes stimulates translation of ferritin mRNA and represses transcription of DNA for transferrin and transferrin receptors. The major pathologic effects of chronic hepatic iron overload are: (1) fibrosis and cirrhosis, (2) porphyria cutanea tarda, and (3) hepatocellular carcinoma. Although precise pathogenetic mechanisms remain unknown, iron probably produces these and other toxic effects by increasing oxidative stress and lysosomal lability. Vigorous efforts at diagnosis and treatment of iron overload are essential since the pathologic effects of iron are totally preventable by early vigorous iron removal and prevention of iron re-accumulation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1285</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Behavioural and cognitive abnormalities in an imprinting centre deletion mouse model for Prader-Willi syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>The genes in the imprinted cluster on human chromosome 15q11-q13 are known to contribute to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism. Major disruptions of this interval leading to a lack of paternal allele expression give rise to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder with core symptoms of a failure to thrive in infancy and, on emergence from infancy, learning disabilities and over-eating. Individuals with PWS also display a number of behavioural problems and an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, which recent work indicates involve aspects of frontal dysfunction. To begin to examine the contribution of genes in this interval to relevant psychological and behavioural phenotypes, we exploited the imprinting centre (IC) deletion mouse model for PWS (PWS-IC(+/-)) and the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), which is primarily an assay of visuospatial attention and response control that is highly sensitive to frontal manipulations. Locomotor activity, open-field behaviour and sensorimotor gating were also assessed. PWS-IC(+/-) mice displayed reduced locomotor activity, increased acoustic startle responses and decreased prepulse inhibition of startle responses. In the 5-CSRTT, the PWS-IC(+/-) mice showed deficits in discriminative response accuracy, increased correct reaction times and increased omissions. Task manipulations confirmed that these differences were likely to be due to impaired attention. Our data recapitulate several aspects of the PWS clinical condition, including findings consistent with frontal abnormalities, and may indicate novel contributions of the imprinted genes found in 15q11-q13 to behavioural and cognitive function generally.</text></passage></document><document><id>1286</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Crystal structure of the BARD1 ankyrin repeat domain and its functional consequences.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset><text>BARD1 is the constitutive nuclear partner to the breast and ovarian cancer-specific tumor suppressor BRCA1.

We report the 2.0A structure of the BARD1 ankyrin repeat domain. The structure includes four ankyrin repeats with a non-canonical C-terminal capping ankyrin repeat and a well ordered extended loop preceding the first repeat. Conserved surface features show an acidic patch and an acidic pocket along the surface typically used by ankyrin repeat domains for binding cognate proteins. We also demonstrate that two reported mutations, N470S and V507M, in the ankyrin repeat domain do not result in observable structural defects.

X-ALD is characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; > or =C24) in plasma and tissues. In this manuscript we provide insight into the pathway underlying the elevated levels of C26:0 in X-ALD. ALDP transports VLCFacyl-CoA across the peroxisomal membrane. A deficiency in ALDP impairs peroxisomal beta-oxidation of VLCFA but also raises cytosolic levels of VLCFacyl-CoA which are substrate for further elongation. We identify ELOVL1 (elongation of very-long-chain-fatty acids) as the single elongase catalysing the synthesis of both saturated VLCFA (C26:0) and mono-unsaturated VLCFA (C26:1). ELOVL1 expression is not increased in X-ALD fibroblasts suggesting that increased levels of C26:0 result from increased substrate availability due to the primary deficiency in ALDP. Importantly, ELOVL1 knockdown reduces elongation of C22:0 to C26:0 and lowers C26:0 levels in X-ALD fibroblasts. Given the likely pathogenic effects of high C26:0 levels, our findings highlight the potential of modulating ELOVL1 activity in the treatment of X-ALD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1288</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Aberrant beta-catenin expression and adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation in ameloblastoma and odontogenic carcinoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>The Wnt pathway is involved in carcinogenesis and three regulatory genes of the Wnt pathway, APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), beta-catenin and Axin are frequently mutated in some primary human cancers.

We also performed a mutation analysis of CTNNB1 and APC to examine the cause of beta-catenin accumulation. All ameloblastoma cases and six out of eight (75%) OC cases exhibited beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus.

In 46 of the 49 Japanese deletion cases, common deletion breakpoints were located at two flanking low copy repeats (LCRs), implying that non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between LCRs is the major mechanism for the common deletion. In the other three cases of atypical deletions, the mechanism(s) of deletions remains unanswered. We characterized the atypical microdeletions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Southern blot hybridization. All the deletion breakpoints in the three cases were successfully determined at the nucleotide level. Two deletions are 1.07 Mb (SoS19) and 1.23 Mb (SoS109) in size, and another consisted of two deletions with sizes of 28 kb and 0.72 Mb, intervened by an intact 29-kb segment (SoS44). All deletions were smaller than a typical 1.9-Mb common deletion. Alu elements were identified in both deletion breakpoints in SoS19, one of deletion breakpoints in SoS109, and both deletion breakpoints of the proximal 28-kb deletion in SoS44. Alu-mediated NAHR is strongly suggested at least in two of atypical deletions. Finally, qPCR is a very useful method to determine deletion breakpoints even in repeat-related regions.</text></passage></document><document><id>1291</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Colonic polyposis and cancers of the colon.

Other genes are involved in the progression of sporadic colorectal neoplasias. Their identification would help in the comprehension of colonic carcinogenesis.

Many variants of G6PD have been described, mostly produced from missense mutations, with wide ranging levels of enzyme activity and associated clinical symptoms. METHOD: A single base extension assay is used, yielding a single base difference of the extended products. Primers are designed to amplify products of different sizes with distinct fluorescent dyes in order to accurately distinguish all possible combinations of genotypes (homozygous and heterozygous for each mutation) in a multiplex PCR analysis. RESULTS: We present the first application of a multiplex multicolour assay to detect 15 of the most frequent G6PD-related mutations in Spain, which are studied in three multiplex reactions. Capillary electrophoresis analysis of the amplified products enables easy, rapid, unambiguous and high-resolution discrimination between wild-type and mutant alleles, even though various mutations may be present in the multiplex analysis.

We report the molecular characterization of five Fabry patients including two siblings. Sequencing analysis of the alpha-galactosidase A gene coding region and intron/exon boundaries identified the new c.124A>G (p.M42V) genetic lesion as well as a known deletion in three patients, whereas in the two remaining patients, no mutations were identified. To evaluate possible alpha-galactosidase A gene transcription alterations, both predominant and alternatively spliced mRNAs were quantified by absolute real-time PCR on total RNA preparations from the patients' fibroblasts. An impressive reduction in the predominant alpha-galactosidase A transcript was detected in the last patients (Pt 4 and Pt 5). However, the alternatively spliced mRNA was dramatically overexpressed in one of them, carrying a new intronic lesion (g.9273C>T). These findings strongly suggest a correlation between this new intronic mutation and the unbalanced alpha-galactosidase A mRNAs ratio, which could therefore be responsible for the reduced enzyme activity causing Fabry disease.

Protein misfolding in lysosomal defects may have the potential to be corrected by chemical chaperones: in vitro and clinical approaches are being investigated. AIMS: We investigated the in vitro effect of galactose on some lysosomal hydrolases, and its in vitro efficacy as a chemical chaperone in GM1-gangliosidosis. METHODS: Galactose was added to the culture medium of fibroblasts from patients, controls and transfected COS-1 cells. Enzyme assays of lysosomal hydrolases, beta galactosidase in particular, were performed. RESULTS: Our data show that galactose alters selectively alpha and beta galactosidases. A significant increase (2,5 fold) in beta galactosidase activity occurred when galactose was added to the cultured fibroblasts of an adult patient. Chemical chaperone therapy requires the presence of residual enzyme activity. The adult patient here reported is heterozygous for the p.T329A mutation that showed no beta galactosidase activity, and for the p.R442Q mutation with residual enzyme activity. The p.R442Q mutation was therefore selected as a potential target for the galactose chaperone; after the addition of galactose, COS-1 cells transfected with this mutation showed an increase in beta galactosidase activity from 6.9% to 12% of control values. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that galactose or its derivatives with potential chaperone properties could be used in the development of non-invasive therapies for GM1-gangliosidosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1298</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analbuminemia in a Swedish male is caused by the Kayseri mutation (c228_229delAT).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Analbuminemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder manifested by the absence, or severe reduction, of circulating serum albumin. Here we report the first case of hereditary analbuminemia in the ethnic Swedish population, and we define the molecular defect that causes the analbuminemic trait. METHODS: Total DNA, extracted from peripheral blood samples from the analbuminemic proband and his parents, was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify the 14 exons, the exon-intron splice junctions, and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the albumin gene. The products were screened for mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analyses. The latter allowed the identification of the abnormal fragment, which was then sequenced. RESULTS: The analbuminemic trait of the proband was caused by a homozygous AT deletion at nucleotides c. 228-229, the 91st and 92nd bases of exon 3. This defect, previously identified as Kayseri mutation [M. Galliano, M. Campagnoli, A. Rossi, et al. Molecular diagnosis of analbuminemia: a novel mutation identified in two Amerindian and two Turkish families. Clin Chem 2002;48: 844-849.], produces a frameshift leading to a premature stop, two codons downstream. CONCLUSIONS: The Kayseri mutation appears to be the most common cause of analbuminemia in humans, and is found in individuals belonging to geographically distant, and apparently unrelated ethnic groups.</text></passage></document><document><id>1299</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The gene from the short arm of chromosome 3, at D3F15S2, frequently deleted in renal cell carcinoma, encodes acylpeptide hydrolase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>132</offset><text>Loss or inactivation of a gene on the short arm of chromosome 3 may contribute to the genesis of renal cell carcinoma. A gene that corresponds to the most frequently lost RFLP site (D3F15S2) is expressed in a variety of human tissues, and at a particularly high level in the kidney. Its expression is markedly reduced in renal cell carcinoma. A database search showed that the gene product is closely related to or identical with acylpeptide hydrolase. The nucleotide identity between the rat acylpeptide hydrolase and the human gene at D3F15S2 is 88%, compatible with normal species differences. It is therefore likely that the human gene product is acylpeptide hydrolase. The renal cell carcinoma is then associated with a decrease of acylpeptide hydrolase activity. The gene may represent a tumor suppressor gene, whose loss contributes to the development of renal cell carcinoma. It might be speculated that it could act e.g. by affecting the activity of a small acetylated growth factor. Alternatively, its decreased expression may merely reflect the impairment of differentiation in RCC, compared to normal kidney. Loss of a linked but irrelevant gene by the 3p deletion is another possibility.</text></passage></document><document><id>1300</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Modest reactivation of the mutant FMR1 gene by valproic acid is accompanied by histone modifications but not DNA demethylation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>128</offset><text>Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading cause of inherited mental retardation, is due to expansion and methylation of a CGG sequence in the FMR1 gene, which result in its silencing. We previously demonstrated a reactivation of FMR1 in FXS cells treated with the DNA demethylating drug 5-azadeoxycytidine, and, to a lesser extent, with the histone deacetylating drug butyrate. To identify other reactivating drugs, we now treated three FXS lymphoblastoid cell lines with valproic acid (VPA), a well-known antiepileptic drug, causing histone deacetylase inhibition and, possibly, DNA demethylation. After VPA treatment, FMR1-mRNA levels were low and FMRP protein was undetectable. The gene remained methylated, whereas histones were acetylated and a modest variation of histone methylation was observed. These results confirm the histone hyperacetylating effect of VPA but do not support its putative DNA demethylation activity. The primary role of DNA demethylation in the reactivation of the FMR1 gene was confirmed.</text></passage></document><document><id>1301</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mental health and quality of life after genetic testing for Huntington disease: a long-term effect study in Germany.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>Predictive genetic testing for Huntington disease (HD) might cause severe short-term psychological reactions in patients with poor mental health. Very few studies exist on the long-term effects of genetic HD testing. The aim of this study was to assess mental health and quality of life in persons who were tested for HD mutation, to compare mental health depending on the result of the genetic test (non-carriers, gene carriers, and patients with HD) and to identify predictors of mental health and quality of life via linear regression. The data were collected by self-report questionnaires. In total, 121 individuals participated in this study: 52 were non-carriers, 54 were gene carriers, and 15 were gene carriers suffering from HD. Non-carriers and gene carriers showed better mental health and quality of life than HD-patients but did not differ from each other. In non-carriers four variables predicted increased depression and low mental quality of life: low perceived social support, no intimate relationship, female sex and younger age. For gene carriers three predictors were found: low perceived social support, the expectation of an unfavorable genetic test result before the testing procedure and being childless. To prevent detrimental effects of HD testing on mental health and mental quality of life, specific attention should be paid to persons with limited social networks during genetic counseling. Assessment of expectations related to the test result and mental health prior to a genetic testing procedure may help to identify gene carriers at risk of poor coping after an unfavorable test result.</text></passage></document><document><id>1302</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Microutrophin delivery through rAAV6 increases lifespan and improves muscle function in dystrophic dystrophin/utrophin-deficient mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>135</offset><text>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most prevalent lethal genetic disorder in children, is caused by mutations in the 2.2-MB dystrophin gene. Absence of dystrophin and the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) from the sarcolemma leads to severe muscle wasting and eventual respiratory and/or cardiac failure. There is presently no effective therapy for DMD. Several lines of evidence have suggested that methods to increase expression of utrophin, a dystrophin paralog, show promise as a treatment for DMD. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are a promising vehicle for gene transfer to muscle, but microutrophin transgenes small enough to be carried by AAV have not been tested for function. In this study, we intravenously administered recombinant AAV (rAAV2/6) harboring a murine codon-optimized microutrophin (DeltaR4-R21/DeltaCT) transgene to adult dystrophin(-/-)/utrophin(-/-) (mdx:utrn(-/-)) double-knockout mice. Five-month-old mice demonstrated localization of microutrophin to the sarcolemma in all the muscles tested. These muscles displayed restoration of the DGC, increased myofiber size, and a considerable improvement in physiological performance when compared with untreated mdx:utrn(-/-) mice. Overall, microutrophin delivery alleviated most of the pathophysiological abnormalities associated with muscular dystrophy in the mdx:utrn(-/-) mouse model. This approach may hold promise as a treatment option for DMD because it avoids the potential immune responses that are associated with the delivery of exogenous dystrophin.</text></passage></document><document><id>1303</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The use of a new multiplex PCR assay significantly improves the rapid detection of deletions in the dystrophin gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset></passage></document><document><id>1304</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome: A rare disorder providing clues about normal tolerance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>101</offset><text>The autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is characterized by chronic, non-malignant lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity often manifesting as multilineage cytopenias, and an increased risk of lymphoma.

Most of these patients have a mutation in the gene for the TNF receptor-family member Fas (CD 95, Apo-1), and about one-third have an unknown defect or mutations affecting function of other signaling proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway. While ALPS is one of the few autoimmune diseases with a known genetic defect, there remain unanswered questions regarding how a defect in apoptosis results in the observed phenotype.

However, it has been recognized that recessive carriers may differ from noncarriers in some phenotypes. Here, we studied ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a classical recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. We compared the gene and microRNA expression phenotypes of noncarriers, AT carriers who have one copy of the ATM mutations, and AT patients with two copies of ATM mutations. We found that some phenotypes are more similar between noncarriers and AT carriers compared to AT patients, as expected for a recessive disorder. However, for some expression phenotypes, AT carriers are more similar to the patients than to the noncarriers. Analysis of one of these expression phenotypes, TNFSF4 level, allowed us to uncover a regulatory pathway where ATM regulates TNFSF4 expression through MIRN125B (also known as miR-125b or miR125b) [corrected] In AT carriers and AT patients, this pathway is disrupted. As a result, the level of MIRN125B is lower and the level of its target gene, TNFSF4, is higher than in noncarriers. A decreased level of MIRN125B is associated with breast cancer, and an elevated level of TNFSF4 is associated with atherosclerosis. Thus, our findings provide a mechanistic suggestion for the increased risk of breast cancer and heart disease in AT carriers. By integrating molecular and computational analyses of gene and microRNA expression, we show the complex consequences of a human gene mutation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1306</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel cathepsin C mutation in a Brazilian family with Papillon-Lef  vre syndrome: case report and mutation update.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>PURPOSE: Papilion-Lef  vre syndrome (PLS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that involves palmoplantar keratosis (PK) and severe aggressive periodontitis. Cathepsin C (CTSC) gene mutations are etiologic for PLS, with more than 60 different mutations reported in different ethnic groups worldwide. The purpose of this study was to report a novel cathepsin C mutation in a Brazilian patient. METHODS: A 4-year-old boy presented with aggressive periodontitis, recession, missing teeth, and hyperkeratosis of the palms of hands and soles. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from family members for genomic DNA isolation. The coding region and exon/intron boundaries of the CTSC gene were amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: The patient had a PLS phenotype, which included PK and early-onset severe periodontitis. Sequence analysis showed a novel CTSC mutation (c.267-268del) present in the homozygous state. CONCLUSION: This report described a novel mutation in a family with Brazilian Papillon-Lef  vre syndrome and presented a review of all cathepsin C (65) mutations reported to date.</text></passage></document><document><id>1307</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The microRNA pathway and fragile X mental retardation protein.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset><text>Fragile X syndrome, one of the most common forms of inherited mental retardation, is caused by the functional loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).

Recent evidence supports this view in terms of the biochemical and genetic interaction found between FMRP and the miRNA pathway, providing deeper insight into the molecular pathogenesis of mental retardation.

It is caused by mutations in the RMRP (ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA processing) gene, encoding the RNA component of the ribonuclease complex RNase MRP. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the risk and spectrum of cancer in CHH. A cohort of 123 Finnish patients with CHH (51 males) was followed for malignancy through the Finnish Cancer Registry. The number of identified cancers was compared with expected numbers of cancer using population-based data to obtain standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Hospital records were reviewed for clinical data related to the malignancies. During the follow-up (2,365 person-years; mean 19.2 years), 14 cases of cancer were diagnosed in the CHH cohort (expected number 2.0; SIR 7.0, CI 3.8-12). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was the most frequent cancer type (n = 9; SIR 90.2, CI 39.0-180) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (3), leukemia (1) and Hodgkin lymphoma (1). One tumor was not histologically classified. Nine of the 14 cancers were diagnosed in patients less than 45 years of age. In addition, ten patients had basal cell carcinoma of the skin (expected number 0.3; SIR 33.2, CI 16-61). Patients with CHH have significantly increased risk for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma or basal cell carcinoma at early age; the overall prognosis is poor. The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms remain to be elucidated in future studies. Careful follow-up, extending beyond pediatric age, is warranted for early diagnosis of malignancies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1309</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Gross deletions and translocations in human genetic disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset><text>Translocations and gross deletions constitute an important cause of both cancer and inherited disease. Such gene rearrangements are non-randomly distributed in the human genome as a consequence of selection for growth advantage and/or the inherent potential of some DNA sequences to be frequently involved in breakage and recombination. Chromosomal rearrangements are generated by a variety of recombinational processes, each characterised by mechanism-specific DNA sequence features. Various types of recombinogenic motifs have been shown to promote non-homologous end joining whilst direct repeats may mediate homologous recombination. In addition, repetitive sequence elements can facilitate the formation of secondary structure between DNA ends at translocation or gross deletion breakpoints, and in so doing, may play a role in illegitimate recombination. Although results from DNA breakpoint studies are broadly consistent with a role for homologous unequal recombination in deletion mutagenesis and a role for non-homologous recombination in the generation of translocations, homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining are unlikely to be mutually exclusive mechanisms. Thus, chromosomal rearrangements will often represent the net result of multiple highly complex molecular interactions that are not always readily explicable.</text></passage></document><document><id>1310</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An HphI-polymorphism in exon 28 of the von Willebrand factor gene, and its frequency among patients with various forms of von Willebrand's disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>148</offset><text>Besides having a large number of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) the von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene contains several sequence polymorphisms in the coding regions. Eight nucleotide substitutions have been reported in two or more independent cDNA clones. Four of them give rise to amino acid substitutions, two of which are in the mature vWF subunit (at positions 26 and 709). We have investigated a previously suggested putative alanine-threonine polymorphism at position 618 of the mature subunit in normal subjects and patients with various types of von Willebrand's disease (vWD). the codon for amino acid 618 is located in exon 28, which encodes several important vWF functional domains. We amplified the whole exon 28 and parts of it by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and distinguished gene from pseudogene sequences. The alanine----threonine (G----A) substitution was studied with restriction enzyme cleavage of the products, since it creates a new HphI site. Moreover, in two individuals we confirmed the polymorphism by cDNA sequencing. In 23 normals the frequencies of the h- (Ala) and the h+ (Thr) alleles were 0.50/0.50. In eight patients with type III vWD from seven different families, the h- allele was present in 13 of 16 genes, but whether this signifies a common mutation in some of the patients is not known. In types I and II, both alleles were present in roughly similar proportions. Owing to the high frequency of heterozygosity, the polymorphism should prove useful as an aid in genetic counselling.</text></passage></document><document><id>1311</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Association of a novel mutation in the retinol dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12) gene with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To identify the gene causing retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in an autosomal dominant pedigree. METHODS: Family members with RP were studied with linkage analysis using single-nucleotide polymorphism and short tandem repeat polymorphic markers. Candidate genes in the linked region were evaluated with DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Nineteen family members had a mild form of RP. Multipoint linkage analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes yielded a maximum nonparametric linkage score of 19.97 with markers located on chromosome 14q. LOD scores higher than 3.0 were obtained with 20 short tandem repeat polymorphic markers, and recombinants defined a 21.7-centimorgan locus on chromosome 14q. The retinol dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12) gene lies within this locus and was evaluated as a candidate gene. A frameshift mutation (776delG) was detected in all affected family members and was not detected in 158 control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous mutations in RDH12 can cause autosomal dominant RP with a late onset and relatively mild severity. This phenotype is dramatically different from the other disease associated with mutation in this gene, autosomal recessive Leber congenital amaurosis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The demonstration that mutations in a gene previously associated with recessive Leber congenital amaurosis can also cause dominant RP illustrates the wide phenotypic variability of retinal degeneration genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1312</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The genetic basis of von Willebrand disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>45</offset><text>The common autosomally inherited mucocutaneous bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD) results from quantitative or qualitative defects in plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF). Mutation can affect VWF quantity or its functions mediating platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular damage and carrying pro-coagulant factor VIII (FVIII). Phenotype and genotype analysis in patients with the three VWD types has aided understanding of VWF structure and function. Investigation of patients with specific disease types has identified mutations in up to 70% of type 1 and 100% of type 3 VWD cases. Missense mutations predominate in type 1 VWD and act through mechanisms including rapid clearance and intracellular retention. Many mutations are incompletely penetrant and attributing pathogenicity is challenging. Other factors including blood group O contribute to low VWF level. Missense mutations affecting platelet- or FVIII-binding through a number of mechanisms are responsible for the four type 2 subtypes; 2A, 2B, 2M and 2N. In contrast, mutations resulting in a lack of VWF expression predominate in recessive type 3 VWD. This review explores the genetic basis of each VWD type, relating mutations identified to disease mechanism. Additionally, utility of genetic analysis within the different disease types is explored.</text></passage></document><document><id>1313</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a link between the SAMP repeats of adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor and the Src homology 3 domain of DDEF.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein is a multifunctional protein with a well characterized role in the Wnt signal transduction pathway and in cytoskeletal regulation. The SAMP repeats region of APC, an Axin-binding site, is known to be important for tumor suppression and for the developmental function of APC. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the first SAMP motif-containing region of Xenopus APC as bait and obtained several SAMP binding candidates including DDEF2 (development and differentiation enhancing factor 2), which is an ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPase-activating protein (GAP (ArfGAP)) involved in the regulation of focal adhesions. In vitro and in cells the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of DDEF2 and its close homolog, DDEF1, are associated with the SAMP motif of APC competitively with Axin1. Moreover, NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments revealed that the SAMP motif interacts at the same surface of the SH3 domain of DDEF as the known SH3 binding motif, PXXP. When fluorescent protein-tagged APC and DDEF are expressed in Xenopus A6 cells, co-localization at microtubule ends is observed. Overexpression and RNA interference experiments indicate that APC and DDEFs cooperatively regulate the distributions of microtubules and focal adhesions. Our findings reveal that the SAMP motif of APC specifically binds to the SH3 domains of DDEFs, providing new insights into the functions of APC in cell migration.</text></passage></document><document><id>1314</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Amplification of EMSY gene in a subset of sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinomas.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) are commonly found in familial pancreatic cancer.

Amplification of EMSY occurs in 13% of sporadic breast cancers and is directly linked to increased expression. Here we investigate the amplification status of this new potential oncogene in 59 sporadic pancreatic cancers using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and tissue microarray (TMA). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed on 20 pancreatic cancer cell lines and overexpression was calculated using the delta-delta-Ct-method.

A majority of tumors were positive for IGF2, IGFBP2, IGF1R, and IGF2R and negative for IGF1 expression. However, only IGF2 showed a significant difference in expression between the ERMS and ARMS subtypes, with higher levels of expression in ERMS (P = 0.0003). Within the ARMS subtype, IGF2 positivity was limited to PAX/FKHR translocation-negative tumors. The staining pattern for all 5 proteins was diffuse cytoplasmic in the majority of tumors. Analysis of RMS cell lines by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for IGF2 expression revealed significantly higher mean expression levels in ERMS and translocation-negative ARMS cell lines when compared to translocation-positive ARMS cell lines (P = 0.0027). Stable introduction of PAX3/FKHR into an ERMS cell line also demonstrated a significant reduction in IGF2 expression. The results of this study show that expression of the IGF2 ligand is associated with translocation-negative tumors and may serve as a diagnostic aid in distinguishing RMS subtypes. Furthermore, the in vitro results are supportive of a role for the PAX3/FKHR fusion gene in the inhibition of IGF2 expression.</text></passage></document><document><id>1316</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Altered expression of transcription factors and genes regulating lipogenesis in liver and adipose tissue of mice with high fat diet-induced obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>186</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether expression of transcription factors and lipogenic enzymes is altered in liver and adipose tissue of mice with obesity, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: Mice were fed chow containing 9% of calories from standard fat (SF) or 20% of calories from high fat (HF) and killed after 9 months in the fasted or fed state. MEASUREMENTS: Liver injury was evaluated by histology and serum aminotransferase levels. Transcription factor expression was measured by real-time PCR. Lipogenic enzymes were measured by real-time PCR and Western blots. RESULTS: HF mice weighed more, had insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and focal pericellular hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, carbohydrate response element-binding protein, liver X receptor-alpha, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) decreased during fasting in SF and HF mice; however, FAS expression and protein content were higher in the liver of fasted HF mice than of fasted SF mice. In adipose tissue, expression of sterol response element-binding protein-1c, carbohydrate response element-binding protein, liver X receptor-alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, ACC, and FAS decreased with fasting in mice fed SF, but not in HF mice. ACC and FAS expression and protein content remained higher during fasting in HF than in SF mice. CONCLUSION: Feeding a nutritionally complete diet containing a moderate increase in fat produces obesity and steatohepatitis. During fasting, hepatic FAS expression and protein content are increased in HF mice. Transcription factor expression, and lipogenic enzyme expression and protein concentration do not decline during fasting in adipose tissue from HF mice. De-novo lipogenesis may persist in liver and adipose tissue during fasting in obesity/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1317</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Bone marrow transplantation in Lesch-Nyhan disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset></passage></document><document><id>1318</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Not Available].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>17</offset></passage></document><document><id>1319</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A study of HLA-G polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium in renal transplant patients and their donors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>The role of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in transplantation immunology is widely known. Incompatibilities associated with Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) between donors and recipients are related to poorer prognosis in allograft acceptance and survival, often resulting in rejection episodes. HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ compatibility are widely studied in clinical transplants but few studies investigated the influence of non-classical HLA loci, such as HLA-G, a non-classical class I HLA gene located at 6p21.31 in the MHC region, i.e. 300 kb telomeric to HLA-A. MHC region genes are characterized by extreme polymorphism as well as strong positive linkage disequilibrium (LD) between HLA loci (alleles). LD studies related to MHC region provide investigators with a tool to assess candidate genes with an at-risk HLA haplotype, with implications for allograft transplants, human reproduction and disease susceptibility. Many studies reported striking LD between HLA-G and HLAA alleles and also between HLA-G and HLA Class II alleles, but the biologicalimplications for these findings are not clear yet. DNA sequencing methodology was used to determine HLA-G (exons 2 and 3) polymorphisms from 52 patients who underwent kidney transplantation and their donors. It is the purpose of this study to investigate the influence of HLA-G polymorphism in a set of kidney transplants and the occurrence of rejection episodes. It was observed that pairs with 2 HLA-G matches presented a lower risk of rejection occurrence than those pairs with 0 or 1 match. It was also observed that subjects whose genotype presented one synonymous substitution (S) in one HLA-G allele in the HLA-G0101 group of alleles and another allele with a non-synonymous substitution (N/S) on HLA-G0103, HLA-G010401, HLA-G010403 or HLA-G0105N alleles, apparently had a greater chance of rejection episodes. Additionally, HLA-G, as well as HLA-A, -B e -DR, compatibility may also be important for allograft acceptance (rejection probability lower than 0.09%). Besides, heterozygous S/NS patients had a five times greater chance of rejection than S/S and NS/NS patients.

Although mounting evidence has indicated that BRCA1 participates in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, its precise mechanism is still unclear. Here, we analyzed the in situ response of BRCA1 at DSBs produced by laser microirradiation. The amino (N)- and carboxyl (C)-terminal fragments of BRCA1 accumulated independently at DSBs with distinct kinetics. The N-terminal BRCA1 fragment accumulated immediately after laser irradiation at DSBs and dissociated rapidly. In contrast, the C-terminal fragment of BRCA1 accumulated more slowly at DSBs but remained at the sites. Interestingly, rapid accumulation of the BRCA1 N terminus, but not the C terminus, at DSBs depended on Ku80, which functions in the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, independently of BARD1, which binds to the N terminus of BRCA1. Two small regions in the N terminus of BRCA1 independently accumulated at DSBs and interacted with Ku80. Missense mutations found within the N terminus of BRCA1 in cancers significantly changed the kinetics of its accumulation at DSBs. A P142H mutant failed to associate with Ku80 and restore resistance to irradiation in BRCA1-deficient cells. These might provide a molecular basis of the involvement of BRCA1 in the NHEJ pathway of the DSB repair process.</text></passage></document><document><id>1321</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Myotonic disorders.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>20</offset><text>Myotonia reflects a state of muscle fiber hyperexcitability. Impaired transmembrane conductance of either chloride or sodium ions results in myotonia. Myotonic disorders include the myotonic dystrophies and nondystrophic myotonias. Mutations in the genes encoding chloride (ClC-1) or sodium (SCN4A) channels expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle cause nondystrophic myotonias. Genetic defects in the myotonic dystrophies do not involve ion channel or its regulator proteins. Recent research supports a novel RNA-mediated disease mechanism of myotonia in the myotonic dystrophies. Myotonic dystrophy Type 1 is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region in the Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. Myotonic dystrophy Type 2 is caused by CCTG repeat expansion in the first intron in Zinc Finger Protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. The expanded repeat is transcribed in RNA and forms discrete inclusions in nucleus in both types of myotonic dystrophies. Mutant RNA sequesters MBNL1, a splice regulator protein and depletes MBNL1 from the nucleoplasm. Loss of MBNL1 results in altered splicing of ClC-1 mRNA. Altered splice products do not encode functional ClC-1 protein. Subsequent loss of chloride conductance in muscle membrane causes myotonia in the myotonic dystrophies. The purpose of this review is to discuss the clinical presentation, recent advances in understanding the disease mechanism with particular emphasis on myotonic dystrophies and potential therapy options in myotonic disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>1322</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Loss of INI1 expression defines a unique subset of pediatric undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Malignant rhabdoid tumor has traditionally been defined by its histologic phenotype. However, genetic investigations of malignant rhabdoid tumor have revealed a characteristic loss of or mutation in the INI1 gene on chromosome 22q. The occurrence and significance of soft tissue tumors meeting genetic criteria for malignant rhabdoid tumor but with an undifferentiated non-rhabdoid histology is poorly characterized. Seventeen undifferentiated sarcomas, lacking rhabdoid histology were identified either through the surgical pathology files of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (1980-2005) or in consultation. Immunohistochemistry for the INI1 protein showed a loss of nuclear expression within tumor cells in five of these cases. On histologic review, these five tumors had a featureless sheet-like architecture; four were small round blue cell tumors, and one showed focal spindling. Although they had variably prominent nucleoli, classic rhabdoid morphologic features were not identified in any of these cases at primary presentation. Additional immunohistochemistry showed a polyphenotypic profile. Four of the five tumors showed genetic abnormalities involving the INI1 gene by a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and/or mutational analysis. Patient ages ranged from 1 week to 5 years. Four patients were male, and one was female. Sites included two neck tumors, two extremity tumors, and one paraspinal tumor. Two patients are alive and well over 15 years from the time of diagnosis; the remaining four are alive and well but with less than 2 years follow-up. Thus, alterations of the INI1 gene with consequent loss of expression identified a population of undifferentiated sarcomas lacking classic rhabdoid morphology in young patients, with evidence of favorable survival. Whether these undifferentiated sarcomas represent a clinicopathologic entity distinct from classic malignant rhabdoid tumor requires further investigation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1323</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Niemann-Pick C1 protein transports copper to the secretory compartment from late endosomes where ATP7B resides.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>Wilson disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body by defective biliary copper excretion. Wilson disease gene product (ATP7B) functions in copper incorporation to ceruloplasmin (Cp) and biliary copper excretion. However, copper metabolism in hepatocytes has been still unclear. Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lipid storage disorder and the most commonly mutated gene is NPC1 and its gene product NPC1 is a late endosome protein and regulates intracellular vesicle traffic. In the present study, we induced NPC phenotype and examined the localization of ATP7B and secretion of holo-Cp, a copper-binding mature form of Cp. The vesicle traffic was modulated using U18666A, which induces NPC phenotype, and knock down of NPC1 by RNA interference. ATP7B colocalized with the late endosome markers, but not with the trans-Golgi network markers. U18666A and NPC1 knock down decreased holo-Cp secretion to culture medium, but did not affect the secretion of other secretory proteins. Copper accumulated in the cells after the treatment with U18666A. These findings suggest that ATP7B localizes in the late endosomes and that copper in the late endosomes is transported to the secretory compartment via NPC1-dependent pathway and incorporated into apo-Cp to form holo-Cp.</text></passage></document><document><id>1324</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hemostatic effect of normal platelet transfusion in severe von Willebrand disease patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>Platelet von Willebrand factor (vWF) has been suggested to play an important role in the hemostatic process. Clinical and experimental data indicate that bleeding time (BT) and platelet-vessel wall interaction cannot be normalized unless the defect of platelet vWF is also corrected. We have examined the effect of normal platelet concentrate transfusion 1 hour after cryoprecipitate infusion in five type III von Willebrand disease (vWD) patients. The cryoprecipitate infusion attained normal circulating levels of ristocetin cofactor, vWF antigen, and factor VIII activity. In two patients, cryoprecipitate infusion did not modify the BT (greater than 30 minutes), whereas in the remaining three patients BT was only partially corrected (from greater than 30 to 12, 18, and 21 minutes). However, the immediate platelet transfusion completely corrected the BT in four cases, and in one case it shortened the BT to 8.30 minutes (n = 3 to 8 minutes). In the perfusion study, cryoprecipitate infusion only resulted in a slight increase in platelet deposition (surface coverage range: 2.4% to 11.3%), whereas the platelet concentrate transfusion elicited a more marked improvement (range: 8.2% to 26.4%; P less than .02 v post-cryoprecipitate). These results suggest an important in vivo role of the platelet vWF in supporting platelet-vessel wall interaction. They also give support to the occasional addition of normal platelet transfusion to the cryoprecipitate infusion for the control of serious bleeding episodes resistant to cryoprecipitate in severe vWD patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1325</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Atp7b-/- mice as a model for studies of Wilson's disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>58</offset><text>Wilson's disease is a severe human disorder of copper homoeostasis.

The most frequent disease manifestations include a wide spectrum of liver pathologies as well as neurological and psychiatric abnormalities. A combination of copper chelators and zinc therapy has been used to prevent disease progression; however, accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease remains challenging. Similarly, side effects of treatments are common. To understand better the biochemical and cellular basis of Wilson's disease, several animal models have been developed.

METHODS: This study was conducted at the department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi from 2003 to 2007, having 75 patients. The information collected included age, education, and self perceived state of socio-economic class, presenting clinical signs and symptoms, basic and specific laboratory investigations. The disease was staged from I to IV upon surgical staging and the type of cancer was determined by histopathological examination. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 51 +/- 12.3 years. Twenty (52%) patients were uneducated, 17 (22.6%) were below and remaining 19 (25.3%) were above higher secondary level. Most of the patients belonged to the middle socioeconomic class. Abdominal pain (57.3%) was the most common presenting symptom followed by abdominal distension (22.6%), urinary complaints (5.3%), vaginal discharge (2.6%) and postmenopausal bleeding (12%). More than half (56%) of the patients had stage III-IV disease. On histology, papillary serous cystic adenocarcinoma was the most common (54%) type followed by mucinious (22%), endometroid (10.6%), yolk sac (2.6%), dysgerminoma (4%), and adult granulose cell tumour (5.3%). CONCLUSION: There are no specific ovarian carcinoma symptoms either in early or late stages to ensure early diagnosis, but in the age group above 40 years persistent clinical symptoms should always be further investigated.</text></passage></document><document><id>1327</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Construction of an adenoassociated, viral derived, expression vector to correct the genetic defect in Morquio A disease].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>123</offset><text>INTRODUCTION: Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio A) is caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphate-sulphatase, a lysosomal enzyme required for the stepwise degradation of keratan-sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. A deficiency in this enzyme results in an accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in several tissues. Currently, no effective therapies exist and only supportive measures are used to treat some manifestations of the disease. An ideal therapy is one that can be administrated early in life, has low mortality, and leads to long-term expression of the enzyme. Gene therapy emerges as a potential alternative to correct the genetic defect in MPS IVA. OBJECTIVE: Adenoassociated virus-derived expression vectors (AAV) were constructed to correct in vitro the enzyme deficiency in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adenoasociated virus-derived vectors containing the human GALNS gene and driven by the citomegalivirus immedited-early promoter were constructed using a free-adenoviral protocol. HEK293 cells and human skin Morquio A fibroblasts were transfected with the recombinat vectors. Enzyme activity was measured in cells 24 and 48 hours post-transfection. RESULTS: Free-adenovirus recombinant AAV vectors were obtained with titres up to 2.08x1010 capsids/mL. HEK293 cells and Morquio A fibroblasts transfected with vectors showed GALNS activity up to 3.05 nmoles/mg/h 48 hours post-transfection. CONCLUSION: The AAV mediated the in vitro expression of GALNS enzyme in the transfected cells. These results are the first step towards a gene therapy alternative to Morquio A disease using adenoassociated virus-derived vectors.</text></passage></document><document><id>1328</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Spinocerebellar ataxias types 1, 2 and 3: age adjusted clinical severity of disease at presentation correlates with size of CAG repeat lengths.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>144</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the correlation, if any, between the clinical rate of disease progression at presentation with the CAG repeat size in patients with spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2 and 3 (SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3). METHODS: The severity of ataxia was measured using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (IARS) in 31 patients of SCA1 (mean+/-SD age: 35.1+/-12.6 years; age at onset (AAO): 29.9+/-10.7 years), 25 patients of SCA2 (age: 34.9+/-14.9 years; AAO: 29.7+/-14.0 years) and 15 patients of SCA3 (age: 40.9+/-8.6 years; AAO: 36.9+/-10.1). The rate of disease progression at presentation was measured by the age adjusted IARS (IARS/Age). For each SCA, correlations of AAO, raw scores of IARS, age adjusted IARS and duration adjusted IARS (IARS/Duration) with the CAG repeat size were determined. RESULTS: The number of CAG repeats of the abnormal allele ranged from 42 to 67 in SCA1, 38 to 66 in SCA2, and 69 to 79 in SCA3. In all the three types of SCAs, there were significant inverse correlations of AAO with CAG repeat size (SCA1: r=-0.9, p&lt;0.0001; SCA2: r=-0.7, p&lt;0.0001; SCA3:-0.8, p=0.0003) and significant positive correlations of IARS/Age with CAG repeat size (SCA1: r=0.6, p=0.0015; SCA2: r=0.9, p&lt;0.0001; SCA3:0.7, p=0.0057). However, the raw IARS scores and the duration adjusted IARS scores did not correlate significantly with the CAG repeat sizes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the rate of clinical disease progression at presentation, especially in SCA2, is dependent on the CAG repeat size, and may commence linearly from birth.</text></passage></document><document><id>1329</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Intraoperative preservation of corticospinal function in the brainstem.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>BACKGROUND: The corticospinal tract features a largely exposed course through the brainstem, and is therefore at risk in many brainstem-related procedures. No large case series on motor-evoked potential (MEP) monitoring during brainstem surgery have been reported as yet. OBJECTIVE: To understand intraoperative MEP changes during brainstem-related surgery, and to explore the value of MEP monitoring for preventing permanent new paresis. METHODS: Myogenic MEPs after transcranial electrical train stimulation were monitored in 70 cases of intraparenchymal (n = 39) and extraparenchymal (n = 31) brainstem-related tumours and vascular lesions. MEP recordings failed in another five cases. Motor outcome and intraoperative MEP results were documented prospectively and correlated for this study. RESULTS: Significant MEP changes occurred in 46% of cases. Stable and only reversibly deteriorated MEPs warranted unimpaired motor outcome (n = 50, 71% of all cases). Irreversible deterioration and reversible loss (n = 19, 27%) indicated a 37% risk for transient deficit. Irreversible loss (one case, 1.5%) predicted permanent paresis. MEPs and motor outcome correlated equally well in intra- and extraparenchymal lesions. Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) did not reliably reflect motor outcome. Permanent motor deficit occurred in one out five cases (20%) with failed MEP recordings. CONCLUSIONS: MEP monitoring-as opposed to SEPs-is a valid indicator of corticospinal function in brainstem-related surgery, independent from the type of lesion operated on. New deficit occurs only after more pronounced MEP changes than in supratentorial surgery, but complete loss as in spinal surgery is not required. MEPs may help to prevent permanent new paresis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1330</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Clinical and biochemical heterogenicity of phenylketonuria in adults].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>The authors carried out a clinical and biochemical investigation of 23 phenylketonuric patients at the age of 17--49 who were not treated specifically.

There is strong evidence for the role of the MBNL1 gene in disease pathology, but the roles of two related genes, MBNL2 and MBNL3, are less clear. Using new monoclonal antibodies specific for each of the three gene products, we found that MBNL2 decreased during human fetal development and myoblast culture, while MBNL1 was unchanged. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy muscle, MBNL2 was elevated in immature, regenerating fibres compared with mature fibres, supporting some developmental role for MBNL2. MBNL3 was found only in C2C12 mouse myoblasts. Both MBNL1 and MBNL2 were partially sequestered by nuclear foci of expanded repeats in adult muscle and cultured cells from myotonic dystrophy patients. In adult muscle nucleoplasm, both proteins were reduced in myotonic dystrophy type 1 compared with an age-matched control. In normal human myoblast cultures, MBNL1 and MBNL2 always co-distributed but their distribution could change rapidly from nucleoplasmic to cytoplasmic. Functional differences between MBNL1 and MBNL2 have not yet been found and may prove quite subtle. The dominance of MBNL1 in mature, striated muscle would explain why ablation of the mouse mbnl1 gene alone is sufficient to cause a myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage></document><document><id>1332</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic mapping of the copper toxicosis locus in Bedlington terriers to dog chromosome 10, in a region syntenic to human chromosome region 2p13-p16. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>149</offset><text>Abnormal hepatic copper accumulation is recognized as an inherited disorder in man , mouse , rat and dog .

We also performed a genome-wide scan to identify novel loci. METHODS: Twenty-six families, with at least two high-myopic subjects (ie. refractive value in the less affected eye of -5 diopters) in each family, were included. Phenotypic examination included standard autorefractometry, ultrasonographic eye length measurement, and clinical confirmation of the non-syndromic character of the refractive disorder. Nine families were collected de novo including 136 available members of whom 34 were highly myopic subjects. Twenty new subjects were added in 5 of the 17 remaining families. A total of 233 subjects were submitted to a genome scan using ABI linkage mapping set LMSv2-MD-10, additional markers in all regions where preliminary LOD scores were greater than 1.5 were used. Multipoint parametric and non-parametric analyses were conducted with the software packages Genehunter 2.0 and Merlin 1.0.1. Two autosomal recessive, two autosomal dominant, and four autosomal additive models were used in the parametric linkage analyses. RESULTS: No linkage was found using the subset of nine newly collected families. Study of the entire population of 26 families with a parametric model did not yield a significant LOD score (>3), even for the previously suggestive locus on 7q36. A non-parametric model demonstrated significant linkage to chromosome 7p15 in the entire population (Z-NPL=4.07, p=0.00002). The interval is 7.81 centiMorgans (cM) between markers D7S2458 and D7S2515. CONCLUSIONS: The significant interval reported here needs confirmation in other cohorts. Among possible susceptibility genes in the interval, certain candidates are likely to be involved in eye growth and development.</text></passage></document><document><id>1334</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Not for the eyes only: PAX6 and glucose metabolism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset></passage></document><document><id>1335</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>114</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults , is caused by ( CTG ) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase ( DM protein kinase ; DMPK ) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis . To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis , we have compared the resting [ Ca2 + ] i , the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2 + transients , and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK [ - / - ] knockout mice . In vitro-differentiated DMPK [ - / - ] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ Ca2 + ] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels . The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K + . In addition , we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l-type Ca2 + channel .

To determine the region linked to the Class III phenotype in four Hispanic families, we performed a genome-wide scan and linkage analysis using 500 microsatellite markers. Pedigree and linkage analyses revealed that the Class III phenotype (primarily maxillary deficiency) segregates in an autosomal-dominant manner, and that 5 loci (1p22.1, 3q26.2, 11q22, 12q13.13, and 12q23) are suggestive of linkage.

Annual incidence of recurrence was estimated in 130 deficient patients, with separate estimates for those with each of protein S, protein C, and antithrombin deficiency, and in eight non-deficient patients with prior venous thromboembolism. All patients were also tested for factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, high levels of factors VIII, IX and XI, and hyperhomocysteinemia. There were 81 recurrent events among 130 deficient patients. Median follow-up was 4.6 years. Annual incidences (95% confidence interval) of recurrent venous thromboembolism were 8.4% (5.8-11.7) for protein S deficiency, 6.0% (3.9-8.7) for protein C deficiency, 10.0% (6.1-15.4) for antithrombin deficiency, and overall 7.7% (6.1-9.5). Relative risk of recurrence in patients with a spontaneous versus provoked first event was 1.5 (0.95-2.3). Cumulative recurrence rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 15%, 38% and 53%. Relative risk of recurrence with concomitant defects was 1.4 (0.7-2.6) (1 defect) and 1.4 (0.8-2.7) (> or =2 defects). Annual incidence was 1.0% (0.03-5.5) in eight non-deficient patients. Annual incidence of major bleeding in deficient patients on oral anticoagulant treatment was 0.5% (0.2-1.0). We conclude that patients with a hereditary protein S, protein C or antithrombin deficiency appear to have a high absolute risk of recurrence. This risk is increased after a first spontaneous event, and by concomitance of other thrombophilic defects.</text></passage></document><document><id>1339</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Distribution of emerin and lamins in the heart and implications for Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>Emerin is a nuclear membrane protein which is missing or defective in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) .

Several mAbs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart , though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly , both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels .

Although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei , it was absent from many non-myocyte cells in the heart . This distribution of emerin was similar to that of lamin A , a candidate gene for an autosomal form of EDMD . In contrast , lamin B1 was absent from cardiomyocyte nuclei , showing that lamin B1 is not essential for localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina .

It is caused by deficiency of paternally expressed transcript(s) within the human chromosome region 15q11.2. PWS patients harboring balanced chromosomal translocations with breakpoints within small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) have provided indirect evidence for a role for the imprinted C/D box containing small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes encoded downstream of SNRPN. In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology. In this study, we performed detailed phenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses including chromosome analysis, array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), expression studies, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for parent-of-origin determination of the 15q11.2 microdeletion on an 11-year-old child expressing the major components of the PWS phenotype. This child had an    236.29   kb microdeletion at 15q11.2 within the larger Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region that included the SNORD116 cluster of snoRNAs. Analysis of SNP genotypes in proband and mother provided evidence in support of the deletion being on the paternal chromosome 15. This child also met most of the major PWS diagnostic criteria including infantile hypotonia, early-onset morbid obesity, and hypogonadism. Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis. Array CGH testing for genomic copy-number changes in cases with complex phenotypes is proving to be invaluable in detecting novel alterations and enabling better genotype-phenotype correlations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1341</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Abnormal bradykinin signalling in fibroblasts deficient in the PIP(2) 5-phosphatase, ocrl1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (Lowe syndrome) is an X-linked disorder of phosphatidylinositol metabolism characterized by congenital cataracts, renal proximal tubulopathy and neurological deficits. The disorder is due to the deficiency of the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) 5-phosphatase, ocrl1. PIP(2) is critical for numerous cellular processes, including cell signalling, actin reorganization and protein trafficking, and is chronically elevated in patients with Lowe syndrome. The elevation of PIP(2) cells of patients with Lowe syndrome provides the unique opportunity to investigate the roles of this phospholipid in fundamental cellular processes. We previously demonstrated that ocrl1 deficiency causes alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. Since actin remodelling is strongly activated by [Ca(+2)], which increases in response to IP(3) production, we hypothesized that altered calcium signalling might contribute to the observed abnormalities in actin organization. Here we report a specific increase in bradykinin-induced Ca(+2) mobilization in Lowe fibroblasts. We show that the abnormal bradykinin signalling occurs in spite of normal total cellular receptor content. These data point to a novel role for ocrl1 in agonist-induced calcium release.</text></passage></document><document><id>1342</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Determination of alpha 1-antitrypsin levels and of the presence of S and Z alleles in a population of patients with chronic respiratory symptoms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>146</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To determine the levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) and the presence of S and Z alleles in patients with chronic respiratory symptoms. METHODS: Patients with chronic cough and dyspnea were submitted to clinical evaluation, pulmonary function tests, high-resolution computed tomography, nephelometric determination of AAT and determination of S and Z alleles by polymerase chain reaction. Smoking and AAT levels were considered the dependent variables. RESULTS: Of the 89 patients included in the study, 44 were female. The mean age was 51.3 +/- 18.2 years. The S and Z alleles were detected in 33.3% and 5.7%, respectively, and the gene frequency was 0.16 and 0.028, respectively. Two patients were SZ heterozygotes (AAT levels &lt; 89 mg/dL). The patients were divided into groups based on AAT level: &lt; 89 mg/dL (deficiency, no group); 90-140 mg/dL (intermediate, Group 1, n = 30); and > 141 mg/dL (normal, Group 2, n = 57). The frequency of smokers was the same in both groups, although tobacco intake was greater in Group 2. The S allele was present in 13 and 14 patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, whereas the Z allele was present in 2 and 1 patient in the same groups. There was no difference in the results of pulmonary function tests or in the frequency of bronchiectasis or emphysema between the two groups. Spirometric values and AAT levels were similar in smokers and nonsmokers. Bronchiectasis was more common in nonsmokers, and emphysema was more common in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty patients presented AAT levels lower than the mean values found in patients with the MM or MS genotype, and this fact could not be explained by an increased frequency of S and Z alleles.</text></passage></document><document><id>1343</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Infantile nystagmus and late onset ataxia associated with a CACNA1A mutation in the intracellular loop between s4 and s5 of domain 3.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>134</offset><text>PURPOSE: Mutations in the 1A-subunit of the brain P/Q-type calcium channel gene CACNA1A are responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), familial haemiplegic migraine (FHM) and episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2). Considerable clinical and genetic overlap exists between these 3 allelic disorders. Clinical findings are varied and may include nystagmus. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical phenotype and identify a causative mutation in a family who presented when the youngest member was diagnosed with apparent isolated congenital nystagmus (age 3 months). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 8 patients from one family underwent detailed clinical phenotyping comprising; ophthalmic and neurological examination, nystagmology, electrodiagnostic tests and brain imaging. The CACNA1A gene was screened for mutations by direct sequencing in one patient. Co-segregation of the disease and an identified sequence variation was shown using direct sequencing. RESULTS: Phenotyping revealed isolated atypical nystagmus in 4 family members and nystagmus in addition to late onset ataxia in 1 family member. Direct sequencing of the CACNA1A gene identified a novel missense mutation; (c.4110T>G p.Phe1370Leu (NM_000068.3)). CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that a mutation in the intracellular domain between s4 and s5 of repeat 3 can cause atypical nystagmus/cerebellar phenotypes, including isolated nystagmus in an infant. We also illustrate the necessity for detailed examination of relatives in cases of apparent isolated congenital nystagmus.</text></passage></document><document><id>1344</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hereditary and acquired complement dysregulation in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a chronic progressive renal disease that is diagnosed on the basis of renal histological features. Several MPGN subtypes have been defined by the localization and composition of glomerular deposits (electron dense, Ig and C3). MPGN II or dense deposit disease (DDD) which is defined by the occurrence of electron dense deposits within the lamina densa of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is strongly associated with dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway (AP). However, C3 Nephritic Factor (C3NeF), an autoantibody against the alternative C3 convertase C3bBb, and mutations in regulatory proteins of the AP have also been identified in other subtypes of MPGN and even in glomerulonephritis with mesangial C3 deposits. Clinically, MPGN is characterized by proteinuria (up to nephrotic range) and hypertension, frequent progression to end-stage kidney disease and disease recurrence after renal transplantation. The age of onset varies from childhood to adulthood. In the following we will review our current knowledge of pathogenesis of MPGN and will present a novel classification system of the disease based on pathogenesis rather than on morphology. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of MPGN is crucial for the development of novel, specific treatment strategies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1345</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Atypical presentation of VLCAD deficiency associated with a novel ACADVL splicing mutation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids with a chain length between 14 and 18 carbons.

We report a 20-year-old female with VLCAD deficiency who first presented in infancy with hypoketotic hypoglycemia. In childhood the patient developed complex partial seizures that were aggravated by Lamotrigine treatment. The clinical course in early adulthood was complicated by recurrent, often unprovoked, episodes of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. In addition, she suffered from chronic myalgia, muscle weakness, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. A muscle biopsy revealed accumulation of fat droplets. Her acylcarnitine profile showed significantly elevated C14, C14:1, C16, and C18-carnitines. Sequence analysis of ACADVL revealed a heterozygous recurrent mutation c.848T>C (p.V283A) and a heterozygous novel splice mutation c.879-8T>A that results in the inclusion of six nucleotides from intron 9 into the transcript sequence.

In addition, numerous intronic mutations with uncertain effects on pre-mRNA splicing have also been identified. In this study, we have selected 18 intronic mutations in the LDLR gene for comprehensive studies of their effects on pre-mRNA splicing. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphocytes from subjects heterozygous for these mutations were established and mRNA was studied by Northern blot analyses and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions. Furthermore, functional studies of the LDLRs were performed by flow cytometry. The results of the wet-lab analyses were compared to the predictions obtained from bioinformatics analyses using the programs MaxEntScan, NetGene2 and NNSplice 0.9, which are commonly used software packages for prediction of abnormal splice sites. Thirteen of the 18 intronic mutations were found to affect pre-mRNA splicing in a biologically relevant way as determined by wet-lab analyses. Skipping of one or two exons was observed for eight of the mutations, intron inclusion was observed for four of the mutations and activation of a cryptic splice site was observed for two of the mutations. Transcripts from eight of the mutant alleles were subjected to degradation. The computational analyses of the normal and mutant splice sites, predicted abnormal splicing with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 60%. Thus, bioinformatics analyses are valuable tools as a first screening of the effects of intronic mutations in the LDLR gene on pre-mRNA splicing.</text></passage></document><document><id>1347</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A frailty-model-based approach to estimating the age-dependent penetrance function of candidate genes using population-based case-control study designs: an application to data on the BRCA1 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>195</offset><text>The population-based case-control study design is perhaps one of, if not the most, commonly used designs for investigating the genetic and environmental contributions to disease risk in epidemiological studies. Ages at onset and disease status of family members are routinely and systematically collected from the participants in this design. Considering age at onset in relatives as an outcome, this article is focused on using the family history information to obtain the hazard function, i.e., age-dependent penetrance function, of candidate genes from case-control studies. A frailty-model-based approach is proposed to accommodate the shared risk among family members that is not accounted for by observed risk factors. This approach is further extended to accommodate missing genotypes in family members and a two-phase case-control sampling design. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in realistic settings. Finally, a population-based two-phase case-control breast cancer study of the BRCA1 gene is used to illustrate the method.</text></passage></document><document><id>1348</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular heterogeneity in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA in Australia and Northern Ireland: nine novel mutations including T312S, a common allele that confers a mild phenotype. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>173</offset><text>Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA ( MPS IVA ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a genetic defect in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase ( GALNS ) . Previous studies of patients from a British-Irish population showed that the I113F mutation is the most common single mutation among MPS IVA patients and produces a severe clinical phenotype . We studied mutations in the GALNS gene from 23 additional MPS IVA patients ( 15 from Australia , 8 from Northern Ireland ) , with various clinical phenotypes ( severe , 16 cases ; intermediate , 4 cases ; mild , 3 cases ) . We found two common mutations that together accounted for 32 % of the 44 unrelated alleles in these patients . One is the T312S mutation , a novel mutation found exclusively in milder patients . The other is the previously described I113F that produces a severe phenotype . The I113F and T312S mutations accounted for 8 ( 18 % ) and 6 ( 14 % ) of 44 unrelated alleles , respectively . The relatively high residual GALNS activity seen when the T312S mutant cDNA is overexpressed in mutant cells provides an explanation for the mild phenotype in patients with this mutation . The distribution and relative frequencies of the I113F and T312S mutations in Australia corresponded to those observed in Northern Ireland and are unique to these two populations , suggesting that both mutations were probably introduced to Australia by Irish migrants during the 19th century . Haplotype analysis using 6 RFLPs provides additional data that the I113F mutation originated from a common ancestor . The other 9 novel mutations identified in these 23 patients were each limited to a single family . These data provide further evidence for extensive allelic heterogeneity in MPS IVA in British-Irish patients and provide evidence for their transmission to Australia by British-Irish migrants . . </text></passage></document><document><id>1349</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>MEFV mutations in Japanese rheumatoid arthritis patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>58</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Familiar Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is common among Mediterranean populations, while other populations are rarely affected. The aim of this study was to assess the involvement of MEFV gene mutations among Japanese rheumatoid arthritis patients with or without amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis. METHODS: The frequency of the MEFV mutations, which were identified in Japanese FMF patients, was determined in 126 Japanese RA patients and 76 Japanese healthy subjects. RESULTS: The M694I mutation was not observed among RA patients and healthy subjects. Allele frequency of R408Q, P369S, E148Q, L110P mutations account respectively for 3.3%, 3.9%, 23.7%, 9.2% in healthy subjects and 5.6%, 6.7%, 24.2%, 9.5% in RA patients. The overall mutation rate was comparable between the RA patients and healthy subjects, as well as between the RA patients with and without amyloidosis. CONCLUSION: This study shows the high prevalence of mutations of the MEFV genes in Japanese RA patients. However, our data suggest that the MEFV gene mutations may not be a genetic factor affecting the susceptibility of RA or the development of amyloidosis in a Japanese population.</text></passage></document><document><id>1350</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular population genetics of SLC4A1 and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is an erythrocyte abnormality that protects affected individuals from cerebral malaria. This trait is caused by a 27-bp deletion in the SLC4A1 gene, which is lethal when homozygous. We reseqeunced approximately 5 kb of SLC4A1 in an Indonesian population where SAO is prevalent to better understand the evolution of this clinically important trait. The four SAO chromosomes we resequenced share a single haplotype that differs from a sampled non-SAO haplotype only by the 27-bp deletion. Comparison of Indonesian sequence data to that from two other Asian populations (aboriginal Taiwanese and Japanese) shows Indonesian SLC4A1 to be strongly differentiated from the Taiwanese, but not the Japanese. Indeed, the Taiwanese sample contains only chromosomes that are highly divergent from all sampled SAO chromosomes. Because earlier studies have found an association between Austronesian-speakers (who most likely originated in Taiwan) and SAO, our failure to find SAO-like chromosomes in Taiwan is unexpected. Finally, our data find a strong excess of high-frequency derived alleles in all three populations. These alleles include the non-synonymous 'Memphis' variant, which is known to affect anion transport across the erythrocyte membrane. Our data suggest a role for recent natural selection acting on Memphis or a linked variant.</text></passage></document><document><id>1351</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the proteolipid protein gene (PLP) in a family with an unusual form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>132</offset><text>We report a G-- > A transition at nucleotide 431 of the proteolipid protein gene ( PLP ) results in a nonsense codon in a family with an unusual form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) .

Although the cut-off for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) has recently been changed from 110 (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l), it does not seem a reliable way to find all subjects with impaired glucose homeostasis. The aim of our study was to determine whether high-normal fasting glucose level could predict the occurrence of IGT and metabolic syndrome. Three hundred and twenty-three Italian obese children and adolescents were included in the study (176 females, mean age 11+/-2.9 yr; mean body mass index z-score: 3+/-0.6). Waist circumference, serum glucose, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol HDL, blood pressure were evaluated and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. The prevalence of IFG and IGT were respectively 1.5% (5 subjects) and 5% (18 patients); no diabetic patients were found. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 20% of patients. Fasting glycemia values &lt;100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) have been divided in quintiles. Metabolic syndrome prevalence increased across quintiles, although not in a statistically significantly manner, but it could depend on the selected diagnostic criteria as no univocal definition exists for metabolic syndrome in youths. Interestingly high-normal fasting plasma glucose levels constitute an independent risk factor for IGT among obese children and adolescents; therefore, this very easy-to-use parameter may help to identify obese patients at increased risk of diabetes or at least could suggest in which subjects to perform an OGTT.</text></passage></document><document><id>1353</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever in Syrian patients: MEFV gene mutations and genotype-phenotype correlation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>Familial Mediterranean fever is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of abdominal pain, synovitis and pleuritis.

The encoded protein, p16(INK4A), comprises four ankyrin-type repeats, and the mutations, most of which are missense and occur throughout the entire coding region, can disrupt the conformation of these structural motifs as well as the association of p16(INK4a) with its physiological targets, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) CDK4 and CDK6. Assessing pathogenicity of nonsynonymous mutations is critical to evaluate melanoma risk in carriers. In the current study, we investigate 20 CDKN2A germline mutations whose effects on p16(INK4A) structure and function have not been previously documented (Thr18_Ala19dup, Gly23Asp, Arg24Gln, Gly35Ala, Gly35Val, Ala57Val, Ala60Val, Ala60Arg, Leu65dup, Gly67Arg, Gly67_Asn71del, Glu69Gly, Asp74Tyr, Thr77Pro, Arg80Pro, Pro81Thr, Arg87Trp, Leu97Arg, Arg99Pro, and [Leu113Leu;Pro114Ser]). By considering genetic information, the predicted impact of each variant on the protein structure, its ability to interact with CDK4 and impede cell proliferation in experimental settings, we conclude that 18 of the 20 CDKN2A variants can be classed as loss of function mutations, whereas the results for two remain ambiguous. Discriminating between mutant and neutral variants of p16(INK4A) not only adds to our understanding of the functionally critical residues in the protein but provides information that can be used for melanoma risk prediction.</text></passage></document><document><id>1355</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Constitutively methylated CpG dinucleotides as mutation hot spots in the retinoblastoma gene (RB1). </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>A wide spectrum of mutations , ranging from point mutations to large deletions , have been described in the retinoblastoma gene ( RB1 ) .

In addition, the relative risk (RR) of cancer in patients compared with age-, sex-, and ethnic-group adjusted national rates of cancer was determined. Of the 403 patients, 54% of patients were homozygous (N370S/N370S) and 46% were compound heterozygous for the N370S mutation (N370S/other). The majority of N370S/N370S patients displayed a phenotype characterized by late onset, predominantly skeletal disease, whereas the majority of N370S/other patients displayed early onset, predominantly visceral/hematologic disease, P &lt; 0.0001. There was a striking increase in lifetime risk of multiple myeloma in the entire cohort (RR 25, 95% CI 9.17-54.40), mostly confined to N370S homozygous patients. The risk of other hematologic malignancies (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.49-6.79), and overall cancer risk (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.32-2.40) was increased. Homozygous N370S GD leads to adult-onset progressive skeletal disease with relative sparing of the viscera, a strikingly high risk of multiple myeloma, and an increased risk of other cancers. High incidence of gammopathy suggests an important role of the adaptive immune system in the development of GD. Adult patients with GD should be monitored for skeletal disease and cancers including multiple myeloma.</text></passage></document><document><id>1357</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The silent mutation nucleotide 744 G --> A, Lys172Lys, in exon 6 of BRCA2 results in exon skipping.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>Germ-line mutations in BRCA2 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer.

Wilms tumor is also genetically heterogeneous and is associated with mutations of WT1 (15-20%), WTX (20-30%) and other loci. The boy presented at 5 months with failure to thrive, polyuria, hypernatremia and abdominal mass. Analysis of leukocyte DNA showed a novel missense mutation (Q174H) of the AVPR2 gene, which was not present in his mother. In cells (WitS) isolated from the tumor, WTX mRNA expression and coding sequence were intact. However, we identified a 44-kb homozygous deletion of the WT1 gene spanning exons 4 to 10. The WT1 deletion was not present in leukocyte DNA from the patient or his mother. We also noted strong beta-catenin (CTNNB1) expression in the tumor cells and identified a heterozygote missense Ser45Cys mutation of exon 3 of CTNNB1. However, the mutation was absent both in the constitutional DNA of the patient and his mother. The concurrence of WT and NDI has not been previously reported and may be unrelated.

By 1 year , these mice have no behavioral abnormalities and morphometric analysis at 6 ( one animal ) and 9 ( two animals ) months age revealed no changes . Despite high levels of mRNA expression , there was no evidence of the HD gene product in any of these transgenic mice . In vitro transfection studies indicated that the inclusion of 120 bp of the 5 UTR in the cDNA construct and the presence of a frameshift mutation at nucleotide 2349 prevented expression of the HD cDNA . These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of HD is not mediated through DNA-protein interaction and that presence of the RNA transcript with an expanded CAG repeat is insufficient to cause the disease . Rather , translation of the CAG is crucial for the pathogenesis of HD . In contrast to that seen in humans , the CAG repeat in these mice was remarkably stable in 97 meioses . This suggests that genomic sequences may play a critical role in influencing repeat instability . . </text></passage></document><document><id>1362</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Role of genetic polymorphisms and ovarian cancer susceptibility.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>The value of identifying women with an inherited predisposition to epithelial ovarian cancer has become readily apparent with the identification of the BRCA1, and BRCA2 genes. Women who inherit a deleterious mutation in either of these genes have a very high lifetime risk of ovarian cancer (10-60%) and to some extent, increased risks of fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer. These highly lethal cancers are almost completely prevented by prophylactic salpingoophorectomy. BRCA1/2 mutation testing has become the accepted standard of care in families with a strong history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. This approach has the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality by about 10%. Although the ability to perform genetic testing for BRCA1 and 2 represents a significant clinical advance, the frequency of mutations in these high penetrance ovarian cancer susceptibility genes is low in most populations. There is evidence to suggest that ovarian cancer susceptibility might be affected by common low penetrance genetic polymorphisms like it was shown for several common disorders like diabetes or breast cancer. Although such polymorphisms would increase risk to a lesser degree, they could contribute to the development of a greater proportion of ovarian cancers by virtue of their higher frequencies in the population. It has been shown that the most powerful approach to studying low penetrance genes is an association study rather than a linkage study design. This review describes the efforts that have been made in this field by individual case-control studies and through multi-center collaborations as part of international consortia such as the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC).</text></passage></document><document><id>1363</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Ataxia-telangiectasia: founder effect among north African Jews. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>64</offset><text>The ATM gene is responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) , characterized by cerebellar degeneration , immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition .

It is expressed in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and is activated during processes associated with neuroprotection. The retinal degeneration 10 (rd10) mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) was used to investigate the possible role of Sirt1 in this type of retinal degeneration. METHODS: Eyes from control and rd10 mice were used. Sirt1 mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization, and its abundance was estimated by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The presence of Sirt1 protein was investigated by immunohistofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The apoptosis of photoreceptor cells was analyzed by terminal dUTP transferase nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Immunolabeling for Sirt1, apoptosis-inducing factor (Aif), and caspase-12 (Casp-12) was performed on retinal tissue sections. RESULTS: Sirt1 mRNA and immunoreactivity were observed in normal adult mouse eyes. In the control retina, Sirt1 was immunolocalized mostly to the nucleus. In rd10 mice with retinal degeneration, changes in Sirt1 immunolabeling were observed only in the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL). The pathologic pattern of Sirt1 immunoreactivity correlated with the start of retinal degeneration in rd10 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a link between Sirt1 production and retinal degeneration in rd10 mice. The anti-apoptotic, neuroprotective role of Sirt1 in the mouse retina is based on the involvement of Sirt1 in double DNA strand-break repair mechanisms and in maintaining energy homeostasis in photoreceptor cells. The results suggest that the neuroprotective properties of Sirt1 may gradually weaken in rd10 mouse photoreceptor cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>1365</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical and genetic analysis for four Chinese families with Prader-Willi syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, genetic, multisystem disorder. Its major clinical features include neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive, mental retardation, hypogonadism, short hands and feet, hyperphagia-caused obesity, and characteristic appearance. The genetic basis of PWS is also complex. It is caused by the absence of expression of the active paternal genes such as the SNRPN, NDN, and possibly others in the PWS critical region on 15q11-13. PWS is in effect a contiguous gene syndrome resulting from deletion of the paternal copies of the imprinted. Consensus in clinical diagnostic criteria was established in 1993. However, identifying relevant patients for tests remains a challenge for most practitioners, as many features of the disorder are nonspecific, and others can be subtle or evolved over time. Consequently, molecular genetic tests can be used to diagnose PWS accurately, allowing early diagnosis of the syndrome. High resolution G-banding, high resolution cytogenetic methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are routinely used to diagnose PWS. In this study, four Chinese patients, with typical PWS features, were detected by MS-PCR and FISH. Three were cytogenetically normal, but lacked paternal expression of proximal chromosome 15q because of maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). The other one, however, demonstrated an unbalanced de novo translocation 46, XX, t (7; 15).</text></passage></document><document><id>1366</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The temporal stability of the Symptom Index among women at high-risk for ovarian cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the temporal stability of self-reported symptoms known to be associated with ovarian cancer. METHODS: This report is a longitudinal analysis of symptom reporting from 123 women who participated in the Seattle-based Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Study (OCEDS). The OCEDS population includes women at increased risk of ovarian cancer based on a family history of cancer or a BRCA I/II mutation. Data on symptoms were collected at two time points using a Symptoms Index that included abdominal pain, pelvic pain, feeling full quickly, inability to eat normally, abdominal bloating, and increased abdominal size. RESULTS: There was a median of 101 days between the two time points, with a range of 72-332 days. The median age of the women was 51, with a range of 32-79 years. Abdominal bloating was the most commonly reported symptom at both time points. The symptom least commonly reported at the two time points was inability to eat normally. The Symptoms Index was negative at both time points for 86% of all women and positive at both time points for 2% of all women. There were no statistically significant patterns of change for symptom reporting between time points. CONCLUSIONS: The Symptoms Index and women's report of abdominal pain, pelvic pain, feeling full quickly, unable to eat normally, abdominal bloating, increased abdominal size were stable between two time points in this sample. These findings provide evidence that longitudinal measurements of symptoms reporting by women in a screening study are likely to be reliable.</text></passage></document><document><id>1367</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The functional effect of pathogenic mutations in Rab escort protein 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>71</offset><text>Choroideremia (CHM) is a chorioretinal degeneration with an X-linked pattern of inheritance. Affected males experience progressive atrophy of the choroid, retinal pigment epithelium and retina leading to eventual blindness. The CHM gene encodes Rab escort protein 1 (REP-1). REP-1 is involved in trafficking of Rab proteins in the cell. To date, the majority of reported mutations in the CHM gene cause a complete loss of REP-1 function. Here we report pathogenic mutations: a novel missense mutation, L550P; a truncation c.1542T>A, STOP; and two deletions (c.525_526delAG and c.1646delC) in the CHM gene and their phenotypic effect. To analyze the effect of mutations, the 3D structure of human REP-1 and the proteins associated with REP-1 function were modeled using sequence homology with rat proteins. In silico analysis of the missense mutation L550P suggests that the proline residue at position 550 destabilizes the beta-structural elements, and the REP-1 tertiary structure. Truncation and deletion mutants are associated with a partial or total loss of the REP-1 essential activity and protein-protein interactions as predicted by the analysis of the structure and stability of these protein products. The presumptive loss of protein was confirmed by Western Blot analysis of protein from mononuclear cells and fibroblasts (FB) from CHM patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1368</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Non-ketotic hyperglycinemia: an aim of the second generation of studies on pathogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>Non-ketotic hyperglycinemia is caused by a molecular lesion involved in the glycine cleavage system and shows striking features representing the impaired central nervous system. For the study on molecular genetics of non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, we have isolated several cDNA clones, each encoding human glycine decarboxylase of H-protein, two of the four component enzymes of the glycine cleavage system. Although one of eight patients with this disease resulting from a lesion of glycine decarboxylase had the glycine decarboxylase gene deleted at a 5' region, they showed no common aberration detectable by glycine decarboxylase cDNA. Using the H-protein cDNA, we have demonstrated the rearranged structures, identified by one of the undetectable 5.0 and 5.5 kb SacI fragments, in the genomes of patients in whom there was an impaired expression of H-protein or glycine decarboxylase. The aberration of the 5.5 kb SacI fragment was associated with a defect of the 5.2 kb EcoRI fragment. Multiple genomic lesions are suggested for non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, and their implications in pathogenesis are discussed.</text></passage></document><document><id>1369</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>APC mutation spectrum of Norwegian familial adenomatous polyposis families: high ratio of novel mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>INTRODUCTION: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Massive formation of colorectal adenomas, of which some will inevitably develop into adenocarcinomas, is the hallmark of the disease. Characterization of causative APC mutations allows presymptomatic diagnosis, close follow-up and prophylactic intervention in families. To date more than 900 different germline mutations have been characterized worldwide demonstrating allelic heterogeneity. PURPOSE: The germline mutation spectrum of APC identified in 69 apparently unrelated Norwegian FAP families are presented and discussed with reference to clinical phenotype and novel mutation rate. METHODS: Different methods have been used over the years. However, all mutations were confirmed detectable by an implemented denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography screening approach. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis was employed for potential gross rearrangements. RESULTS: Fifty-three distinctive mutations were detected, of which 22 have been detected in Norway exclusively. Except for two major deletion mutations encompassing the entire APC, all mutations resulted in premature truncation of translation caused by non-sense (31%) or change in reading frame (69%). CONCLUSION: A high ratio of novel APC mutations continues to contribute to APC mutation heterogeneity causing FAP. This is the first comprehensive report of APC germline mutation spectrum in Norway.</text></passage></document><document><id>1370</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular characterization of non-subtype C and recombinant HIV-1 viruses from Cape Town, South Africa.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>HIV was first diagnosed within South Africa in 1982. Homosexual transmission of HIV-1 dominated the epidemic within the country in the early stages of the 1980s. Currently heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 is responsible for the majority of HIV cases in South Africa with subtype C HIV-1 being responsible for an estimated 95% of infections. Only a few papers have been published on non-subtype C HIV-1 detection within South Africa. This study characterized subgenomic and near full-length sequences of non-subtype C HIV-1 viruses from the Cape Town area. Amplification and direct sequencing characterized partial gene fragments of 11 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequenced data, with online subtyping tools (REGA and jpHMM) and the drawing of NJ-trees revealed the presence of subtypes A1, B, and F1 as well as recombinant viral forms such as AD, AG and AC. Near full-length genome characterization of 4 of the 11 samples was performed. Analysis of sequenced data with the use of subtyping, recombination identification, and tree drawing tools revealed one subtype B and one A1 isolate. The other two isolates were identified as AC and AD recombinants. The data that was gathered will greatly improve our knowledge of non-subtype C isolates circulating within South Africa.</text></passage></document><document><id>1371</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The protein factors MBNL1 and U2AF65 bind alternative RNA structures to regulate splicing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a genetic disorder linked to a (CTG)(n) repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Upon transcription in the nucleus, the CUG repeats form a stable RNA stem-loop that sequesters the RNA-binding protein MBNL1 from its normal function in the cell. MBNL1 regulates the alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs, and upon MBNL1's sequestration, the alternative splicing of many genes is mis-regulated, leading to disease symptoms. MBNL1 is known to bind directly to at least 3 of the pre-mRNAs that it regulates, but how MBNL1 binding mechanistically regulates alternative splicing is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that MBNL1 controls the splicing of exon 5 in the cardiac troponin T (cTNT) pre-mRNA by competing directly with the essential splicing factor U2AF65 for binding at the 3' end of intron 4. When U2AF65 is prevented from binding to the pre-mRNA, the U2 snRNP can no longer be recruited and the following exon is skipped. Furthermore, MBNL1 and U2AF65 appear to compete by binding to mutually exclusive RNA structures. When bound by splicing factors, the 3' end of intron 4 can form either a stem-loop or a single-stranded structure. MBNL1 binds a portion of the intron as a stem-loop, whereas U2AF65 binds the same region in a single-strand structure. Mutations that strengthen the stem-loop decrease U2AF65 binding affinity and also repress exon 5 inclusion, independently of MBNL1. Thus, U2AF65 binding can be blocked either by MBNL1 binding or by the stabilization of RNA secondary structure.</text></passage></document><document><id>1372</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Gene expression and mRNA editing of serotonin receptor 2C in brains of HPRT gene knock-out mice, an animal model of Lesch-Nyhan disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>137</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND), a genetic disorder associated with motor and psychiatric disturbance and self-injurious behaviour (SIB) is caused by a complete deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT).

Evidence exists for a role of basal ganglia dysfunction with decreased dopamine and excess serotonin striatal content. In this study, we investigate the role of serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) in the brains of HPRT gene knock-out mice, a model of LND. HTR2C expression is analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using SYBR-green detection methods. The percentage of edited HTR2C mRNA was determined by direct sequencing of amplification products of the region containing the editing sites. We found a 55% increase in the expression of HTR2C gene but no significant difference in mRNA editing levels between knock-out and control mice. The above alteration found in HPRT-deficient mice is similar to those found in other animal models used to study aggressive and self-injurious behaviour.</text></passage></document><document><id>1373</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Myotonia congenita.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>20</offset><text>There are two types of MC, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive (also called recessive generalized myotonia), both with the predominant clinical feature of diffuse myotonia.

Electrophysiologically and pathophysiologically, there is no difference between these two types. The major pathophysiologic abnormality is decreased membrane chloride conductance. Treatment of myotonia is not always necessary, but when it is, the most effective medications are those that stabilize the muscle membrane. Phenytoin is frequently the first choice because it has more benign side effect profile than other drugs and a reasonable response rate.</text></passage></document><document><id>1374</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The tyrosine phosphatase PTPRD is a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated and mutated in glioblastoma and other human cancers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>137</offset><text>Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating cellular function and is a central feature in signaling cascades involved in oncogenesis. The regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinately controlled by kinases and phosphatases (PTPs). Whereas activation of tyrosine kinases has been shown to play vital roles in tumor development, the role of PTPs is much less well defined. Here, we show that the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPRD) is frequently inactivated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a deadly primary neoplasm of the brain. PTPRD is a target of deletion in GBM, often via focal intragenic loss. In GBM tumors that do not possess deletions in PTPRD, the gene is frequently subject to cancer-specific epigenetic silencing via promoter CpG island hypermethylation (37%). Sequencing of the PTPRD gene in GBM and other primary human tumors revealed that the gene is mutated in 6% of GBMs, 13% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and in 9% of lung cancers. These mutations were deleterious. In total, PTPRD inactivation occurs in >50% of GBM tumors, and loss of expression predicts for poor prognosis in glioma patients. Wild-type PTPRD inhibits the growth of GBM and other tumor cells, an effect not observed with PTPRD alleles harboring cancer-specific mutations. Human astrocytes lacking PTPRD exhibited increased growth. PTPRD was found to dephosphorylate the oncoprotein STAT3. These results implicate PTPRD as a tumor suppressor on chromosome 9p that is involved in the development of GBMs and multiple human cancers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1375</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Papillon-Lef  vre syndrome and malignant melanoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>51</offset></passage></document><document><id>1376</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Factor VIII-von Willebrand factor binding defects in autosomal recessive von Willebrand disease type Normandy and in mild hemophilia A.

Hereditary melanoma is defined as two or more first-degree relatives having melanoma. A member of a melanoma-prone family has a 35-70-fold increased relative risk of developing a melanoma. Genetic susceptibility is linked to the major susceptibility genes CDKN2A and CDK4, and the minor susceptibility gene MC1R. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous melanoma in melanoma-prone families from Uruguay. METHODS: We studied 13 individuals from six melanoma-prone families living in Uruguay. Phenotype, familial and personal history were recorded. Molecular screening of CDKN2A and CDK4 was done by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. The MC1R gene was sequenced. RESULTS: Mutations in CDKN2A were detected in five of six families: c.-34G>T, p.G101W and p.E88X. A novel germline mutation p.E88X, associated with hereditary melanoma in two unrelated families, is described. We hypothesize that a founder effect occurred probably in the Mediterranean region. No mutations in CDK4 were detected. Six different MC1R variants, all previously reported, were present in Uruguayan families. CONCLUSIONS: The overall rate of deleterious CDKN2A mutations in our familial melanoma pedigrees, even though the sample size is small, was considerably higher (83%) than the often quoted range.</text></passage></document><document><id>1378</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic epidemiology of breast cancer in Britain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>50</offset><text>A complex segregation analysis was conducted on two British series (one consecutive series of probands with breast cancer and one series ascertained through a normal consultand).

ATP7B is expressed in hepatic, brain and kidney cells, and a defect can lead to liver, neurological and renal damage in WND patients. Presentation is variable with a broad range of age of onset and symptoms, and not all biochemical signs used in diagnosis are found in every patient. Therefore, diagnosis by mutation analysis is particularly important. To date, there are approximately 380 probable disease-causing variants in ATP7B, 33 of which are splice site variants that are predicted to affect splicing, based on their location. Few of these splice site variants have been analyzed in vivo. Some exonic variations also have the potential to affect splicing. The aim of this project was to use minigenes for transcript analysis. We have chosen exon 8 as our focus and have cloned a wild-type three-exon minigene into a mammalian expression vector. After transfection, extracted RNA was analyzed by reverse transcription PCR and accurate splicing was detected. This minigene will facilitate the analysis of the numerous potential splice variants identified in exon 8 of ATP7B, with the advantage that patient cell lines are not required for each variant.</text></passage></document><document><id>1381</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Further evidence of genetic heterogeneity segregating with hereditary gingival fibromatosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset><text>AIM: To clinically characterize and map the disease-associated locus in a five-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant early-onset hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A complete oral examination was conducted. Genomic DNA samples were obtained from 14 individuals. Short tandem repeats markers, which encompass four previously known loci related to HGF, were genotyped. Two-point log of the odds (LOD) scores were calculated using MLINK program of the LINKAGE software, multipoint and non-parametric linkage (NPL) analysis were performed using the GENEHUNTER software. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation and histological examination of this family suggested typical features of HGF. The onset age was early in the generations, ranging between 1 and 2 years. None of the tested markers showed cosegregation among affected individuals. Genotyping data from four putative regions yielded significant negative two-point LOD scores (&lt;-2.0) at theta=0. The maximum multipoint LOD scores and NPL analysis revealed exclusion of these loci as well. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusion of linkage in this family to any of the known HGF loci proved the existence of a novel locus for autosomal dominant HGF and showed that this rare disorder is far more heterogeneous than previously expected.</text></passage></document><document><id>1382</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The COP9 signalosome mediates beta-catenin degradation by deneddylation and blocks adenomatous polyposis coli destruction via USP15.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>133</offset><text>The Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway has important roles in normal cellular proliferation, development and angiogenesis. Many malignant transformations, including sporadic colorectal tumours, are caused by constitutive activation of the Wnt route due to mutations in the tumour suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or the beta-catenin oncogene, ultimately resulting in reduced beta-catenin degradation by the ubiquitin (Ub) proteasome system (UPS). The COP9 signalosome (CSN) regulates the UPS by controlling cullin-RING Ub ligases (CRLs). We show here that the CSN and the beta-catenin destruction complex cooperate in targeting beta-catenin for degradation by the UPS. Together with the CRL that ubiquitinates beta-catenin, they form a supercomplex responsible for beta-catenin degradation. Wnt3A, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitors or mutation of CSN-mediated deneddylation induce the disassembly of the supercomplex and the accumulation of beta-catenin. Likewise, downregulation of the CSN in HeLa cells leads to retarded degradation of beta-catenin. Additionally, we found that the knockdown of the CSN causes accelerated proteolysis of APC, an essential component of the beta-catenin destruction complex, which is degraded by the UPS as beta-catenin. We show here that APC is stabilised by the Ub-specific protease 15 (USP15) associated with the CSN. This is demonstrated by over-expression of siRNA oligonucleotides against USP15 or by over-expression of an USP15 mutant, which is unable to degrade poly-Ub chains. Thus, the CSN controls the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by assisting the assembly of beta-catenin-degrading supercomplexes by deneddylation and, simultaneously, by stabilising APC via CSN-associated USP15. The CSN regulates the balance between beta-catenin and APC. Disturbance of this balance can cause cancer by driving cell transformation, tumour angiogenesis and metastasis. A model is provided that proposes a role of CSN-mediated deneddylation in the formation of the beta-catenin-degrading supercomplex and the protection of complex-bound APC via CSN-associated USP15.</text></passage></document><document><id>1383</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cytogenetics of renal cell carcinomas associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>To establish the chromosome pattern, we have analyzed short-term cultures of 24 renal cell carcinomas (RCC) from four patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL).

These results indicate that non-papillary sporadic and VHL-RCCs have common genetic mechanisms that result in the loss of the 3p13-pter region containing one or more putative suppressor genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1384</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Traction on immobilized netrin-1 is sufficient to reorient axons.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>During embryonic development, axons are guided to their target by patterning proteins encountered along their trajectory.

Advancing spinal commissural neuron growth cones were shown to generate local forces of 4 to 15 piconewtons but, when confronted with immobilized netrin-1, generated traction forces in excess of 63 piconewtons on netrin-1 that can redirect the trajectory of the axon.</text></passage></document><document><id>1385</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B and PDGF-receptor b is associated with lymphatic metastasis in human gastric carcinoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>142</offset><text>Recent study of murine fibrosarcoma has revealed that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) plays a direct role in promoting lymphangiogenesis and metastatic spread to lymph nodes. Thus, we investigated the relation between PDGF and PDGF receptor (PDGF-R) expression and lymphatic metastasis in human gastric carcinoma. We examined PDGF-B and PDGF-Rb expression in four human gastric carcinoma cell lines (TMK-1, MKN-1, MKN-45, and KKLS) and in 38 surgical specimens of gastric carcinoma. PDGF-B and PDGF-Rb expression was examined by immunofluorescence in surgical specimens and in human gastric carcinoma cells (TMK-1) implanted orthotopically in nude mice. Groups of mice (n = 10, each) received saline (control) or PDGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. PDGF-B and PDGF-Rb mRNA expression was significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastasis than in those without and was also significantly higher in diffuse-type carcinoma than in intestinal-type carcinoma. In surgical specimens, tumor cells expressed PDGF-B, but PDGF-Rb was expressed predominantly by stromal cells. Under culture conditions, expression of PDGF-B mRNA was found in all of the gastric cell lines, albeit at different levels. In orthotopic TMK-1 tumors, cancer cells expressed PDGF-B but not PDGF-Rb. PDGF-Rb was expressed by stromal cells, including lymphatic endothelial cells. Four weeks of treatment with imatinib significantly decreased the area of lymphatic vessels. Our data indicate that secretion of PDGF-B by gastric carcinoma cells and expression of PDGF-Rb by tumor-associated stromal cells are associated with lymphatic metastasis. Blockade of PDGF-R signaling pathways may inhibit lymph node metastasis of gastric carcinoma.</text></passage></document><document><id>1386</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>General aspects and neuropathology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>X-adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a metabolic, peroxisomal disease affecting the nervous system, adrenal cortex and testis resulting from inactivating mutations in ABCD1 gene which encodes a peroxisomal membrane half-adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter, ABCD1 (or ALDP), whose defect is associated with impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation and accumulation of saturated very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in tissues and body fluids. Several phenotypes are recognized in male patients including cerebral ALD in childhood, adolescence or adulthood, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), Addison's disease and, eventually, gonadal insufficiency. Female carriers might present with mild to severe myeloneuropathy that resembles AMN. There is a lack of phenotype-genotype correlations, as the same ABCD1 gene mutation may be associated with different phenotypes in the same family, suggesting that genetic, epigenetic, environmental and stochastic factors are probably contributory to the development and course of the disease. Degenerative changes, like those seen in pure AMN without cerebral demyelination, are characterized by loss of axons and secondary myelin in the long tracts of the spinal cord, possibly related to the impaired lipid metabolism of VLCFAs and the associated alterations (ie, oxidative damage). Similar lesions are encountered following inactivation of ABCD1 in mice (ABCD1(-)). A different and more aggressive phenotype is secondary to cerebral demyelination, very often accompanied by inflammatory changes in the white matter of the brain and associated with activation of T lymphocytes, CD1 presentation and increased levels of cytokines, gamma-interferon, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-2 and IL-6, Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, chemokines and chemokine receptors.</text></passage></document><document><id>1387</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Expression of RNA CCUG repeats dysregulates translation and degradation of proteins in myotonic dystrophy 2 patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy 2 (DM2) is a multisystem skeletal muscle disease caused by an expansion of tetranucleotide CCTG repeats, the transcription of which results in the accumulation of untranslated CCUG RNA. In this study, we report that CCUG repeats both bind to and misregulate the biological functions of cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes. Two CCUG-interacting complexes were subsequently purified and analyzed. A major component of one of the complexes was found to be the 20S catalytic core complex of the proteasome. The second complex was found to contain CUG triplet repeat RNA-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) and the translation initiation factor eIF2. Consistent with the biological functions of the 20S proteasome and the CUGBP1-eIF2 complexes, the stability of short-lived proteins and the levels of the translational targets of CUGBP1 were shown to be elevated in DM2 myoblasts. We found that the overexpression of CCUG repeats in human myoblasts from unaffected patients, in C2C12 myoblasts, and in a DM2 mouse model alters protein translation and degradation, similar to the alterations observed in DM2 patients. Taken together, these findings show that RNA CCUG repeats misregulate protein turnover on both the levels of translation and proteasome-mediated protein degradation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1388</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Relative role of APC and MUTYH mutations in the pathogenesis of familial adenomatous polyposis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an interesting model for the study of colorectal tumour. Two genes contribute to the FAP phenotype - APC and MUTYH - but their relative role is still undefined. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of the two genes to the pathogenesis of FAP by means of a series of FAP families. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-one unrelated families with a diagnosis of FAP and a total of 187 affected individuals were evaluated. After extracting DNA, APC and MUTYH genes were sequenced. RESULTS: In the whole series of patients, colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was the most frequent surgery, although the number of patients treated by total proctocolectomy and ileoanal anastomosis was increasing. Duodenal and jejunal-ileal adenomas were present in more than half of the patients. Constitutional mutations were detected in 37 of the 45 families (82.2%); there were 33 families with APC and 4 with MUTYH alterations. Age at onset of polyposis and age at surgery were 10-15 years delayed for carriers of MUTYH mutations; cancer at diagnosis was frequent, and extracolonic manifestations were diagnosed in the majority of MUTYH-positive families. MUTYH-associated polyposis showed the horizontal transmission expected for recessive inheritance (at variance with the dominant pattern seen with APC mutations). CONCLUSIONS: At least two genes are associated with the FAP phenotype. APC mutations account for the majority of cases, while MUTYH mutations can be observed in 10% of patients. There are few but definite differences between APC- and MUTYH-associated FAP, such as age at diagnosis and pattern of transmission.</text></passage></document><document><id>1389</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a novel mutation in the SLC26A4 gene in an Italian with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>114</offset><text>Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goitre and defective iodide organification.

Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) was described in patients with recessive dRTA and SNHL, and recently, this abnormality has been associated with mutations in the ATP6V1B1 gene. In our study, we evaluated the presence of inner-ear abnormalities in four patients affected by dRTA and SNHL, characterized by molecular analysis. Two patients affected by severe dRTA with early onset SNHL showed the same mutation in the ATP6V1B1 gene and bilateral EVA with a different degree of severity. The other two presented similar clinical manifestations of dRTA and different mutations in the ATP6V0A4 gene: one patient, showing EVA, developed an early SNHL, whereas in the other one, the SNHL appeared in the second decade of life and the vestibular aqueduct was normal. Our study confirms the association of EVA and mutations in the ATP6V1B1 gene and demonstrates that mutations in the ATP6V0A4 gene can also be associated with EVA probably only when the SNHL has an early onset.

METHODS: Mutational screening was carried out by sequencing. Genotyping was carried out for determining quadruplet zygosity. RESULTS: The proband was a carrier of a novel RB1 constitutive mutation (g.2056C>G) which was not detected in her father or her unaffected sisters, and of two other mutations (g.39606 C>T and g.174351T>A) also present in two monozygotic sisters. The novel mutation probably occurred de novo while the others were of likely maternal origin. The novel mutation, affecting the Kozak consensus at the 5'UTR of RB1 and g.174351T>A were likely associated to retinoblastoma in the proband. CONCLUSION: Molecular diagnosis of retinoblastoma requires genotypic data of the family for determining hereditary transmission. In the case of children generated by IVF with oocytes from an anonymous donor which had been stored in a cell repository, this might not be successfully accomplished, making precise diagnosis impracticable for genetic counseling.</text></passage></document><document><id>1394</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>HFE gene mutations in patients with altered iron metabolism in Argentina.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload syndrome caused by increased duodenal iron absorption, which leads to excessive iron deposition in parenchymal cells of the liver and mayor organs, causing cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiac failure, endocrine complications and arthritis.

We investigate the prevalence of C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in 95 individuals (77 males, 18 females) bearing iron metabolism alterations to establish an early diagnosis of HH. Among this population, 58% carried mutations in the HFE gene (45 males, 10 females). H63D mutation was found in 32.6% of the subjects (29.5% in heterozygocity, 3.15% in homozygocity). S65C mutation was only detected in the heterozygous form (5.3% of the patients), 2 of them carried also H63D mutation. C282Y in heterozygocity was found in 15.8% of the individuals; but only 4.15% carried this mutation in homozygocity.

The cDNA encodes for a protein of 50 kDa , as predicted . The cDNA of mouse HGO has an overall identity of 41 % to the corresponding gene hmgA from Aspergillus . Sequence similarities to human expressed sequence tags ( EST ) clones ranged from 70 % to 20 % . The positions of 122 conserved amino acids could be determined by multiple sequence alignment . We identified one first intron of 928 b in the mouse gene . The gene for HGO seems to be expressed in various tissues , as shown by RT-PCR on different cDNAs . FISH experiments with the whole murine cDNA as probe clearly revealed signals at the human chromosomal band 3q13 . 3-q21 .

The majority of human PLP1 mutations are caused by duplications; almost all others are caused by missense mutations. The cellular events leading to the phenotype are unknown. The same mutations in non-humans make them ideal models to study the mechanisms that cause neurological sequelae. In the present study we show that mice with Plp1 duplications (Plp1tg) have major mitochondrial deficits with a 50% reduction in ATP, a drastically reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased numbers of mitochondria. In contrast, the jp (jimpy) mouse with a Plp1 missense mutation exhibits normal mitochondrial function. We show that PLP in the Plp1tg mice and in Plp1-transfected cells is targeted to mitochondria. PLP has motifs permissive for insertion into mitochondria and deletions near its N-terminus prevent its co-localization to mitochondria. These novel data show that Plp1 missense mutations and duplications of the native Plp1 gene initiate uniquely different cellular responses.</text></passage></document><document><id>1400</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Paternal transmission of congenital myotonic dystrophy. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>56</offset><text>We report a rare case of paternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) .

The homoallelic 444leucine to proline mutation was found only in patients with type I disease. Of the 8 type I patients, 5 had the homoallelic mutation and 2 had one mutant allele. One patient with type II disease did not have this mutant allele. Of the 2 type III patients, one had a single mutant allele whereas the other exhibited no mutation of this kind. These results suggest that the 444leucine to proline mutation is very common in the type I (non-neuronopathic form) disease and is not tightly associated only with neuronopathic types of Gaucher disease in Japanese patients. These findings seem to conflict with others showing that this mutation is partially responsible for the occurrence of neuronopathic Gaucher disease.

The defect is caused by mutations in the genes encoding ITGA2B or ITGB3. This results in qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of the platelet receptor, alpha IIb-beta 3. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the mutations in GT patients and to correlate these with patient phenotype. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 45 unrelated patients with GT were enrolled in the present study to identify the causative molecular defects, and also to correlate their phenotype with their genotype. Platelet aggregation, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and mutation screening by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) followed by sequencing were performed in all patients. Novel mutations were analyzed for penetrance in individual families. RESULTS: A total of 22 novel mutations were identified in 45 unrelated GT patients. Mutations were identified in 36 of the 45 (80%) patients. Missense mutations were seen in most of the GT patients (59%). The remaining mutations were heterogeneous and were distributed throughout the length of the gene. Analysis of family members showed heterozygous mutations in all families. CONCLUSIONS: The severe type I GT was the most common subtype found in this study. Missense mutations were identified as the defects responsible for most GT patients. Carrier detection and genetic counseling in these families is a potentially effective alternative for decreasing the burden of severe type of GT.</text></passage></document><document><id>1406</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A previously undescribed mutation within the tetramerisation domain of TP53 in a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>We report details of a family with classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome in which there is a mutation in codon 344 of the tumour suppressor gene TP53 .

Premorbid physical, intellectual, and passive activity levels were used to generate scores in the categories of leisure, nonleisure (education, occupation and domestic duties) and total lifestyle. AO was associated with increased CAG repeat length as expected (r = -0.72, P &lt; 0.001), but also with a lifestyle that included higher levels of passive activity (r = -0.38, P &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression modeling showed lifestyle passivity to be a variable independent of CAG repeat length in predicting AO (R(2) = 0.54, b = -0.22, P = 0.005). Comparison of the mean AO across tertiles of lifestyle passivity scores showed onset 4.6 years (95% CI = 1.3-7.9) later in the least compared with the most passive tertile. CAG repeat length was also shown to predict lifestyle passivity (R(2) = 0.12, b = 1.08, P &lt; 0.0005). Neither intellectual nor physical activity showed significant relationships to AO or CAG repeat length in this cohort. Our study leads to two conclusions: that a passive lifestyle may be a preclinical expression of HD, and that it actually contributes to the earlier onset of symptoms. Overcoming the tendency to be passive may substantially delay onset of HD.

A 45-year-old man, a diagnosed case of mediastinal DLBL with bilateral lung involvement, was treated with conventional 6 cycles of chemotherapy and local external radiotherapy with initial good treatment response evidenced by considerable regression in mass size and regression in pulmonary lesions. Three months later, he returned with complaints of soft tissue swelling over the scalp; one of them in the high parietal bone and the other over the occipital region. A whole body FDG-PET at this time showed 2 moderate-sized foci in the scalp (with preservation of both tables of skull bone) and corresponding large foci in the brain parenchyma beneath, a superior mediastinal focus, a few foci in the apical and lower zone of left lung, extensive irregular uptake in the right pleura and the right lung parenchyma coupled with a loculated effusion in its lower zone and studded foci of hypermetabolism throughout the bilaterally enlarged kidneys. CT of the head confirmed the FDG-PET findings and histopathology of the biopsy from the scalp swelling was suggestive of DLBL. Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen showed lobulated bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple hypoechoic areas within them. The patient underwent palliative local external radiotherapy to the brain and systemic chemotherapy with poor clinical results with raised serum beta-2 microglobulin and serum LDH levels and deranged renal function. The patient died within a month after the FDG-PET study. The event of scalp and bilateral renal involvement from DLBL is rare in lymphoma literature and this report highlights that such unusual events can occur as part of widespread dissemination and underscores the importance of whole-body imaging with FDG-PET.</text></passage></document><document><id>1409</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Wound complications after cleft repair in children with Van der Woude syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Van der Woude syndrome (VWS; OMIM 119300) is an autosomal-dominant condition associated with clefts of the lip and/or palate and lower lip pits and is caused by mutations in interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6). The standard of practice for children born with cleft lip/palate is surgical repair, which requires proper wound healing. We tested the hypothesis that children with VWS are more likely to have wound complications after cleft repair than children with nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (NSCLP). Furthermore, we hypothesized that children with VWS have more surgical procedures. A retrospective, case-controlled study was performed. Seventeen children with VWS and 68 matched controls with NSCLP were scored for the presence of wound complications after cleft repair, for the severity of complications, and for number of surgeries from age 0 to 10. Of the 17 children with VWS, 8 had wound complications. Of 68 controls, 13 had wound complications (P = 0.02). Of 8 wound complications in the VWS group, 6 were major, whereas of 13 complications in the control group, 9 were major (P = 0.04). Most wound complications were fistulae and occurred in isolated cleft palate and bilateral cleft lip. The mean number of surgeries in the VWS group was 3.0 compared with 2.8 in the control group (P = 0.67). Our studies suggest that children with VWS have an increased risk for wound complications after cleft repair compared with children with NSCLP. Furthermore, these data support a role for IRF6 in wound healing.</text></passage></document><document><id>1410</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Genetic analysis of an inherited afibrinogenemia family caused by a novel frameshift mutation in FGA].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>Inherited afibrinogenemia is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disease characterized by complete absence of fibrinogen in blood. To identify the genotype in a Chinese family with inherited afibrinogenemia, the samples of peripheral blood were collected from 6 members of 3 generations. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT) and fibrinogen (Fg, clauss) were tested. Fg was also analyzed by using immunoturbidimetry method. DNAs of six members were extracted by using a DNA extract kit. All the exons and exon-intron boundaries of the three fibrinogen genes were amplified by using PCR and analyzed by direct sequencing. The results showed that the parents of proband were 3 degree consanguinity. A homozygous c.934_935insA in FGA was found in proband which results in the change of protein p.Ser312fsX42. The parents, grandmother, maternal grandmother and father's sister were all detected with heterozygous mutation which was same as that in proband. In conclusion homozygous c.934_935insA in FGA is a cause of inherited afibrinogenemia and a novel mutation being reported.</text></passage></document><document><id>1411</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Antiplatelet antibodies in WASP(-) mice correlate with evidence of increased in vivo platelet consumption.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To study the role of antiplatelet antibodies in the thrombocytopenia of murine Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A flow cytometric method was developed for detection of serum antiplatelet antibodies via their binding to intact target platelets lacking surface antibodies. Platelets were labeled with 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) in order to track their clearance from the circulation. WASP(-)muMT(-/-) mice were generated by standard breeding methods. RESULTS: Serum antiplatelet antibodies were detected in approximately 40% of WASP(-) males. The mean level of reticulated platelets is significantly increased in these antibody(+) males. While WASP(-) males show an approximately 50% reduction in platelet counts, 5% to 10% show a more severe thrombocytopenia associated with increased reticulated platelets, suggesting the presence of clearance-inducing antiplatelet antibodies. In support of that inference, 90% of the latter mice show detectable serum antiplatelet antibodies. The antibodies are primarily immunoglobulin G, and are also detected in >30% of CD47(-/-) males. WASP(-)muMT(-/-) males, which demonstrate no serum- or platelet-associated antibodies, show a degree of thrombocytopenia similar to that of WASP(-) males. Their platelet clearance rates remain accelerated--more so in WASP(-)muMT(-/-) than WASP(+)muMT(-/-) recipients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that platelet WASP deficiency results in an increase in platelet clearance rates by two mechanisms: an antibody-independent mechanism that largely requires WASP deficiency in trans, and an antibody-dependent mechanism that does not. Both an increased incidence of antiplatelet antibodies and an increased susceptibility to their effects contribute to antibody-dependent clearance of WASP(-) platelets.</text></passage></document><document><id>1412</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sperm meiotic segregation and aneuploidy in a 46,X,inv(Y),t(10;15) carrier: case report.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>89</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the meiotic segregation and an interchromosomal effect in sperm of an inv(Y) (p11.1;q11.2),t(10;15) (q25.2;q12) carrier. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Research institute. PATIENT(S): Man with a karyotype 46,X,inv(Y),t(10;15), normal sperm parameters, and secondary infertility. INTERVENTION(S): Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes for chromosomes 10, 15, 8, 18, 21, X, and Y. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Frequencies of meiotic segregation products and aneuploidy of chromosomes 8, 18, 21, X, and Y. RESULT(S): The most frequent type of meiotic segregation was the alternate (40.82%), followed by the adjacent 1 (28.09%), adjacent 2 (16.33%), and 3:1 (9.91%) segregations. Neither deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio of the X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa nor any evidence of an interchromosomal effect on aneuploidy of chromosomes X, Y, 8, 18, and 21 and diploidy was observed in the carrier compared with control donors. The disomies of chromosomes 8 and 21 were equally frequent in X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa of the carrier. CONCLUSION(S): The fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of meiotic segregation and aneuploidy helps to personalize the reproductive risk in carriers of balanced structural chromosomal aberrations. Complete information concerning the quality of spermatogenesis is necessary in all donors (both translocation carriers and controls) implicated in interchromosomal effect studies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1413</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fine mapping of the chromosome 11q22-23 region using PFGE, linkage and haplotype analysis; localization of the gene for ataxia telangiectasia to a 5cM region flanked by NCAM/DRD2 and STMY/CJ52.75, phi 2.22.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>207</offset><text>Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and a range of different enzyme digests, we have established that both markers of each of the pairs CJ52.208/YNB3.12, NCAM/DRD2, and STMY/CJ52.75, on chromosome 11q22-23, show physical linkage on a single DNA fragment. We have also shown, using genetic linkage and haplotype analyses, that these markers lie within a region of approximately 18cM, which, it has been shown previously, is likely to contain the A-T gene. The relative positions of these marker loci, and the distance between them was determined in order to construct a detailed map which has allowed a more precise localization of the A-T gene. We have shown that in pairwise linkage analysis the strongest support for linkage to the A-T gene was with the STMY/CJ52.75 locus (Z = 5.59, theta = 0.0). A three-point analysis using the results from STMY/CJ52.75 and the closely linked marker phi 2.22 gave Z = 5.55, theta = 0.03. Despite persisting evidence of some linkage to Thy-1 our results are consistent with the existence of a single A-T locus on chromosome 11q22-23 and our best estimate of the position of this locus places it between NCAM/DRD2 and (STMY/CJ52.75, F2.22) (Z = 6.74), a region of approximately 5cM in males.</text></passage></document><document><id>1414</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic parameters for guiding ability in purpose bred dogs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset></passage></document><document><id>1415</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Two mutations within the coding sequence of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Two previously unidentified mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus were found during a study of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia. One mutation eliminates the BamHI site in exon 7 and the other eliminates the HindIII site in exon 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. They were suspected because of deviating restriction fragment patterns and confirmed by amplification, via the polymerase chain reaction, of exon 7 and exon 11, respectively, followed by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme. Direct sequencing of amplified mutant exon 7 revealed a G/C to T/A transversion at the first base of codon 272, substituting a GGA glycine codon for a UGA stop codon. Direct sequencing of amplified mutant exon 11 revealed a deletion of codon 364, a CTT leucine codon. The exon 7 mutation can be expected to result in a truncated protein and the exon 11 mutation in the elimination of an amino acid in the catalytic region of the enzyme. A patient who is a compound heterozygote for these two mutations has classical phenylketonuria. It is concluded that each of the two mutations leads to a profound loss of enzymatic activity. The segregation of these mutations with disease alleles in 4 and 2 families, respectively, supports the hypothesis that multiple mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus explain the variable phenylalanine tolerance in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.</text></passage></document><document><id>1416</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Retinal degeneration in the rd mouse is caused by a defect in the beta subunit of rod cGMP-phosphodiesterase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset><text>Mice homozygous for the rd mutation display hereditary retinal degeneration and the classic rd lines serve as a model for human retinitis pigmentosa.

Degeneration is preceded by accumulation of cyclic GMP in the retina and is correlated with deficient activity of the rod photoreceptor cGMP-phosphodiesterase. We have recently isolated a candidate complementary DNA for the rd gene from a mouse retinal library and completed the characterization of cDNAs encoding all subunits of bovine photoreceptor phosphodiesterase. The candidate cDNA shows strong homology with a cDNA encoding the bovine phosphodiesterase beta subunit.

The allele frequencies of the three intragenic polymorphisms studied (TaqI, XmnI and DdeI) did not differ significantly from those reported in other Caucasian populations. A considerable degree of linkage disequilibrium between the three polymorphisms was observed. Carriership evaluated in 39 females at risk led to exclusion in 14 while carriership was established in 5. The proportion of women who by pedigree analysis had a carriership risk between 10% and 90% could be reduced from 97% to 51% by RFLP analysis. Prenatal diagnosis using an intragenic polymorphism could potentially be offered to 69% of hemophilia carriers. DNAs from 19 unrelated patients were screened for mutations using a full-length cDNA probe, but no abnormal hybridization patterns were observed.

The G6PD enzyme catalyzes the first step in the pentose phosphate pathway to protect cells against oxidative stress. Mutations in the G6PD gene will cause functional variants with various biochemical and clinical phenotypes. So far, about 160 mutations along with more than 400 biochemical variants have been described. G6PD-MutDB is a disease-specific resource of G6PD deficiency, collecting and integrating G6PD mutations with biochemical and clinical phenotypes. Data of G6PD deficiency is manually extracted from published papers, focusing primarily on variants with identified mutation and well-described quantitative phenotypes. G6PD-MutDB implements an approach, CNSHA predictor, to help identify a potential chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) phenotype of an unknown mutation. G6PD-MutDB is believed to facilitate analysis of relationship between molecular mutation and functional phenotype of G6PD deficiency owing to convenient data resource and useful tools.

These data were compared with the genotypes of each plant at 11 marker loci which are distributed among the seven chromosomes of Petunia and which determine flower, pollen, and isozyme phenotypes. From these analyses, members of these six actin gene subfamilies were mapped to five locations on five Petunia chromosomes: the PAc9, PAc1, PAc4, and PAc2 subfamilies are on chromosomes I, II, III, and VII respectively; the PAc3 and PAc7 subfamilies are tightly linked on chromosome IV.

Overall, APC or MUTYH mutations were detected in 42/48 (88%), 14/20 (70%) and 10/38 (26%) of FAP, AFAP and MCRA patients, respectively. APC and MUTYH mutations accounted for 81% and 7% of FAP patients and for 30% and 40% of AFAP patients, respectively. Notably, MCRA patients did not present APC mutations. In 26% of these patients, an MUTYH mutation was identified and the detection rate increased with the number of adenomas, irrespectively of family history, being significantly higher in MCRA patients presenting more than 30 adenomas [7/12 (58%) vs 2/14 (14%), p = 0.023]. We validate the recently proposed guidelines in our patient's cohort and show that APC or MUTYH germline defects are responsible for the majority of clinically well-characterized patients with FAP and AFAP phenotype, and patients with more than 30 colorectal adenomas. The different mutation frequencies according to family history and to the number of adenomas underscore the importance of an adequate familial characterization, both clinically and by colonoscopy, in the management of FAP-like phenotypes.

LGI4 belongs to a family of proteins with the epilepsy-associated repeat (EAR) domain and is associated with various epilepsies. We investigated whether LGI4 is a candidate gene for BFIC. METHODS: Fifteen patients with BFIC were examined for mutations and/or polymorphisms of LGI4 by using a direct sequencing method. RESULTS: Several frequent polymorphisms were identified. The genotype frequency distribution of c.1722G/A polymorphism was significantly different between patients with BFIC and control subjects (p&lt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the G allele of c.1722G/A polymorphism had significant recessive effects on the increased relative risk for BFIC (p&lt;0.05).

Although in vitro expression studies demonstrated that the R446W isoform was biologically similar to wildtype Tmprss6, clinical data indicate that the R446W produces a milder disease when carried in trans with severe mutation in Tmprss6. The four children carrying mutations in TMPRSS6 all exhibited inappropriately high urinary hepcidin levels for the degree of iron deficiency.</text></passage></document><document><id>1430</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular and structural analysis of metachromatic leukodystrophy patients in Indian population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>97</offset><text>Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene.

The present study was undertaken to identify mutations in arylsulfatase A gene in Indian MLD patients, to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlation, and to see the effect of the novel mutants on the protein. Twenty MLD patients (16 families) were screened by ARMS PCR for the most common mutation (c.459+1G>A). Pseudodeficiency alleles were tested by RFLP method whereas rare and novel mutations were scanned by Conformation Sensitive Gel Electrophoresis (CSGE), followed by sequencing. The genotype-phenotype correlation was also attempted. Protein homology modeling analysis was carried out for two novel missense mutations identified, to assess the effect of these mutations on the protein conformation. Nine pathogenic alleles were found in 13 patients (65%). Four previously reported mutations and five novel variants were identified. Five patients (35%) were found to have pseudodeficiency alleles, c.1049A>G (p.Asn350Ser) and c.1524+95A>G. Genotype-phenotype correlation was found to be difficult to establish. Protein modeling studies showed that the mutations cause loss of interactions leading to conformational change in ASA protein. The study identified the mutational spectrum of Indian MLD patients, which will be helpful in genetic counseling, carrier detection and establishing prenatal diagnosis. Homology modeling helped to study conformational change in protein and has implications in generating novel therapeutic molecules.</text></passage></document><document><id>1431</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Twenty years of dysuria in a patient with Addison's disease: a case report.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder affecting approximately 1 in 21,000 males, and is estimated to be the cause of adrenal insufficiency in approximately 35% of patients with idiopathic Addison's disease.

Specific populations generally carry a small number of mutations, the most common of which are those that are widely distributed regionally. The present study constitutes an extensive molecular characterization of this disease in a small, highly inbred ethnic group with a high incidence of beta-thalassemia--the Jews of Kurdistan. An unusual mutational diversity was observed. In 42 sibships 13 different mutations were identified, of which 3 are newly discovered: a C----A transversion at -88 to the cap site, a frameshift in codon 36/37, and an A----G transition in the polyadenylylation signal. Four of the mutations are unique to Kurdish Jews and have not been discovered in any other population. A fifth was found outside Kurdish Jews only in an Iranian from Khuzistan, a region bordering Kurdistan. Two-thirds of the mutant chromosomes carry the mutations unique to Kurdish Jews. We traced the origin of the mutations to specific geographic regions within Kurdistan. This information, supported by haplotype analysis, suggests that thalassemia in central Kurdistan (northern Iraq) has evolved primarily from multiple mutational events. In Turkish Kurdistan, the primary mechanism is genetic admixture with the local population. In Iranian Kurdistan, a founder effect appears to be partly responsible. We conclude that several evolutionary mechanisms contributed to the evolution of beta-thalassemia in this small ethnic isolate.</text></passage></document><document><id>1433</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Centromeric alpha-satellite DNA break in reciprocal translocations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>In the process of selecting fluorescence in situ hybridization probes to be used for preimplantation genetic diagnosis in couples with balanced reciprocal translocations, we found 2 individuals with unexpected breaks in the centromeric alpha-satellite DNA. Subsequently, centromere breaks were specifically sought in reciprocal translocations in which 1 or both breakpoints appeared cytogenetically near the centromere. In a total of 11 individuals studied, we found 8 centromere breaks in 6 individuals; in 2 individuals, the alpha-satellite DNA of both chromosomes involved in the translocation split into 2 arrays. These findings suggest that breaks in alpha-satellite DNA are not rare events. Together with those previously reported in the literature, alpha-satellite DNA breaks of at least chromosomes X, 1, 4, 5, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, and 19 have now been documented. The breaks are familial in 2 of the 6 cases in our study, indicating the derivative chromosomes are both mitotically and meiotically stable. These derivative chromosomes that are either cytogenetically dicentric or molecular cytogenetically dicentric, or have altered amounts of alpha-satellite DNA may prove to be valuable in studying centromere dynamics and biology.</text></passage></document><document><id>1434</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Quantitative and qualitative platelet abnormalities during pregnancy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>In a 1-year period, 15 of 4048 pregnant women were found to have thrombocytopenia during their first prenatal visit.

Six patients had detectable platelet antibodies. Neonatal thrombocytopenia was found in one term infant of a patient with mild thrombocytopenia and negative platelet antibodies. This study suggests that mild, transient, isolated thrombocytopenia can occur in an otherwise normal pregnancy and its incidence may be lower than previously reported. Extensive testing is not indicated unless there is an associated prolonged bleeding time.

The extraordinary conservation of the PAX6 protein at the amino acid level amongst vertebrates predicts that pathological missense mutations should in fact be common even though they are hardly ever seen in aniridia patients . This indicates that there is a heavy ascertainment bias in the selection of patients for PAX6 mutation analysis and that the missing PAX6 missense mutations frequently may underlie phenotypes distinct from textbook aniridia . Here we present four novel PAX6 missense mutations , two in association with atypical phenotypes  ectopia pupillae ( displaced pupils ) and congenital nystagmus ( searching gaze ) , and two in association with more recognizable aniridia phenotypes . Strikingly , all four mutations are located within the PAX6 paired domain and affect amino acids which are highly conserved in all known paired domain proteins .

Like p53, p73 can bind to DNA and activate transcription. Using PCR-SSCP and gene sequencing, we analyzed the TP53 and TP73 genes in a case of a grade III anaplastic astrocytoma that progressed to glioblastoma. We found a deletion of AAG at position 595-597 of TP53 (exon 6), resulting in the deletion of Glu 199 in the protein and a genomic polymorphism of TP73, identified as an A-to-G change, at position E8/+15 at intron 8 (IVS8-15A>G). The mutation found at exon 6 of the gene TP53 could be associated with the rapid tumoral progression found in this case, since the mutated p53 may inactivate the wild-type p53 and the p73alpha protein, which was conserved here, leading to an increase in cellular instability.</text></passage></document><document><id>1437</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>No correlation between the molecular subtype of COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene and the clinico-histopathological features of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>152</offset></passage></document><document><id>1438</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 5272-1G>A and BRCA2 5374delTATG are founder mutations of high relevance for genetic counselling in breast/ovarian cancer families of Spanish origin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>155</offset><text>The distribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ line mutations in breast/ovarian cancer families varies among different populations, which typically present a wide spectrum of unique mutations.

In the last few years it has emerged that gene fusions, caused by chromosome translocations, inversions, deletions, etc., are important in the common epithelial cancers, such as prostate and lung carcinoma. Most prostate cancers, for example, have an androgen-regulated fusion of one of the ETS transcription factor gene family. Early results of genome-wide searches for gene fusions in breast and other epithelial cancers suggest that most individual tumours will have several fused genes. Fusion genes are exceptionally powerful mutations. In their simplest form they can turn on expression by promoter insertion but they can also, for example, force dimerization of a protein or change its subcellular location. They are correspondingly important clinically, in classification and management and as targets for therapy. This review surveys what we know of fusion genes in the carcinomas, summarizes the technical advances that now make it possible to search systematically for such genes, and concludes by putting fusion genes into the current picture of mutation in cancers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1442</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Congenital goitrous hypothyroidism, deafness and iodide organification defect in four siblings: Pendred or pseudo-Pendred syndrome?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>132</offset><text>Pendred syndrome (PDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness, goiter and iodide organification defect.

It has been recently demonstrated that some families with features of PDS do not have the inner ear malformations and mutations in the PDS gene. This condition has been named as "pseudo-Pendred syndrome" (pseudo-PDS), and has been hypothesized to be of autoimmune origin.

His medical history included excision of a lumbar dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) 5 years previously. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a mass arising from the greater curvature of the stomach. Upper GI endoscopy was normal. He underwent successful laparoscopic resection of this mass. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The histology of the abdominal mass revealed a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with poor prognostic indicators. Immunohistochemical analysis of the GIST and his previous DFSP was performed. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry suggested a link between the GIST and his previous DFSP involving the PDGF signalling system. DISCUSSION: Both GIST and DFSP are extremely rare tumors. A mutation in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-alpha) has been described in 5-15% of GISTs. It has been shown that DFSP is frequently associated with a translocation between PDGF-B (Chr 22) and COL1A1 (Chr 17), causing continuous activation of PDGFR-beta. Literature review confirms that there are no previously reported cases of both of these tumors occurring in the same patient. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that this patient may have a previously undescribed genetic mutation involving the PDGF signalling system, resulting in these two very rare malignancies. Immunohistochemistry studies confirmed the link on this occasion. Improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology of the PDGF system may novel therapeutic targets in the future.</text></passage></document><document><id>1444</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The immunogenetics of hereditary hemochromatosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>50</offset><text>Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload disease caused by unregulated intestinal iron absorption, is a recessive HLA-linked disease. HH is the most common inherited metabolic disorder with one of every 400 to 500 individuals having both genes and being likely to develop the disease. Thus, although the product of the hemochromatosis gene is unknown, its mode of inheritance allows HLA-genotyping of the proband and his/her siblings to be highly predictive of the genetic propensity to develop the clinical features of HH. In view of the known immunoregulatory properties of iron and its binding proteins, it is important to determine if the high levels of storage iron in HH influence the immunosurveillance network in HH patients and whether that has any clinical relevance. We have defined certain alterations of the effector cells of the cellular arm of the immune system and have studied a patient with HH who had specific immune alterations, including delayed cutaneous-type hypersensitivity anergy, and was diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach four years after his HH diagnosis. Those findings are consistent with the interpretation that in certain clinical situations of elevated body iron stores, the immunoregulatory balance or environment may be tipped in favor of growth and development of cancer cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>1445</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical features and linkage analysis for a Chinese family with autosomal dominant central areolar choroidal dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>BACKGROUND: A Chinese family with autosomal dominant central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD) was identified. The purpose of this study was to collect the clinical findings from the family and to identify the genetic entity by linkage analysis. METHODS: Forty-three individuals from 3 generations of the family underwent ophthalmologic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, examination of the anterior segments, and inspection of the ocular fundus after pharmacologic mydriasis. Affected family members further underwent color vision test, color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, automated perimetry, and electroretinography. The family was followed up for 30 months. Peripheral venous blood or buccal swabs were collected from each family member and genomic DNA was extracted. Linkage analysis was performed for candidate genes or loci using microsatellite markers. RESULTS: Seven family members in 3 continuous generations were diagnosed as having autosomal dominant CACD. The family showed progressive development of the disease, affecting both male and female. Age of onset of visual disturbances varied between 11 and 50 years. Phenotypic variability among affected individuals was apparent and ranged from relatively normal-appearing fundus with mild parafoveal pigment mottling to geographic atrophy of the macula. Fluorescein angiography showed hyperfluorescent parafoveal changes in early stage or well-demarcated area of chorioretinal atrophy with enhanced visibility of the residual underlying choroidal vessels in the late stage. Peripheral retina and visual fields were normal in affected individuals. Electroretinogram showed normal or mild reduction in the photopic amplitude. Eight candidate genes (STGD4, RCD1, peripherin/RDS, GUCA1A, RIMS1, UNC119, GUCY2D, and AIPL1) and two genetic loci (4p15.2 - 16.3, and 17p13) were excluded to be responsible for the disease by linkage analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical findings of this Chinese family with CACD shared similarities with previously reported families of other ethnicities. Linkage analysis excluded the known genes and genetic loci, indicating genetic heterogeneity of the disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1446</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations of the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome gene in patients presenting with refractory cytopenia--do we have to screen?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>128</offset></passage></document><document><id>1447</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Heteroduplex repair in extracts of human HeLa cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>A general repair process for DNA heteroduplexes has been detected in HeLa cell extracts. Using a variety of M13mp2 DNA substrates containing single-base mismatches and extra nucleotides, extensive repair is observed after incubation with HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts and subsequent transfection of bacterial cells with the treated DNA. Most, but not all, mispairs as well as two frameshift heteroduplexes are repaired efficiently. Parallel measurements of repair in HeLa extracts and in Escherichia coli suggest that repair specificities are similar for the two systems. The presence of a nick in the molecule is required for efficient repair in HeLa cell extracts, and the strand containing the nick is the predominantly repaired strand. Mismatch-dependent DNA synthesis is observed when radiolabeled restriction fragments, produced by reaction of the extract with heteroduplex and homoduplex molecules, are compared. Specific labeling of fragments, representing a region of approximately 1,000 base pairs and containing the nick and the mismatch, is detected for the heteroduplex substrate but not the homoduplex. The repair reaction is complete after 20 min and requires added Mg2+, ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system, but not dNTPs, which are present at sufficient levels in the extract. An inhibitor of DNA polymerase beta, dideoxythimidine 5'-triphosphate, does not inhibit mismatch-specific DNA synthesis. Aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilom, inhibits both semiconservative replication and repair synthesis in the extract. Butylphenyl-dGTP also inhibits both replicative and repair synthesis but at a concentration known to inhibit DNA polymerase alpha preferentially rather than delta or epsilon. This suggests that DNA polymerase alpha may function in mismatch repair.</text></passage></document><document><id>1448</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prohibitin, an evolutionarily conserved intracellular protein that blocks DNA synthesis in normal fibroblasts and HeLa cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>Genes that act inside the cell to negatively regulate proliferation are of great interest because of their implications for such processes as development and cancer, but these genes have been difficult to clone.

Using standard procedures of auxotroph enrichment with this cell line, we have isolated tyrosine auxotrophs for the first time. We report in this paper the class of auxotrophs with (a) reduced (15-64% of wild type) or (b) absent activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzymic component of the phenylalanine hydroxylating system. This class of auxotroph presumably contains either lower (a) [or zero (b)] levels of normal phenylalanine hydroxylase protein than wild type, or mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase protein with lowered (or zero) activity. The two subgroups of auxotrophs (a) and (b) differ from each other in their revertibility and their growth behavior in the tyrosine-free medium. Over a 12-month period of testing, the auxotrophs have been highly stable with respect to their phenylalanine hydroxylase activity and growth phenotype in tyrosine-free medium. Such auxotrophs should facilitate genetic and biochemical study of the genes controlling the phenylalanine hydroxylation system and the study of phenylketonuria.</text></passage></document><document><id>1453</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Stoichiometry of base excision repair proteins correlates with increased somatic CAG instability in striatum over cerebellum in Huntington's disease transgenic mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>166</offset><text>Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of an unstable CAG repeat in the coding sequence of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Instability affects both germline and somatic cells. Somatic instability increases with age and is tissue-specific. In particular, the CAG repeat sequence in the striatum, the brain region that preferentially degenerates in HD, is highly unstable, whereas it is rather stable in the disease-spared cerebellum. The mechanisms underlying the age-dependence and tissue-specificity of somatic CAG instability remain obscure. Recent studies have suggested that DNA oxidation and OGG1, a glycosylase involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine lesions, contribute to this process. We show that in HD mice oxidative DNA damage abnormally accumulates at CAG repeats in a length-dependent, but age- and tissue-independent manner, indicating that oxidative DNA damage alone is not sufficient to trigger somatic instability. Protein levels and activities of major base excision repair (BER) enzymes were compared between striatum and cerebellum of HD mice. Strikingly, 5'-flap endonuclease activity was much lower in the striatum than in the cerebellum of HD mice. Accordingly, Flap Endonuclease-1 (FEN1), the main enzyme responsible for 5'-flap endonuclease activity, and the BER cofactor HMGB1, both of which participate in long-patch BER (LP-BER), were also significantly lower in the striatum compared to the cerebellum. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that POLbeta was specifically enriched at CAG expansions in the striatum, but not in the cerebellum of HD mice. These in vivo data fit a model in which POLbeta strand displacement activity during LP-BER promotes the formation of stable 5'-flap structures at CAG repeats representing pre-expanded intermediate structures, which are not efficiently removed when FEN1 activity is constitutively low. We propose that the stoichiometry of BER enzymes is one critical factor underlying the tissue selectivity of somatic CAG expansion.</text></passage></document><document><id>1454</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Transient salt wasting in POMC-deficiency due to infection induced stress.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>Obesity is a multifactorial disorder influenced by genetic, behavioral, environmental and cultural factors. A twelve month old male patient was admitted to the hospital because of malaise, irritability, disquietness and obesity. His BMI was 19.8 kg/m (2) and BMI SDS was 1.38. Mental development was normal, and motor skills were mildly delayed most probably due to his obesity. His physical examination was totally normal except obesity and red hair. A history of hypoglycemia on the fourth day of life, which resolved after oral glucose administration, was reported. The child had been hyperphagic from the first weeks of life and had aggressive behavior when food was denied. The body weight of the patient increased dramatically during the first year of life. Based on the clinical features and laboratory findings (the overgrowth syndrome, red hair, hypoglycemia and hypocortisolism) the patient was diagnosed as POMC deficiency and the diagnosis was confirmed by genetic studies. Hypoglycemia and apnea episodes ceased as he was put on hydrocortisone but he developed relative mineralocorticoid deficiency during a urinary tract infection. In POMC deficiency, relative mineralocorticoid deficiency should be in mind in episodes of severe stress and therapy should be initiated.</text></passage></document><document><id>1455</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Screening for founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in unselected Jewish women.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>PURPOSE: There are two mutations in BRCA1 and one mutation in BRCA2 that are present in up to 2.5% of Ashkenazi Jewish women. Current guidelines for testing stipulate that a personal or family history of cancer be present to be eligible for testing. To date, population screening in this population has not been suggested. However, this may be rational. Little is known about the appropriateness of testing guidelines for the Jewish population or the level of interest in testing. METHODS: Eligible subjects were women who self-identified as Jewish, who were between the ages of 25 and 80 years, and who resided in Ontario. Subjects were recruited through an article in a national newspaper. Women were asked to complete a study questionnaire and a family history questionnaire and to provide a blood or saliva sample. The risk of carrying a BRCA mutation was estimated for each woman. Results A total of 2,080 women were enrolled onto the study. The overall mutation prevalence was 1.1% (0.5% for BRCA1 and 0.6% for BRCA2). Among the 22 mutation carriers, the mean estimate of carrying a BRCA mutation was 3.9%. Ten (45%) of the 22 women met the current Ontario Ministry of Health Guidelines criteria for testing. CONCLUSION: There is considerable interest for genetic testing among Jewish women at low risk of carrying a mutation. However, many women with mutations are ineligible for genetic testing under current guidelines. Approximately 1% of Jewish women carry a BRCA mutation, and these women should be considered to be candidates for genetic testing.</text></passage></document><document><id>1456</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BAC array CGH in patients with Velocardiofacial syndrome-like features reveals genomic aberrations on chromosome region 1q21.1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>128</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Microdeletion of the chromosome 22q11.2 region is the most common genetic aberration among patients with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) but a subset of subjects do not show alterations of this chromosome region. METHODS: We analyzed 18 patients with VCFS-like features by comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) array and performed a face-to-face slide hybridization with two different arrays: a whole genome and a chromosome 22-specific BAC array. Putative rearrangements were confirmed by FISH and MLPA assays. RESULTS: One patient carried a combination of rearrangements on 1q21.1, consisting in a microduplication of 212 kb and a close microdeletion of 1.15 Mb, previously reported in patients with variable phenotypes, including mental retardation, congenital heart defects (CHD) and schizophrenia. While 326 control samples were negative for both 1q21.1 rearrangements, one of 73 patients carried the same 212-kb microduplication, reciprocal to TAR microdeletion syndrome. Also, we detected four copy number variants (CNVs) inherited from one parent (a 744-kb duplication on 10q11.22; a 160 kb duplication and deletion on 22q11.21 in two cases; and a gain of 140 kb on 22q13.2), not present in control subjects, raising the potential role of these CNVs in the VCFS-like phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed aCGH as a successful strategy in order to characterize additional submicroscopic aberrations in patients with VCF-like features that fail to show alterations in 22q11.2 region. We report a 212-kb microduplication on 1q21.1, detected in two patients, which may contribute to CHD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1457</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>High frequency of multiexonic deletion of the GCH1 gene in a Taiwanese cohort of dopa-response dystonia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>Large deletions in the GCH1 gene have been reported in a minority of cases of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). In this study, we performed an extensive clinical and genetic investigation of 22 affected members in eight families. Sequence analysis revealed five different mutations in five families (n = 10); Ser81Pro (novel), Ser76X, Gly203Arg, 249del A, and IVS5 + 3insT. Applying multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, we detected a large heterozygous deletion of exons 1-3 in the remaining three families (n = 12), which was verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Therefore, the large deletion accounted for 37.5% of the total families and 55% of our DRD population. The deletion appeared to have high penetrance and was associated with multifocal dystonia and adult onset in males. Adult-onset patients were commonly presenting with resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, indistinguishable from those in Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, a high frequency of multiexonic deletion of GCH1 was identified in the Taiwanese DRD population. By dosage analysis, we were able to detect a mutation in all patients. Our study demonstrates that dosage analysis is necessary for molecular diagnostics in DRD patients of Han Chinese ethnicity.</text></passage></document><document><id>1458</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Rapid identification of HEXA mutations in Tay-Sachs patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>62</offset><text>Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder due to mutations in the HEXA gene resulting in a beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) deficiency. The purpose of this study was to characterize the molecular abnormalities in patients with infantile or later-onset forms of the disease. The complete sequencing of the 14 exons and flanking regions of the HEXA gene was performed with a unique technical condition in 10 unrelated TSD patients. Eleven mutations were identified, including five splice mutations, one insertion, two deletions and three single-base substitutions. Four mutations were novel: two splice mutations (IVS8+5G>A, IVS2+4delAGTA), one missense mutation in exon 6 (c.621T>G (p.D207E)) and one small deletion (c.1211-1212delTG) in exon 11 resulting in a premature stop codon at residue 429. The c.621T>G missense mutation was found in a patient presenting an infantile form. Its putative role in the pathogenesis of TSD is suspected as residue 207 is highly conserved in human, mouse and rat. Moreover, structural modelling predicted changes likely to affect substrate binding and catalytic activity of the enzyme. The time-saving procedure reported here could be useful for the characterization of Tay-Sachs-causing mutations, in particular in non-Ashkenazi patients mainly exhibiting rare mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1459</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prevalence of the I1307K APC gene variant in Israeli Jews of differing ethnic origin and risk for colorectal cancer. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS  Israeli Jews of European birth , i . e . , Ashkenazim , have the highest colorectal cancer incidence of any Israeli ethnic group .

Herein, we report a clinical and genetic analysis of three Korean patients with clinical features consistent with CdLS. A male neonate had distinctive facial features, malformations of the upper extremities, genital abnormalities, and bilateral hearing loss, while a 6-yr-old boy and a 10-yr-old girl had distinctive facial features, short stature, and mental retardation. There were no chromosomal abnormalities in the three children. Sequence analysis of the NIPBL gene revealed three novel NIPBL variations including c.6108+2T>C, c.4028A>C (p.His1343Pro), and c.218C>T (p.Ser73Leu) in each patient, respectively. The first two variations appear to be de novo mutations causing CdLS in the patients because they are absent in the patients' parents. The p.Ser73Leu variation, however, seems to be a polymorphism since it is found both in the patient and in her asymptomatic mother.

However, for both loci any role in the regulation of energy or fat metabolism is not yet described. In this study, we validated and refined gene structure, screened for mRNA splice variants and analyzed the tissue-specific gene expression patterns of both loci as a prerequisite to elucidate their potential physiological function. Based on comparative sequence analysis, a new full-length gene model for the bovine IRAK1 gene was developed and confirmed experimentally. Expression of IRAK1 mRNA was found in a variety of tissues, and a splice variant was identified in skeletal muscle caused by an in-frame deleted segment of 210 bp affecting regions of intrinsic disorder in the respective protein. For the locus LOC618944, our data contributed to a revised gene model and its assignment to BTA23 (bovine chromosome 23) on the current bovine genome assembly supported by comparative similarity analysis between the bovine and human genomes and experimental data. Furthermore, we identified several splice variants in mammary gland, fat and skeletal muscle tissue and detected a highly similar processed pseudogene on BTA26. All transcript variants of LOC618944 detected in the analyzed tissues represent noncoding RNAs. For both loci, our results suggest yet undetected physiological functions in tissues relevant for fat or energy metabolism in cattle.</text></passage></document><document><id>1466</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Binding and uptake of H-ferritin are mediated by human transferrin receptor-1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>Ferritin is a spherical molecule composed of 24 subunits of two types, ferritin H chain (FHC) and ferritin L chain (FLC). Ferritin stores iron within cells, but it also circulates and binds specifically and saturably to a variety of cell types. For most cell types, this binding can be mediated by ferritin composed only of FHC (HFt) but not by ferritin composed only of FLC (LFt), indicating that binding of ferritin to cells is mediated by FHC but not FLC. By using expression cloning, we identified human transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) as an important receptor for HFt with little or no binding to LFt. In vitro, HFt can be precipitated by soluble TfR1, showing that this interaction is not dependent on other proteins. Binding of HFt to TfR1 is partially inhibited by diferric transferrin, but it is hindered little, if at all, by HFE. After binding of HFt to TfR1 on the cell surface, HFt enters both endosomes and lysosomes. TfR1 accounts for most, if not all, of the binding of HFt to mitogen-activated T and B cells, circulating reticulocytes, and all cell lines that we have studied. The demonstration that TfR1 can bind HFt as well as Tf raises the possibility that this dual receptor function may coordinate the processing and use of iron by these iron-binding molecules.</text></passage></document><document><id>1467</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>VHL frameshift mutation as target of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in Drosophila melanogaster and human HEK293 cell line.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>There are many well-studied examples of human phenotypes resulting from nonsense or frameshift mutations that are modulated by Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD), a process that typically degrades transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) in order to prevent translation of unnecessary or aberrant transcripts.

The effects of the common genetic variants (HFE H63D and/or TfC2) on brain iron were studied across eight brain regions (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, hippocampus, white matter of frontal lobe, genu, and splenium of corpus callosum) in 66 healthy adults (35 men, 31 women) aged 55 to 76. The iron content of ferritin molecules (ferritin iron) in the brain was measured with MRI utilizing the Field Dependent Relaxation Rate Increase (FDRI) method. 47% of the sample carried neither genetic variant (IRON-) and 53% carried one and/or the other (IRON+). IRON+ men had significantly higher FDRI compared to IRON- men (p=0.013). This genotype effect was not observed in women who, as expected, had lower FDRI than men. This is the first published evidence that these highly prevalent genetic variants in iron metabolism genes can influence brain iron levels in men. Clinical phenomena such as differential gender-associated risks of developing neurodegenerative diseases and age at onset may be associated with interactions between iron genes and brain iron accumulation. Clarifying mechanisms of brain iron accumulation may help identify novel interventions for age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</text></passage></document><document><id>1470</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Phenotype determining alleles in GM1 gangliosidosis patients bearing novel GLB1 mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>GM1 gangliosidosis manifests with progressive psychomotor deterioration and dysostosis of infantile, juvenile, or adult onset, caused by alterations in the structural gene coding for lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (GLB1).

The APC-activated Asef stimulates the small GTPase Cdc42, which leads to decreased cell-cell adherence and enhanced cell migration. In colorectal cancers, truncated APC constitutively activates Asef and promotes cancer cell migration and angiogenesis. Here, we report crystal structures of the human APC/Asef complex. We find that the armadillo repeat domain of APC uses a highly conserved surface groove to recognize the APC-binding region (ABR) of Asef, conformation of which changes dramatically upon binding to APC. Key residues on APC and Asef for the complex formation were mutated and their importance was demonstrated by binding and activity assays. Structural superimposition of the APC/Asef complex with autoinhibited Asef suggests that the binding between APC and Asef might create a steric clash between Asef-DH domain and APC, which possibly leads to a conformational change in Asef that stimulates its GEF activity. Our structures thus elucidate the molecular mechanism of Asef recognition by APC, as well as provide a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention against cancers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1472</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A recurrent 14q32.2 microdeletion mediated by expanded TGG repeats.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>Nearly all recurrent microdeletion/duplication syndromes described to date are characterized by the presence of flanking low copy repeats that act as substrates for non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) leading to the loss, gain or disruption of dosage sensitive genes. We describe an identical 1.11 Mb heterozygous deletion of 14q32.2 including the DLK1/GTL2 imprinted gene cluster in two unrelated patients. In both patients, the deleted chromosome 14 was of paternal origin, and consistent with this both exhibit clinical features compatible with uniparental disomy (UPD) (14)mat. Using a high-resolution oligonucleotide array, we mapped the breakpoints of this recurrent deletion to large flanking (TGG)(n) tandem repeats, each approximately 500 bp in size and sharing > or =88% homology. These expanded (TGG)(n) motifs share features with known fragile sites and are predicted to form strong guanine quadruplex secondary structures. We suggest that this recurrent deletion is mediated either by NAHR between the TGG repeats, or alternatively results from their inherent instability and/or strong secondary structure. Our results define a recurrent microdeletion of the 14q32.2 imprinted gene cluster mediated by flanking (TGG)(n) repeats, identifying a novel mechanism of recurrent genomic rearrangement. Our observation that expanded repeats can act as catalysts for genomic rearrangement extends the role of triplet repeats in human disease, raising the possibility that similar repeat structures may act as substrates for pathogenic rearrangements genome-wide.</text></passage></document><document><id>1473</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Plasma amine oxidase activities in Norrie disease patients with an X-chromosomal deletion affecting monoamine oxidase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>Two individuals with an X-chromosomal deletion were recently found to lack the genes encoding monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) and MAO-B.

These results indicate that plasma AO is encoded by gene(s) independent of those for MAO-A and MAO-B, and raise the possibility that plasma AO, and perhaps the closely related tissue AO, benzylamine oxidase, as well as other atypical AOs or MAOs encoded independently from MAO-A and MAO-B may contribute to the oxidative deamination of dopamine and 5-HT in humans.</text></passage></document><document><id>1474</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Oncogenic KRAS is not necessary for Wnt signalling activation in APC-associated FAP adenomas.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Recent studies have suggested that APC loss alone may be insufficient to promote aberrant Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Our aim was to comprehensively characterize Wnt signalling components in a set of APC-associated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) tumours. Sixty adenomas from six FAP patients with known pathogenic APC mutations were included. Somatic APC and KRAS mutations, beta-catenin immunostaining, and qRT-PCR of APC, MYC, AXIN2 and SFRP1 were analysed. Array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was also assessed in 26 FAP adenomas and 24 paired adenoma-carcinoma samples. A somatic APC alteration was present in 15 adenomas (LOH in 11 and four point mutations). KRAS mutations were detected in 10% of the cases. APC mRNA was overexpressed in adenomas. MYC and AXIN2 were also overexpressed, with significant intra-case heterogeneity. Increased cytoplasmic and/or nuclear beta-catenin staining was seen in 94% and 80% of the adenomas. beta-Catenin nuclear staining was strongly associated with MYC levels (p value 0.03) but not with KRAS mutations. Copy number aberrations were rare. However, the recurrent chromosome changes observed more frequently contained Wnt pathway genes (p value 0.012). Based on beta-catenin staining and Wnt pathway target genes alterations the Wnt pathway appears to be constitutively activated in all APC-FAP tumours, with alterations occurring both upstream and downstream of APC. Wnt aberrations are present at both the DNA and the RNA level. Somatic profiling of APC-FAP tumours provides new insights into the role of APC in tumourigenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1475</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PTEN, a putative protein tyrosine phosphatase gene mutated in human brain, breast, and prostate cancer. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>Mapping of homozygous deletions on human chromosome 10q23 has led to the isolation of a candidate tumor suppressor gene , PTEN , that appears to be mutated at considerable frequency in human cancers .

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by the defect of dystrophin, and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is caused by an abnormal fukutin gene leading to the glycosylation defect of alpha-dystroglycan. Dystrobrevin is one member of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex and its binding partners include dysbindin, syncoilin, and beta-synemin (desmuslin). Dysbindin is reported to be upregulated at the protein level in mdx mouse muscles, and syncoilin protein is also reported to be upregulated in biopsied muscles with neuromuscular disorders. In the present study we measured mRNA levels of dysbindin, syncoilin, and beta-synemin in biopsied muscles with DMD and FCMD. Upregulation of human dysbindin mRNA was observed in DMD muscles in comparison with normal muscles (p &lt; .05). The differences in human syncoilin and beta-synemin mRNA ratios between DMD and normal muscles were not statistically significant, although upregulation tendency of human syncoilin mRNA was noted in DMD muscles (.05 &lt; p &lt; .1). Furthermore, the differences of human dysbindin, syncoilin, and beta-synemin mRNA ratios between FCMD and normal muscles were not statistically significant. These data provide insight into the pathophysiology of these muscular dystrophies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1477</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene polymorphisms and longevity syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>PURPOSE: High levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Subjects with high levels of HDL cholesterol (>70 mg/dl; 1.79 mmol/l) as well as high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, could represent a group with longevity syndrome (LS). Since HDL particles are influenced by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, it is worth studying the CETP polymorphism. The aim of the study was to detect whether 2 genetic variants of the CETP are associated with the LS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 136 unrelated men and women with no personal and family history of CHD; 69 met the criteria for LS and 67 did not meet these criteria and had "normal" HDL cholesterol (>40 and &lt;70 mg/dl; >1.03 and &lt;1.79 mmol/l). All patients were genotyped for the TaqIB and I405V polymorphisms. RESULTS: The B2 allele frequency of TaqIB polymorphism was higher in the LS in comparison with the non-LS group (p=0.03) whereas B1 allele frequency was higher in the non-LS group (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Gene polymorphisms could help decide whether individuals who have increased levels of both LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol require treatment. Some of the prerequisites could include that subjects with LS should not only have very high levels of HDL cholesterol but also favorable gene polymorphisms. However, further investigations with a larger sample and including other gene polymorphisms, are needed.</text></passage></document><document><id>1478</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Coverage of the genetic background of breast cancer in the polish population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset></passage></document><document><id>1479</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Oligoclonality, impaired class switch and B-cell memory responses in WHIM syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>Heterozygous truncating mutations in CXCR4 have been identified as a cause of WHIM syndrome (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, immunodeficiency and myelokathexis).

We confirmed profound B-cell lymphopenia and demonstrated oligoclonality of the circulating B-cell pool by HCDR3 spectratyping. The response to immunization was studied in one subject utilizing a bacteriophage PhiX174 immunization protocol. Spectratyping showed oligoclonality at baseline with normalization of the HCDR3 length distribution by 5 months after immunization with PhiX174 with eventual return to the baseline state. Isotype switching from phage specific neutralizing antibody of the IgM class to IgG was markedly reduced. Overall, these data suggest that impaired CXCR4 signaling in WHIM syndrome results in defective B-cell function and abnormal isotype switching, possibly through effects on germinal center trafficking of lymphocytes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1480</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A histological study of eye abnormalities in the C57 black strain of mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset></passage></document><document><id>1481</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Galactosemia diagnosis gets an upgrade.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>40</offset></passage></document><document><id>1482</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Type 1 von Willebrand disease due to reduced von Willebrand factor synthesis and/or survival: observations from a case series.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>It may be difficult to diagnose type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) because of its heterogeneous and sometimes elusive nature.

A shorter VWF survival was observed in patients with C1130F mutations (T(1/2) elimination [T(1/2)el]=4.6+/-1.0h vs normal=15.8+/-2.3h, P&lt;0.0001), in those with other missense mutations investigated (T(1/2)el=9.5+/-0.9h, P&lt;0.02), and in patients not carrying VWF mutations (T(1/2)el=7.0+/-0.7h, P&lt;0.001); the decrease mainly depended on a greater VWF clearance. VWF survival and clearance were normal in patients who carried nonsense mutations. The VWF-propeptide-to-VWF-antigen (VWF:Ag) ratio (VWFpp ratio) was higher in patients with a shorter VWF survival, and the values were inversely correlated with the VWF half-life (P&lt;0.01). The response of VWF to DDAVP administration, which is useful to explore the synthesis and storage of VWF, was normal in patients with no mutations, whereas it decreased in patients with missense and nonsense mutations. Three scenarios, thus, are recognizable in type 1 VWD; one is associated mainly with a shorter survival of VWF, another is associated with its reduced synthesis and release, and a third is characterized by a combination of the two. The shorter VWF half-life found in patients with no VWF mutations suggests that mechanisms other than VWF might be involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 VWD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1483</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel missense mutation in cathepsin K (CTSK) gene in a consanguineous Pakistani family with pycnodysostosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Deficiency of cathepsin K (CTSK), a lysosomal cysteine protease, has been shown earlier as a cause of an autosomal recessive osteosclerotic skeletal dysplasia pycnodysostosis. The objective of the present study was to identify the potential sequence variants in CTSK gene in a large consanguineous Pakistani family with pycnodysostosis. METHODS: Genotyping of 4 affected and 6 unaffected members of the family was performed using polymorphic microsatellite markers linked to CTSK gene on chromosome 1q21. To screen for pathogenic mutation, exons and splice junctions of CTSK gene were polymerase chain reaction amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced directly in an automated DNA sequencer. RESULTS: Microsatellite analysis showed linkage of the family to CTSK gene on chromosome 1q21. Sequence analysis revealed a novel missense mutation c.728G>A (p.G243E) in exon 6 of the CTSK gene.

RNA interference has potential as a therapeutic approach but raises the issue of the role of wild-type ataxin-3 (WT ATX3) in MJD and of whether the expression of the wild-type protein must be maintained. To address this issue, we both overexpressed and silenced WT ATX3 in a rat model of MJD. We showed that (i) overexpression of WT ATX3 did not protect against MJD pathology, (ii) knockdown of WT ATX3 did not aggravate MJD pathology and that (iii) non-allele-specific silencing of ataxin-3 strongly reduced neuropathology in a rat model of MJD.

Purified recombinant GhHL1 protein dephosphorylated both 3',5'-bisphosphate nucleotide and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, demonstrating dual 3',5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase activities. Overexpression of GhHL1 complemented yeast hal2 mutant and enhanced yeast growth under elevated NaCl or LiCl, showing a role in salt tolerance associated with ionic stress response.

In the silkworm, more than 100 gene mutation systems are related to aberrant color patterns. The melanism (mln) is a rare body color mutant that exhibits an easily distinguishable phenotype in both larval and adult silkworms. By positional cloning, we identified the candidate gene of the mln locus, Bm-iAANAT, whose homologous gene (Dat) converts dopamine into N-acetyldopamine, a precursor for N-acetyldopamine sclerotin in Drosophila. In the mln mutant, two types of abnormal Bm-iAANAT transcripts were identified, whose expression levels are markedly lower than the wild type (WT). Moreover, dopamine content was approximately twice as high in the sclerified tissues (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate) of the mutant as in WT, resulting in phenotypic differences between the two. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analyses showed that other genes involved in the melanin metabolism pathway were regulated by the aberrant Bm-iAANAT activity in mln mutant in different ways and degrees. We therefore propose that greater accumulation of dopamine results from the functional deficiency of Bm-iAANAT in the mutant, causing a darker pattern in the sclerified regions than in the WT. In summary, our results indicate that Bm-iAANAT is responsible for the color pattern of the silkworm mutant, mln. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a role for arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferases in color pattern mutation in Lepidoptera.</text></passage></document><document><id>1490</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Overview of the mutation spectrum in familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and Norrie disease with identification of 21 novel variants in FZD4, LRP5, and NDP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>158</offset><text>Wnt signaling is a crucial component of the cell machinery orchestrating a series of physiological processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Among the plethora of roles that Wnt signaling plays, its canonical branch regulates eye organogenesis and angiogenesis. Mutations in the genes encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor protein 5 (LRP5) and frizzled 4 (FZD4), acting as coreceptors for Wnt ligands, cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). Moreover, mutations in the gene encoding NDP, a ligand for these Wnt receptors, cause Norrie disease and FEVR. Both FEVR and Norrie disease share similar phenotypic characteristics, including abnormal vascularization of the peripheral retina and formation of fibrovascular masses in the eye that can lead to blindness. In this mutation update, we report 21 novel variants for FZD4, LRP5, and NDP, and discuss the putative functional consequences of missense mutations. In addition, we provide a comprehensive overview of all previously published variants in the aforementioned genes and summarize the phenotypic characteristics in mouse models carrying mutations in the orthologous genes. The increasing molecular understanding of Wnt signaling, related to ocular development and blood supply, offers more tools for accurate disease diagnosis that may be important in the development of therapeutic interventions.</text></passage></document><document><id>1491</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene and breast cancer susceptibility].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>71</offset><text>Breast cancer is bound up with the environment. As a consequence of DNA damage induced by environmental carcinogens, a number of sophisticated sensing and transduction systems are initiated and the signal is conveyed simultaneously to multiple effectors. This process ultimately results in cancer. The protein kinase Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) that encoded by ATM gene is the master regulator of DNA damage response. In this consecutive reaction, the protein kinase ATM responds to the DNA damage by phosphorylating a variety of downstream substrates, which plays an important role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer. After ATM gene mutate, DNA damaged could not be accurately repaired and finally accelerates breast cancer transformation and proliferation. With the further research of ATM gene structure, function and breast cancer susceptibility, the extensive attention is paid to the relationship between ATM gene and breast cancer susceptibility. We reviewed the research advances in breast cancer susceptibility in several aspects of ATM gene, including mutation, polymorphism and methylation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1492</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genotype-phenotype correlations in Lesch-Nyhan disease: moving beyond the gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan disease and its attenuated variants are caused by mutations in the HPRT1 gene, which encodes the purine recycling enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The mutations are heterogeneous, with more than 400 different mutations already documented. Prior efforts to correlate variations in the clinical phenotype with different mutations have suggested that milder phenotypes typically are associated with mutants that permit some residual enzyme function, whereas the most severe phenotype is associated with null mutants. However, multiple exceptions to this concept have been reported. In the current studies 44 HPRT1 mutations associated with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes were reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant enzymes were expressed in vitro and purified, and their kinetic properties were examined toward their substrates hypoxanthine, guanine, and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. The results provide strong evidence for a correlation between disease severity and residual catalytic activity of the enzyme (k(cat)) toward each of its substrates as well as several mechanisms that result in exceptions to this correlation. There was no correlation between disease severity and the affinity of the enzyme for its substrates (K(m)). These studies provide a valuable model for understanding general principles of genotype-phenotype correlations in human disease, as the mechanisms involved are applicable to many other disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>1493</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A multilocus linkage map of mouse chromosome 8.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>48</offset><text>We present a genetic linkage map of mouse chromosome 8 that spans 53 cM and includes eight cloned loci.

First, the ability of the method to detect known mutations and polymorphisms in the insulin-receptor coding sequence was assessed. Regions of the insulin-receptor sequence containing 16 different nucleotide changes, 9 in patient genomic DNA and 7 as cloned cDNA in plasmids, were analyzed. All 9 patient genomic DNA mutants and 5 of 7 plasmid mutants exhibited variant SSCP patterns. To investigate the potential of the technique for screening many patients, the 5 exons that encode the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor were examined in 30 unrelated white subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Exons 17-21 were amplified from genomic DNA with polymerase chain reaction and subjected to SSCP analysis. Exons 19, 20, and 21 revealed no bands of aberrant migration, suggesting a high degree of conservation of these sequences. One diabetic subject had an SSCP variant in exon 18. Direct sequencing of this subject's genomic DNA revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (Lys1068----Glu1068). Five different SSCP patterns were detected in exon 17. Based on direct sequencing, these patterns were explained by combinations of three different nucleotide substitutions, two of which were common silent polymorphisms. One subject had a heterozygous missense mutation Val985---- Met985. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed the presence of these mutations in the appropriate diabetic subjects and also detected the Val985 mutation in heterozygous form in 1 of 13 nondiabetic white subjects.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2007, 30 patients were diagnosed as having Wilson disease with an International Diagnostic Score of 4 or more. The phenotypes, genotypes and post-diagnostic courses of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients had ATP7B mutations responsible for Wilson disease. Four patients had a single mutant chromosome. There were 2 major mutations of 2333 G>T and 2871 delC (40%), and 6 novel mutations (13%) in our patients. The first clinical manifestation was the hepatic form in 22, neurological form in 5, and hemolysis in 3 patients. The hepatic form was diagnosed around the age of 13 years, followed by neurological complication with a time lag of 9 years. Thus, some patients, especially patients with the neurological form, did not undergo early diagnostic tests including ATP7B analysis. During the post-diagnosis period, 3 patients were hospitalized for recurrent liver disease, and 2 patients committed suicide. One female patient died from acute hepatic failure associated with encephalopathy after fertilization therapy, while 2 male patients recovered from encephalopathy-free, prolonged hepatic failure after noncompliance with drug therapy. The King's Scores for liver transplantation were below the cut-off in both cases. CONCLUSION: To minimize delayed diagnosis, ceruloplasmin determination and ATP7B analysis may be recommended to patients showing hepatic damage of unknown etiology. At gene diagnosis, appropriate management of patients including compliance education and emotional care to prevent suicide might be important.</text></passage></document><document><id>1499</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Translocation and deletion around SOX9 in a patient with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia and sex reversal.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>Campomelic dysplasia (MIM 114290) is a severe malformation syndrome frequently accompanied by male-to-female sex reversal. Causative are mutations within the SOX9 gene on 17q24.3 as well as chromosomal aberrations (translocations, inversions or deletions) in the vicinity of SOX9. Here, we report on a patient with muscular hypotonia, craniofacial dysmorphism, cleft palate, brachydactyly, malformations of thoracic spine, and gonadal dysgenesis with female external genitalia and m  llerian duct derivatives in the presence of a male karyotype. X-ray examination and clinical examinations revealed no signs of campomelia. The combination of molecular cytogenetic analysis and array CGH revealed an unbalanced translocation between one chromosome 7 and one chromosome 17 [46,XY,t(7;17)(q33;q24).ish t(7;17)(wcp7+,wcp17+;wcp7+wcp17+)] with a deletion of approximately 4.2 Mb located about 0.5 Mb upstream of SOX9. STS analysis confirmed the deletion of chromosome 17, which has occurred de novo on the paternal chromosome. The proximal breakpoint on chromosome 17 is localized outside the known breakpoint cluster regions. The deletion on chromosome 17q24 removes several genes. Among these genes PRKAR1A is deleted. Inactivating mutations of PRKAR1A cause Carney complex. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia, carrying both a deletion and a translocation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1500</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familiar ochronotic arthropathy-caused by a gene mutation traced three hundred years.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset><text>Authors trace an ochronotic Hungarian family, which moved from Slovakia to Hungary 300 years ago.

We found a heterozygote member of this family who has children with an alkaptonuria-homozygote and known-heterozygote genotypes so there would be a high risk of alkaptonuria in their offsprings.

The diagnostic value and clinical relevance of plasma lysoGb3 concentration was investigated. All male and adult female patients with classical Fabry disease could be discerned by an elevated plasma lysoGb3. In young pre-symptomatic Fabry heterozygotes, lysoGb3 levels can be normal. Individuals carrying the R112H and P60L mutations, without classical Fabry symptoms, showed no elevated plasma lysoGb3. Multiple regression analysis showed that there is no correlation of plasma lysoGb3 concentration with total disease severity score in Fabry males. However, plasma lysoGb3 concentration did correlate with white matter lesions (odds ratio: 6.1 per 100 nM lysoGb3 increase (95% CI: 1.4-25.9, p=0.015). In females, plasma lysoGb3 concentration correlated with overall disease severity. Furthermore, plasma lysoGb3 level was related to left ventricular mass (19.5+/-5.5 g increase per 10 nM lysoGb3 increase; p=0.001). In addition, it was assessed whether lifetime exposure to lysoGb3 correlates with disease manifestations. Male Fabry patients with a high lysoGb3 exposure (>10,000 U), were moderately or severely affected, only one mildly. Female patients with a low exposure (&lt;1000 U) were asymptomatic or mildly affected. A large proportion of the females with an exposure >1000 U showed disease complications. Plasma lysoGb3 is useful for the diagnosis of Fabry disease. LysoGb3 is an independent risk factor for development of cerebrovascular white matter lesions in male patients and left ventricular hypertrophy in females. Disease severity correlates with exposure to plasma lysoGb3.</text></passage></document><document><id>1502</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 mutations in women attending clinics that evaluate the risk of breast cancer. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>BACKGROUND  To define the incidence of BRCA1 mutations among patients seen in clinics that evaluate the risk of breast cancer , we analyzed DNA samples from women seen in this setting and constructed probability tables to provide estimates of the likelihood of finding a BRCA1 mutation in individual families . METHODS  Clinical information , family histories , and blood for DNA analysis were obtained from 263 women with breast cancer . Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing were used to identify BRCA1 mutations . RESULTS  BRCA1 mutations were identified in 16 percent of women with a family history of breast cancer . Only 7 percent of women from families with a history of breast cancer but not ovarian cancer had BRCA1 mutations . The rates were higher among women from families with a history of both breast and ovarian cancer . Among family members , an average age of less than 55 years at the diagnosis of breast cancer , the presence of ovarian cancer , the presence of breast and ovarian cancer in the same woman , and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry were all associated with an increased risk of detecting a BRCA1 mutation . No association was found between the presence of bilateral breast cancer or the number of breast cancers in a family and the detection of a BRCA1 mutation , or between the position of the mutation in the BRCA1 gene and the presence of ovarian cancer in a family . CONCLUSIONS  Among women with breast cancer and a family history of the disease , the percentage with BRCA1 coding-region mutations is less than the 45 percent predicted by genetic-linkage analysis . These results suggest that even in a referral clinic specializing in screening women from high-risk families , the majority of tests for BRCA1 mutations will be negative and therefore uninformative . . </text></passage></document><document><id>1503</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>High prevalence of fulminant hepatic failure among patients with mutant alleles for truncation of ATP7B in Wilson's disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Although many mutations of the Wilson's disease (WD) gene (ATP7B) have been reported, few data exist regarding the occurrence of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). We sought to determine if genotypic assignment according to type of protein-product could be related to the prevalence of FHF among patients with WD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed gene analysis in Japanese patients with WD as well as genotype-phenotype analysis in 51 patients. We divided genotypes into two groups according to type of ATP7B product: truncated group [T] consisted of two truncated alleles including nonsense, insertion, deletion, or splice site mutation, and missense group [M] consisted of one or two missense alleles. We also divided phenotypes into two groups: [FHF] group and [non-FHF] group. RESULTS: We were able to determine genotype in 42 patients. Genotypically, 11 patients were assigned to [T] group and 31 to [M] group. Phenotypically, 4 patients were [FHF] and 38 were [non-FHF]. All patients in [FHF] group belonged to [T] group. The prevalence of [FHF] in [T] group was 36.4% and was significantly higher than in [M] group (p &lt; 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that genotypes for truncation of ATP7B are associated with high prevalence of FHF.</text></passage></document><document><id>1504</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hematopoietic cell transplantation for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: advances in biology and future directions for treatment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked disorder characterized by a triad of diagnostic clinical elements: immunodeficiency, eczema, and hemorrhage caused by thrombocytopenia with small-sized platelets.

The uptake of inorganic iron (Fe) complexes compared to transferrin-bound Fe by these cells has been investigated to determine whether melanotransferrin has a role in Fe uptake. The mechanisms of Fe uptake have been characterised using 59Fe complexes of citrate, nitrilotriacetate, desferrioxamine, and 59Fe added to Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) and compared with human transferrin (Tf) labelled with 59Fe and iodine-125. Iron uptake from the Fe complexes of citrate, nitrilotriacetate and MEM were similar, and far greater than that from Tf at the same Fe concentration (2.5 microM). Ammonium chloride and a monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor (42/6), had no effect on the uptake of Fe from inorganic Fe complexes, suggesting that receptor-mediated endocytosis of Tf was not involved. The monoclonal antibody, 96.5, specific for melanotransferrin did not alter total Fe uptake but slightly increased the proportion of Fe internalised, possibly due to the modulation of the antigen by the antibody. However, from the time required for modulation to occur (approximately 2 h), the small increase in internalisation observed and the fact that no increase in total cell Fe occurred, it is suggested that melanotransferrin has little role in Fe uptake.</text></passage></document><document><id>1506</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Developmental perspectives on copy number abnormalities of the 22q11.2 region.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>The 22q11.2 chromosomal landscape predisposes to genomic rearrangements that are associated with a variety of clinical phenotypes.

However, it remains unclear whether Onuf's nucleus (ON), which plays major roles in the micturition reflex and voluntary continence, degenerates during the disease process. In the present study, we conducted a morphometric and immunohistochemical study of ON, together with the lateral nuclear group (LNG) of the sacral anterior horns, in seven patients with MJD. When compared with controls, the number of lower motor neurons in both ON and LNG was significantly smaller in the MJD patients, the former being inversely correlated with the size of the expanded CAG repeats. Notably, MJD patients with a large CAG-repeat expansion showed an ON-predominant pattern of neuronal loss, while in the remaining patients, ON and LNG were affected to a similar degree, or rather an LNG-predominant pattern of neuronal loss was evident. Moreover, when adjusted for age, the degree of neuronal loss in both ON and LNG was significantly correlated with the extent of expansion of the CAG repeats. In MJD, the remaining lower motor neurons in ON often exhibited ataxin-3- or 1C2-immunoreactive (ir) neuronal intranuclear inclusions, while no pTDP-43-ir neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were present in these neurons. In conclusion, the present findings strongly suggest that neuronal loss in ON, the degree of which is highly influenced by the extent of expansion of CAG repeats, is a consistent feature in MJD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1508</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Lipid exchange mechanism of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein clarified by atomistic and coarse-grained simulations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transports cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids between different lipoprotein fractions in blood plasma. The inhibition of CETP has been shown to be a sound strategy to prevent and treat the development of coronary heart disease. We employed molecular dynamics simulations to unravel the mechanisms associated with the CETP-mediated lipid exchange. To this end we used both atomistic and coarse-grained models whose results were consistent with each other. We found CETP to bind to the surface of high density lipoprotein (HDL) -like lipid droplets through its charged and tryptophan residues. Upon binding, CETP rapidly (in about 10 ns) induced the formation of a small hydrophobic patch to the phospholipid surface of the droplet, opening a route from the core of the lipid droplet to the binding pocket of CETP. This was followed by a conformational change of helix X of CETP to an open state, in which we found the accessibility of cholesteryl esters to the C-terminal tunnel opening of CETP to increase. Furthermore, in the absence of helix X, cholesteryl esters rapidly diffused into CETP through the C-terminal opening. The results provide compelling evidence that helix X acts as a lid which conducts lipid exchange by alternating the open and closed states. The findings have potential for the design of novel molecular agents to inhibit the activity of CETP.</text></passage></document><document><id>1509</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mapping the homolog of the human Rb1 gene to chromosome 14 of higher primates. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset><text>The Rb1 gene has been implicated with retinoblastoma and is located on human Chromosome ( Chr ) 13q14 . 2 2 .

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the associations among CETP genotype, phenotype, and blood pressure in a cohort of 521 older adults (who have complete data for the variables required in our primary analysis) enrolled between November 1, 1998, and June 30, 2003, in our ongoing studies of genes associated with longevity, including a cohort with a high prevalence of a genotype coding for a reduced activity variant of CETP and low levels of CETP. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was actually lower among homozygotes for the variant CETP (48% vs 60% among those with wild-type and 65% among heterozygotes; P=.03). Low levels of CETP were associated with reduced prevalence of hypertension (65% in highest tertile, 59% in middle tertile, and 55% in lowest tertile; P=.04) and lower systolic blood pressure (140.8, 138.1, 136.2 mm Hg, respectively; P=.03). CONCLUSION: Reduced levels of CETP are associated with lower, not higher, blood pressure. The adverse results with torcetrapib, if mediated through blood pressure, are likely to represent effects of this specific drug, rather than a result of lower CETP levels.</text></passage></document><document><id>1511</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Adult onset Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1D with an Arg381Cys mutation of EGR2.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset></passage></document><document><id>1512</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Deletion of von Hippel-Lindau in glomerular podocytes results in glomerular basement membrane thickening, ectopic subepithelial deposition of collagen {alpha}1{alpha}2{alpha}1(IV), expression of neuroglobin, and proteinuria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>225</offset><text>Vascular endothelial growth factor, which is critical for blood vessel formation, is regulated by hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs). A component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) facilitates oxygen-dependent polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIFalpha subunits. Hypothesizing that deletion of podocyte VHL would result in HIFalpha hyperstabilization, we crossed podocin promoter-Cre transgenic mice, which express Cre recombinase in podocytes beginning at the capillary loop stage of glomerular development, with floxed VHL mice. Vascular patterning and glomerular development appeared unaltered in progeny lacking podocyte VHL. However, urinalysis showed increased albumin excretion by 4 weeks when compared with wild-type littermates with several sever cases (>1000 microg/ml). Many glomerular ultrastructural changes were seen in mutants, including focal subendothelial delamination and widespread podocyte foot process broadening, and glomerular basement membranes (GBMs) were significantly thicker in 16-week-old mutants compared with controls. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy showed ectopic deposition of collagen alpha1alpha2alpha1(IV) in GBM humps beneath podocytes. Significant increases in the number of Ki-67-positive mesangial cells were also found, but glomerular WT1 expression was significantly decreased, signifying podocyte death and/or de-differentiation. Indeed, expression profiling of mutant glomeruli suggested a negative regulatory feedback loop involving the HIFalpha prolyl hydroxylase, Egln3. In addition, the brain oxygen-binding protein, Neuroglobin, was induced in mutant podocytes. We conclude that podocyte VHL is required for normal maintenance of podocytes, GBM composition and ultrastructure, and glomerular barrier properties.</text></passage></document><document><id>1513</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Periodic acid-schiff is superior to hematoxylin and eosin for screening prophylactic gastrectomies from CDH1 mutation carriers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>128</offset><text>Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), an autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility syndrome, is largely attributable to germline mutations and deletions in the gene encoding E-cadherin, CDH1. Asymptomatic, mutation-positive individuals often choose prophylactic gastrectomy for cancer risk reduction. Examination of the entire mucosa of prophylactic gastrectomy specimens is essential and shows occult gastric cancers in most cases. We hypothesized that primary screening entire cases stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) instead of hematoxylin and eosin (H_E) could improve diagnostic accuracy and speed of detecting invasive signet-ring adenocarcinoma. Serial sections from 6 prophylactic gastrectomy specimens with molecularly confirmed CDH1 mutations were stained with PAS and H_E, respectively (108 to 164 blocks per case). PAS-stained and H_E-stained slides were randomized for each case and examined microscopically for the presence of invasive signet-ring cells. The time to examine each slide was recorded. Our results showed that significantly fewer lesions were missed (ie, the lesion was initially identified on only 1 section, but present on both sections) on PAS-stained slides (6 missed lesions) than on H_E-stained slides (23 missed lesions); (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, it took significantly less time to screen a PAS-stained case (3 h 05+/-41 min) than an H_E-stained case (4 h 59+/-1 h 2 min) (P&lt;0.05). Selected lesions were confirmed as epithelial by pan-keratin-positive immunohistochemistry. Thus, doing PAS staining instead of H_E on CDH1 mutation-positive prophylactic gastrectomy specimens may increase the detection rate of adenocarcinoma while reducing screening time.</text></passage></document><document><id>1514</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Detection of Fabry's disease heterozygotes by hair root analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>The alpha-galactosidase/beta-hexosaminidase ratio was measured for individual hair roots as a method for heterozygote detection in Fabry's disease.

In vitro studies of the causative organism, Chlamydia trachomatis, demonstrate that iron availability regulates its growth, suggesting that host genes involved in regulating iron status and/or availability may modulate the risk of trachoma. The objective was to investigate whether haptoglobin (Hp) haplotypes constructed from the functional polymorphism (Hp1/Hp2) plus the functional promoter SNPs -61A-C (rs5471) and -101C-G (rs5470), or sickle cell trait (HbAS, rs334) were associated with risk of active trachoma when stratified by age and sex, in rural Gambian children. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In two cross sectional surveys of children aged 6-78 months (n = 836), the prevalence of the clinical signs of active trachoma was 21.4%. Within boys, haplotype E (-101G, -61A, Hp1), containing the variant allele of the -101C-G promoter SNP, was associated with a two-fold increased risk of active trachoma (OR = 2.0 [1.17-3.44]). Within girls, an opposite association was non-significant (OR = 0.58 [0.32-1.04]; P = 0.07) and the interaction by sex was statistically significant (P = 0.001). There was no association between trachoma and HbAS. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that genetic variation in Hp may affect susceptibility to active trachoma differentially by sex in The Gambia.</text></passage></document><document><id>1517</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Functional dominant-negative mutation of sodium channel subunit gene SCN3B associated with atrial fibrillation in a Chinese GeneID population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>143</offset><text>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the clinic, and accounts for more than 15% of strokes. Mutations in cardiac sodium channel alpha, beta1 and beta2 subunit genes (SCN5A, SCN1B, and SCN2B) have been identified in AF patients. We hypothesize that mutations in the sodium channel beta3 subunit gene SCN3B are also associated with AF. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a large scale sequencing analysis of all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of SCN3B in 477 AF patients (28.5% lone AF) from the GeneID Chinese Han population. A novel A130V mutation was identified in a 46-year-old patient with lone AF, and the mutation was absent in 500 controls. Mutation A130V dramatically decreased the cardiac sodium current density when expressed in HEK293/Na(v)1.5 stable cell line, but did not have significant effect on kinetics of activation, inactivation, and channel recovery from inactivation. When co-expressed with wild type SCN3B, the A130V mutant SCN3B negated the function of wild type SCN3B, suggesting that A130V acts by a dominant negative mechanism. Western blot analysis with biotinylated plasma membrane protein extracts revealed that A130V did not affect cell surface expression of Na(v)1.5 or SCN3B, suggesting that mutant A130V SCN3B may not inhibit sodium channel trafficking, instead may affect conduction of sodium ions due to its malfunction as an integral component of the channel complex. This study identifies the first AF-associated mutation in SCN3B, and suggests that mutations in SCN3B may be a new pathogenic cause of AF.</text></passage></document><document><id>1518</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>RUNX2 analysis of Danish cleidocranial dysplasia families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>59</offset><text>Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by mutations in the Runt gene RUNX2.

A platform technique for selective enrichment of functional genomic regions will enable several next-generation sequencing applications that include the discovery of causal mutations for disease and drug response. Here, we describe a powerful platform technique, termed "functional genomic fingerprinting" (FGF), for the multiplexed genomewide isolation and analysis of targeted regions such as the exome, promoterome, or exon splice enhancers. The technique employs a fixed part of a uniquely designed Fixed-Randomized primer, while the randomized part contains all the possible sequence permutations. The Fixed-Randomized primers bind with full sequence complementarity at multiple sites where the fixed sequence (such as the splice signals) occurs within the genome, and multiplex amplify many regions bounded by the fixed sequences (e.g., exons). Notably, validation of this technique using cardiac myosin binding protein-C (MYBPC3) gene as an example strongly supports the application and efficacy of this method.

We recently ascertained a family in which multiple cases of Hodgkin lymphoma had occurred among individuals who inherited a balanced chromosomal translocation. We cloned the translocation breakpoints and found that it disrupted a previously uncharacterized gene, KLHDC8B, encoding a Kelch family protein whose deficiency impairs cytokinesis and leads to binucleated cells. In other families we found a rare single nucleotide polymorphism affecting mitotic translation of KLHDC8B that was associated with and linked to Hodgkin lymphoma. Interestingly, the index family demonstrated an unusual frequency of twins, and there is a previously reported association between Hodgkin lymphoma and twins. Here we review the unusual genetic features of Hodgkin lymphoma, including gender concordance among siblings, and genetically test the hypothesis that KLHDC8B may participate in twinning by disrupting cytokinesis through impediment of polar body separation from oocytes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1524</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genome-wide identification of new imprinted genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>51</offset><text>In the mid-1980s, elegant studies on mouse embryos revealed that both parental genomes are required for normal development leading to the discovery of genomic imprinting. Imprinting is a parent-of-origin-dependent epigenetic mechanism whereby a subset of autosomal genes is expressed from only one of the parental alleles. Imprinting control involves both DNA- and histone-methylation, which differentially mark the parental alleles. More than a hundred imprinted genes have been identified so far, many of which play important roles in the regulation of growth and development. Nonetheless, the full extent of imprinting and its biological functions remain underestimated. In this review, we describe recently developed strategies to identify novel imprinted genes and highlight the potential of combining several high throughput approaches. By integrating databases obtained from epigenome- and transcriptome-wide analyses, we now have the unique opportunity to identify all the imprinted genes in the human/mouse genomes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1525</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Comparative analysis of von Willebrand factor profiles in pulsatile and continuous left ventricular assist device recipients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>A higher rate of nonsurgical bleeding has been observed in nonpulsatile left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients. von Willebrand factor (vWF) profiles were compared for nonpulsatile and pulsatile LVAD recipients to explore mechanisms that may contribute to the development of postimplant nonsurgical bleeding. The nonpulsatile mechanism may impair vWF function by creating a deficiency in vWF high molecular weight multimers (HMWMs), essential for hemostasis. High molecular weight multimer deficiency should result in low ristocetin cofactor (RCo) to vWF antigen ratios (vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag) because of impaired platelet (plt)-binding ability. von Willebrand factor profiles and HMWM were measured pre- and post-LVAD placement in 11 nonpulsatile (HeartMate II [HM II[) and 3 pulsatile (HeartMate XVE [HM XVE]) recipients. All the nonpulsatile LVAD recipients exhibited loss of HMWM 30 days postimplant. The vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower after LVAD placement in the nonpulsatile group when compared with the pulsatile group. In addition, the vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag ratio decreased significantly from baseline 30 days postimplant within the nonpulsatile recipients. All nonpulsatile LVAD recipients had low vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag ratios 30 days post-LVAD even if the values were normal at baseline. These data suggest that nonpulsatile HM II recipients develop HMWM loss and impaired vWF platelet (plt)-binding ability after LVAD placement. Similar results were not observed in our small series of pulsatile HM XVE recipients. This finding could suggest a contributing factor to the increase in nonsurgical bleeding observed in nonpulsatile LVAD patients. Further investigation is ongoing to identify specific causes of vWF impairment.</text></passage></document><document><id>1526</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Deep intronic APC mutations explain a substantial proportion of patients with familial or early-onset adenomatous polyposis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>To uncover pathogenic deep intronic variants in patients with colorectal adenomatous polyposis, in whom no germline mutation in the APC or MUTYH genes can be identified by routine diagnostics, we performed a systematic APC messenger RNA analysis in 125 unrelated mutation-negative cases. Overall, we identified aberrant transcripts in 8% of the patients (familial cases 30%; early-onset manifestation 21%). In eight of them, two different out-of-frame pseudoexons were found consisting of a 167-bp insertion from intron 4 in five families with a shared founder haplotype and a 83-bp insertion from intron 10 in three patients. The pseudoexon formation was caused by three different heterozygous germline mutations, which are supposed to activate cryptic splice sites. In conclusion, a few deep intronic mutations contribute substantially to the APC mutation spectrum. Complementary DNA analysis and/or target sequencing of intronic regions should be considered as an additional mutation discovery approach in polyposis patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1527</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Retraction for Chen et al., Complete and persistent phenotypic correction of phenylketonuria in mice by site-specific genome integration of murine phenylalanine hydroxylase cDNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>179</offset></passage></document><document><id>1528</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations, clinical findings and survival estimates in South American patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>In this study, we analyzed the ABCD1 gene in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) patients and relatives from 38 unrelated families from South America, as well as phenotypic proportions, survival estimates, and the potential effect of geographical origin in clinical characteristics. METHODS: X- ALD patients from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay were invited to participate in molecular studies to determine their genetic status, characterize the mutations and improve the genetic counseling of their families. All samples were screened by SSCP analysis of PCR fragments, followed by automated DNA sequencing to establish the specific mutation in each family. Age at onset and at death, male phenotypes, genetic status of women, and the effect of family and of latitude of origin were also studied. RESULTS: We identified thirty-six different mutations (twelve novel). This population had an important allelic heterogeneity, as only p.Arg518Gln was repeatedly found (three families). Four cases carried de novo mutations. Intra-familiar phenotype variability was observed in all families. Out of 87 affected males identified, 65% had the cerebral phenotype (CALD). The mean (95% CI) ages at onset and at death of the CALD were 10.9 (9.1-12.7) and 24.7 (19.8-29.6) years. No association was found between phenotypic manifestations and latitude of origin. One index-case was a girl with CALD who carried an ABCD1 mutation, and had completely skewed X inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the spectrum of mutations in X-ALD, confirms the high rates of de novo mutations and the absence of common mutations, and suggests a possible high frequency of cerebral forms in our population.</text></passage></document><document><id>1529</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mechanisms Underlying Progressive Polyuria in Familial Neurohypophysial Diabetes Insipidus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>ABSTRACT Familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus (FNDI), an autosomal dominant disorder, is mostly caused by mutations in the gene of neurophysin II (NPII), the carrier protein of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The analyses of knock-in mice expressing a mutant NPII that causes FNDI in humans demonstrated that polyuria progressed substantially in the absence of loss of AVP neurons. Morphological analyses revealed that inclusion bodies were present in the AVP neurons in the supraoptic nucleus and that the size and numbers of inclusion bodies gradually increased in parallel with the increases in urine volume. Electron microscopic analyses showed that aggregates existed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of AVP neurons. These data suggest that cell death is not the primary cause of polyuria in FNDI, and that the aggregate formation in the ER is likely to be related to the pathogenesis of the progressive polyuria.</text></passage></document><document><id>1530</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular bases of C7 deficiency: three different defects. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>59</offset><text>The molecular basis of C7 deficiency has been investigated in two Irish families and a number of Israeli families of Moroccan Sephardic Jewish origin .

Forty-one cases have been reported in which PDD patients subsequently developed TS. We term this PDD----TS. We describe an additional 16 such patients plus 3 families where a close relative of a TS proband had autism. There was a high frequency of alcoholism, drug abuse, obsessive-compulsive, and other behavior disorders in the relatives of these patients. This frequency was virtually identical to that observed in relatives of individuals with TS only. We suggest there is an intimate genetic, neuropathologic relatedness between some cases of PDD and TS. Many observations have led us to suggest that the genetic defect in TS may be a mutation of tryptophan oxygenase and that TS is inherited as a semidominant semirecessive trait, i.e., homozygosity for a common gene which shows some expression in the heterozygous state. We propose that some types of PDD are inherited in the same fashion and by the same gene. This would explain the similarity of symptoms, frequent evolution of PDD into TS, the apparent recessive inheritance of PDD despite no increase in consanguinity, the high frequency of behavior problems in the relatives of PDD----TS patients and the serotonin abnormalities.</text></passage></document><document><id>1535</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel CDKN2A mutation detected in Spanish melanoma pedigree.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset><text>We have examined alterations in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), major melanoma predisposing genes, in a Spanish melanoma-prone population comprising 61 patients from 45 families.

Multiple factors have hampered the effective control of this disease, some of which include the complex biology of the Plasmodium parasites, their high polymorphism and their increasingly high resistance to antimalarial drugs, mainly in endemic regions. The ancient interaction between malarial parasites and humans has led to the fixation in the population of several inherited alterations conferring protection against malaria. Some of the mechanisms underlying protection against this disease are described in this review for hemoglobin-inherited disorders (thalassemia, sickle-cell trait, HbC and HbE), erythrocyte polymorphisms (ovalocytosis and Duffy blood group), enzymopathies (G6PD deficiency and PK deficiency) and immunogenetic variants (HLA alleles, complement receptor 1, NOS2, tumor necrosis factor-a promoter and chromosome 5q31-q33 polymorphisms).</text></passage></document><document><id>1537</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Galactose utilization in Lactobacillus helveticus: isolation and characterization of the galactokinase (galK) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galT) genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>169</offset><text>By complementing appropriate gal lesions in Escherichia coli K802, we were able to isolate the galactokinase (galK) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galT) genes of Lactobacillus helveticus. Tn10 transposon mutagenesis, together with in vivo complementation analysis and in vitro enzyme activity measurements, allowed us to map these two genes. The DNA sequences of the genes and the flanking regions were determined. These revealed that the two genes are organized in the order galK-galT in an operonlike structure. In an in vitro transcription-translation assay, the galK and galT gene products were identified as 44- and 53-kDa proteins, respectively, data which corresponded well with the DNA sequencing data. The deduced amino acid sequence of the galK gene product showed significant homologies to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactokinase sequences, whereas galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase did not show any sequence similarities to other known proteins. This observation, together with a comparison of known gal operon structures, suggested that the L. helveticus operon developed independently to a translational expression unit having a different gene order than that in E. coli, Streptococcus lividans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequencing of the flanking regions revealed an open reading frame downstream of the galKT operon. It was tentatively identified as galM (mutarotase) on the basis of the significant amino acid sequence homology with the corresponding Streptococcus thermophilus gene.</text></passage></document><document><id>1538</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prevalence of the variant allele rs61764370 T>G in the 3'UTR of KRAS among Dutch BRCA1, BRCA2 and non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancer families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>138</offset><text>Recently, a variant allele in the 3'UTR of the KRAS gene (rs61764370 T>G) was shown to be associated with an increased risk for developing non-small cell lung cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, and was most enriched in ovarian cancer patients from hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families. This functional variant has been shown to disrupt a let-7 miRNA binding site leading to increased expression of KRAS in vitro. In the current study, we have genotyped this KRAS-variant in breast cancer index cases from 268 BRCA1 families, 89 BRCA2 families, 685 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families, and 797 geographically matched controls. The allele frequency of the KRAS-variant was found to be increased among patients with breast cancer from BRCA1, but not BRCA2 or non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families as compared to controls. As BRCA1 carriers mostly develop ER-negative breast cancers, we also examined the variant allele frequency among indexes from non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families with ER-negative breast cancer. The prevalence of the KRAS-variant was, however, not significantly increased as compared to controls, suggesting that the variant allele not just simply associates with ER-negative breast cancer. Subsequent expansion of the number of BRCA1 carriers with breast cancer by including other family members in addition to the index cases resulted in loss of significance for the association between the variant allele and mutant BRCA1 breast cancer. In this same cohort, the KRAS-variant did not appear to modify breast cancer risk for BRCA1 carriers. Importantly, results from the current study suggest that KRAS-variant frequencies might be increased among BRCA1 carriers, but solid proof requires confirmation in a larger cohort of BRCA1 carriers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1539</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Retinoblastoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>16</offset><text>Retinoblastoma (Rb) is a malignant tumor that originates from developing retina. Diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms and is usually made in children under the age of five years. Mutations in both alleles of the RB1 gene are a prerequisite for this tumor to develop. In most patients with sporadic unilateral Rb, both RB1 gene mutations occur in somatic cells and are not passed over to offspring (nonhereditary Rb). Almost all patients with sporadic bilateral and virtually all patients with familial Rb are heterozygous for RB1 gene mutations that cause predisposition to Rb (hereditary Rb). In families, Rb predisposition is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait (familial Rb). In addition to Rb, patients with hereditary disease also have an increased risk of tumors outside the eye (second cancer). This risk is enhanced in patients who have received external beam radiotherapy. Analysis of genotype-phenotype associations has shown that the mean number of tumor foci that develop in carriers of mutant RB1 alleles is variable depending on which functions of the normal allele are retained and to what extent. Moreover, phenotypic expression of hereditary retinoblastoma is subject to genetic modification. Identification of the genetic factors that underlie these effects will not only help to arrive at a more precise prognosis but may also point to mechanisms that can be used to reduce the risk of tumor development.</text></passage></document><document><id>1540</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Bipolar pedigrees.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>19</offset></passage></document><document><id>1541</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 2005.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>25</offset><text>Extract: In 1994, Mark Skolnick and his colleagues at Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City announced that they had identified the BRCA1 (BReast CAncer 1) gene. This effectively put an end to a five-year competition that had been raging among several research groups in North America and Europe -- ultimately it was a private company, and not a university-based research group that prevailed. Only a year later a second breast cancer gene, BRCA2 was identified by competing researchers in England. These discoveries are among the most significant in the field of cancer since 1995 in terms of public interest or scientific impact. By 1991 it was known that a gene like BRCA1 conferred a greatly increased risk of breast cancer among women who were born with a mutation of it -- raising the risk from about 8% in their lifetime to 80% or more. The identification of the gene in 1994 permitted the identification of the actual women who were at high risk. Genetic testing for cancer susceptibility soon followed.</text></passage></document><document><id>1542</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Tissue- and age-specific DNA replication patterns at the CTG/CAG-expanded human myotonic dystrophy type 1 locus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy, caused by DM1 CTG/CAG repeat expansions, shows varying instability levels between tissues and across ages within patients.

In patient cells, the repeat is flanked by two replication origins demarcated by CTCF sites, with replication diminished at the expansion. In mice, the expansion replicated from only the downstream origin (CAG as lagging template). In testes from mice of three different ages, replication toward the repeat paused at the earliest age and was relieved at later ages-coinciding with increased instability. Brain, pancreas and thymus replication varied with CpG methylation at DM1 CTCF sites. CTCF sites between progressing forks and repeats reduced replication depending on chromatin.

The estimated molecular mass of 126 kDa predicted the approximate location of the mutation in the mRNA and in the gene. Sequencing of cloned PCR products from patient muscle cDNA revealed a nonsense mutation, which was confirmed by direct sequencing of amplified patient genomic DNA. The mutation, a G to T transversion, at position 3714 changes a glutamic acid codon to an Amber stop codon. Translation of mRNA containing this mutation would be expected to result in a truncated protein with a molecular mass of 133 kDa, in close agreement with the 126 kDa estimated by Western blot analysis.

Normal colorectal tissues were almost negative for Prxs, except Prx4 (15/32). In colorectal cancer tissues, the most prominent reactivity was observed with Prx2 in 23/32 cases, while the corresponding figures for others was 21/32 (Prx1), 18/32 (Prx3, Prx5, Prx6) and 8/32 (Prx4). Prx1 (P=0.023), Prx2 (P=0.012), and Prx5 (P=0.028) were the isoforms that showed significantly increased expression in colorectal cancer patients with stage III or lymphnodes metastasis-positive cases. There was a significant relationship between the expression of Prx1 and Prx2 (rs=0.425, P=0.015) and between Prx3 and Prx4 (rs=0.364, P=0.041). Additionally, 8 cases were studied by western analysis. Prx1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 were particularly elevated in tumors compared to nonmalignant tissue as assessed by immunohistochemistry. It appeared that some Prxs were upexpression in colorectal cancer tissues and may have some prognostic significance; the induction of Prxs could be explained by increased production of reactive oxygen species in carcinomatous tissue.</text></passage></document><document><id>1545</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Down-regulation of transmembrane carbonic anhydrases in renal cell carcinoma cell lines by wild-type von Hippel-Lindau transgenes. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>To discover genes involved in von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) -mediated carcinogenesis , we used renal cell carcinoma cell lines stably transfected with wild-type VHL-expressing transgenes .

Altered expression of genes regulated posttranscriptionally by CUG-BP therefore may contribute to DM pathogenesis . . </text></passage></document><document><id>1548</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>F.

ABCD1gene is the disease gene and more than 500 unique mutations in the ABCD1gene have been recorded in the database, approximately 60% of which are noncurrent ones. Although great progress has been made in the treatment of X-ALD, prenatal diagnosis is still badly needed by X-ALD-stricken families. METHODS: Twelve high-risk fetuses entered this study. Amniotic fluid (AF) was divided into two parts, with one part being used directly to isolate genomic DNA and debris from the other part for amniotic fluid cells (AFC) culturing. STR profiling was performed to evaluate maternal contamination of AFC genomic DNA. Two different molecular approaches, be they any two of direct sequencing, PCR-RFLP, ARMS, dot hybridization and DHPLC, were applied to determine whether the mutation identified in the index patient was found in the fetus. RESULTS: The genotypes of all 12 fetuses were determined, among which 2 were diagnosed as ALD males, 5 unaffected males, 1 heterozygote, and 4 normal unaffected females. A total of 9 families sent samples of umbilical blood at the time of delivery, and results of molecular checking of these samples agreed with those of prenatal diagnosis. Up until now, no ALD-related abnormalities were reported postnatally. CONCLUSION: An in-house protocol for the prenatal molecular diagnosis of X-ALD was established, and this protocol would provide accurate and rapid prenatal genetic service to X-ALD-stricken families.</text></passage></document><document><id>1550</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of the frequency of GNAS codon 201 mutations in advanced colorectal cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>85</offset></passage></document><document><id>1551</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Maternal parenting stress in families with a child with Angelman syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Parenting stress was investigated in mothers with a child with Angelman syndrome (AS) or Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which are genetically related. METHOD: Mothers of 24 children with AS and 23 children with PWS (2-12 years) completed the Nijmegen Parenting Stress Index-Short, Developmental Behaviour Checklist, and Vineland Screener 0-12. RESULTS: Parenting stress was high for 58% of AS and 26% of PWS cases. For both syndromes, no relationship existed with the child's gender, age, or behavioural problems. In PWS there was no effect on level of functioning. Overall, more mothers with a child with AS perceived high parenting stress. When children showed low levels of behavioural problems this difference was contained. However, when children exhibited severe behavioural problems, parenting stress was the same for both syndromes. CONCLUSION: In AS professional family support is essential, since parenting is stressful for many mothers. In PWS, this is especially the case when behavioural problems are present.</text></passage></document><document><id>1552</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Autosomal dominant occult macular dystrophy with an RP1L1 mutation (R45W).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>PURPOSE: To characterize clinical features in occult macular dystrophy (OMD) patients with the RP1L1 gene mutation (p.R45W), one of two previously described mutations in Japanese OMD patients. METHODS: Mutational screening of the RP1L1 gene was performed via polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing for seven unrelated probands (one autosomal dominant and six sporadic probands) with OMD. A comprehensive ophthalmic examination was performed, including Cirrus optical coherence tomography. Full-field electroretinography (ERG), multifocal ERG, and focal macular ERG were performed. RESULTS: The heterozygous mutation (p.R45W) was found in only one female proband with autosomal dominant OMD, whose mother was also diagnosed with OMD and carried the mutation. Ophthalmoscopy showed bilateral normal fundi in the proband but subtle retinal pigment epithelium mottling in the mother. Both the proband and her mother had typical OMD findings: decreased visual acuity and markedly reduced central responses in the multifocal ERG and focal macular ERG. Although full-field ERG revealed normal rod and standard combined responses, photopic and 30-Hz flicker responses were slightly reduced in both the proband and her mother. Optical coherence tomography revealed that the external limiting membrane and inner segment-outer segment boundary were disorganized despite normal macular thickness in the proband, whereas the mother exhibited macular thinning with discontinuous reflectivity of the external limiting membrane and inner segment-outer segment boundary. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical phenotypes differed between the proband and her mother and were indistinguishable from other sporadic or RP1L1-unassociated OMD patients, suggesting that mutation-dependent clinical features may not be present.</text></passage></document><document><id>1553</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Long-term follow-up of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) associated with aortitis syndrome (AOS)].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>It is known that PG is often associated with AOS.

Experts have suggested that up to two-thirds of AJ homozygotes for the common mutation (N370S) are asymptomatic throughout life and never come to medical attention. However, there are no systematic studies of N370S homozygotes to support this presumption. METHODS: Prenatal carrier screening of 8069 AJ adults for 6 common GD mutations was performed. Gaucher disease manifestations in 37 previously unrecognized homozygotes were assessed by clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies. RESULTS: Among the 8069 AJ screenees, 524 GD carriers (1:15) and 9 previously unrecognized GD homozygotes (1:897) were identified, consistent with the rate expected (1:949; P  >  .99). Six of these homozygotes and 31 AJ GD homozygotes identified by other prenatal carrier screening programs in the New York City metropolitan area were evaluated (age range of the homozygotes, 17-40 years). Of these, 84% were N370S homozygotes, others being heteroallelic for N370S and V394L, L444P, or R496H mutations. Notably, 65% reported no GD medical complaints. However, 49% had anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Among the 29 who had imaging studies, 97% had mild to moderate splenomegaly and 55% had hepatomegaly; skeletal imaging revealed marrow infiltration (100%), Erlenmeyer flask deformities (43%), lucencies (22%), and bone infarcts (14%). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry studies of 25 homozygotes found 60% with osteopenia or osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous discussions, almost all asymptomatic GD homozygotes serendipitously diagnosed by prenatal carrier screening had disease manifestations and should be followed for disease progression and institution of appropriate medical treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>1555</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene is required for cell cycle exit upon serum withdrawal. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>The inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) tumor suppressor gene predisposes affected individuals to the human VHL cancer syndrome and is associated with sporadic renal cell carcinomas ( RCC ) and brain hemangioblastomas .

Remarkably , this occurs without affecting the growth rate and cell cycle profile of these cells in culture . The 786-0 cell line , like many cancer cells , fails to exit the cell cycle upon serum withdrawal .

Another common feature of solid tumors is the presence of hypoxia as indicated by the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) such as HIF-1a. Here, we demonstrate a novel link between APC and hypoxia and show that APC and HIF-1a antagonize each other. Hypoxia results in reduced levels of APC mRNA and protein via a HIF-1a-dependent mechanism. HIF-1a represses the APC gene via a functional hypoxia-responsive element on the APC promoter. In contrast, APC-mediated repression of HIF-1a requires wild-type APC, low levels of b-catenin, and nuclear factor-kB activity. These results reveal down-regulation of APC as a new mechanism that contributes to the survival advantage induced by hypoxia and also show that loss of APC mutations produces a survival advantage by mimicking hypoxic conditions.</text></passage></document><document><id>1557</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The rate of the predominant Jewish mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, MSH2 and MSH6 genes in unselected Jewish endometrial cancer patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: The genes associated with familial Endometrial Cancer (EC) are largely unknown. While EC is an integral part of Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer, there is an ongoing debate if EC is indeed overrepresented in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer families. METHODS: Unselected Jewish women with EC who were diagnosed from January 1982 to January 2008 were genotyped for the predominant mutations in Jewish individuals in BRCA1 (185delAG, 5382InsC, Tyr978X) BRCA2 (6174delT), MSH2 (A636P, 324delCA) and MSH6 (c.3984_3987dup). RESULTS: Overall, 289 Jewish women with EC were included, the majority (217-75%) were Ashkenazim. Mean age at diagnosis was 62.6    12 years, the most common histopathology was type I (endometrioid carcinoma) (80.4% of participants) with 29 having type II (Uterine papillary serous and clear cell cancer) Most patients (85.4%) had stage 1 disease by the FIGO staging. Five women (1.7%-2.3% of the Ashkenazim) carried either the BRCA1*185delAG (n = 4) or BRCA2*6174delT (n = 1) mutations, a rate similar with that of the general Ashkenazi population. Notably, none of 34 women with type II EC carried any BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Four (1.8%) and three (1.4%) of the 217 Ashkenazim patients harbored the c.3984_3987dup, A636P, MSH6 and MSH2 mutations, respectively, and 1/72 (1.4%) of the non-Ashkenazi patients harbored the 324delCA MSH2 mutation. Three of 42 (7.1%) women with EC diagnosed &lt; 50 years carried either BRCA1 MSH6 or MSH2 mutations.

Pig-a is the only gene involved in GPI anchor synthesis that is on the X-chromosome, and research into the origins of an acquired genetic disease involving GPI anchor deficiency (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) indicates that cells lacking GPI anchors, or GPI-anchored cell surface proteins, almost always have mutations in the Pig-a gene. These properties of the Pig-a gene and the GPI anchor system have been exploited in a series of assays for measuring in vivo gene mutation in blood cells from humans, rats, mice, and monkeys. In rats, flow cytometric measurement of Pig-a mutation in red blood cells requires microliter volumes of blood and data can be generated in hours. Spontaneous mutant frequencies are relatively low (&lt;5   10(-6)) and rats treated with multiple doses of the potent mutagen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, display Pig-a mutant frequencies that are close to the sum of the frequencies produced by the individual exposures. A general observation is that induced mutant frequencies are manifested earlier in reticulocytes (about 2 weeks after treatment) than in total red blood cells (about 2 months after exposure). Based on data from a limited number of test agents, the assay shows promise for regulatory applications, including integration of gene mutation measurement into repeat-dose toxicology studies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1559</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nonspecific lipid transfer protein (sterol carrier protein-2) defective in patients with deficient peroxisomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>The biosynthesis and intracellular localization of nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) in control human subjects and in patients with peroxisome-deficient disorders were investigated. The molecular mass of human nsLTP was indistinguishable from that of rat nsLTP (13 kDa) by immunoblot analysis. Intracellular localization was identical with that of catalase, a marker enzyme of peroxisomal matrix, by a double immunofluorescence study. The nsLTP was deficient in liver tissues or fibroblasts from patients with peroxisome-deficient disorders such as Zellweger syndrome and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Pulse-chase experiments showed that nsLTP was synthesized as a large precursor in both the control and Zellweger fibroblasts. However, the processing to the 13 kDa mature protein was disturbed and the degradation was rapid in Zellweger fibroblasts. After somatic cell fusion using Zellweger fibroblasts from different genetic groups, the processing was normalized. These results suggest that the biosynthesis and localization of human nsLTP are similar to those of rat nsLTP and that the defect of nsLTP in peroxisome-deficient disorders is a phenomenon secondary to an abnormal transport mechanism of peroxisomal proteins. The defect of nsLTP may play an important role in metabolic disturbances in bile acid synthesis and steroidogenesis in peroxisome-deficient disorders.</text></passage></document><document><id>1560</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Brick1 is an essential regulator of actin cytoskeleton required for embryonic development and cell transformation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>Brick1 (Brk1) is the less-studied component of the Wave/Scar pathway involved in the branched nucleation of actin fibers. The clinical relevance of Brk1 is emphasized by correlative data showing that Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) patients that also lose the BRK1 gene are protected against the development of tumors. This contrasts with recent evidence suggesting that the Wave complex may function as an invasion suppressor in epithelial cancers. Here, we show that the downregulation of Brk1 results in abnormal actin stress fiber formation and vinculin distribution and loss of Arp2/3 and Wave proteins at the cellular protrusions. Brk1 is required for cell proliferation and cell transformation by oncogenes. In addition, Brk1 downregulation results in defective directional migration and invasive growth in renal cell carcinoma cells as well as in other tumor cell types. Finally, genetic ablation of Brk1 results in dramatic defects in embryo compaction and development, suggesting an essential role for this protein in actin dynamics. Thus, genetic loss or inhibition of BRK1 is likely to be protective against tumor development due to proliferation and motility defects in affected cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>1561</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Pattern dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>The authors describe a family in which one member had pattern dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium.

Long-term Phe tolerance as measured by the distribution of plasma Phe levels in categories (0-3.9, 4.0-9.9, 10-15.9 and over 16 mg/dl) was much improved in patients with RAs greater than 0.8%. There was a negative correlation between RA and number of plasma Phe levels greater than 16 mg/dl. Relationship between full scale IQ at the age of 9 years and dietary control showed a positive correlation between IQ and the number of Phe levels between 0-10 mg/dl (k = .50 p less than 0.05). Highest (negative) correlation (k = -0.67 p less than 0.007) was found between full scale IQ and the number of Phe values greater than 16 mg/dl as measured over 9 years. On the one hand detectable RA of PAH reduces the risk of high Phe levels and thus may also reduce the risk of brain damage in untreated or suboptimally treated patients with PAH. On the other hand enzyme measurement of PAH is no predictive parameter for Phe tolerance in an individual patient since RA may be very similar in phenylketonuric/hyperphenylalaninaemic patients. For practical purposes the oral protein loading test at the age of 6 months will give the most reliable results for differential diagnosis of PAH deficiency.</text></passage></document><document><id>1563</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Germline mutations in CDH1 are infrequent in women with early-onset or familial lobular breast cancers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in CDH1 are associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer; lobular breast cancer also occurs excessively in families with such condition. METHOD: To determine if CDH1 is a susceptibility gene for lobular breast cancer in women without a family history of diffuse gastric cancer, germline DNA was analysed for the presence of CDH1 mutations in 318 women with lobular breast cancer who were diagnosed before the age of 45 years or had a family history of breast cancer and were not known, or known not, to be carriers of germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Cases were ascertained through breast cancer registries and high-risk cancer genetic clinics (Breast Cancer Family Registry, the kConFab and a consortium of breast cancer genetics clinics in the United States and Spain). Additionally, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification was performed for 134 cases to detect large deletions. RESULTS: No truncating mutations and no large deletions were detected. Six non-synonymous variants were found in seven families. Four (4/318 or 1.3%) are considered to be potentially pathogenic through in vitro and in silico analysis.

A molecular diagnosis was performed on 135 patients with Wilson disease in Taiwan. We identified 36 different mutations, eight of which were novel: five missense mutations (Ser986Phe, Ile1348Asn, Gly1355Asp, Met1392Lys, and Ala1445Pro), one deletion (2810delT) in the coding region, and two nucleotide substitutions (-133A > C and -215A > T) in the promoter region. These mutations were not observed in 100 control subjects and reduced the activity of the mutated protein by at least 50% when compared with wild-type ATP7B. In addition to exon 8, our data indicate another mutation hotspot in exon 12 where 9.62% of all mutations occurred. An alternative splice variant of ATP7B lacking exon 12 was observed in one patient who had a homozygous 2810delT mutation and very mild clinical symptoms. Clinical examination and functional characterization of alternative splice variants of ATP7B lacking exon 12 showed that they retained 80% of their biological activity. The 2810delT mutation increased the expression of these variants, which may have explained the mild symptoms in the patient with the 2810delT mutation. We also discovered that treating liver cancer cells with a Na(+)/H(+) exchanger inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride, significantly enhanced the expression of the alternative splice variant of ATP7B lacking exon 12.

The less severe degrees of enzyme deficiency (sex-linked recessive gout and/or urolithiasis or the 'partial HPRT-deficiency' syndrome) may be associated with minor neurological manifestations. Whole body purine synthesis de novo is accelerated in both these groups of patients. A strain of mice with an experimentally produced mutation at the HPRT locus showed some residual 'apparent HPRT activity' in brain, liver, testicular, splenic, kidney and ovarian tissues but not in erythrocyte haemolysates. The mutation removes exons 1 and 2 of the coding region of the gene together with the promotor and about 10 kb of upstream sequence from the gene. It is therefore possible that the observed 'apparent HPRT activity' in these mice is due to the operation of an alternative metabolic pathway. Purine synthesis de novo was markedly accelerated in their brain, testicular, splenic and kidney tissues. It was not accelerated in the liver tissue of male mice hemizygous for the mutation and the degree of acceleration in the female homozygotes only just reached statistical significance at the p = 0.02 level. This observation casts doubt on the importance of modulations in the rate of hepatic purine synthesis de novo as a mechanism for maintaining a steady supply of purines for translocation to other organs.</text></passage></document><document><id>1569</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel PAX6 deletion in a Chinese family with congenital aniridia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>PURPOSE: To identify a disease-causing paired box 6 (PAX6) gene mutation in a Chinese family affected by autosomal dominant congenital aniridia. METHODS: All participants in the study, including the aniridia family and 100 unrelated senile cataract controls, received a comprehensive ophthalmic examination. Genomic DNA was extracted from their whole blood. Mutation screen in all exons and their adjacent splicing junctions of PAX6 was performed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. PCR products of heterozygous mutation were further cloned into T-vectors and confirmed by sequencing. Multiple alignments were performed using ClustalX to compare PAX6 protein sequences among vertebrates. MicroRNA binding sites were predicted by TargetScan. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous PAX6 deletion c.1251_1353del103 (p.Pro418Serfs*87) affecting exon 14 and the 3'-untranslated-region (3'-UTR) was identified in the congenital aniridia family. The mutation was exclusively observed in all affected family members but not in any unaffected family member or unrelated control. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the deletion led to remarkable changes of the PAX6 protein, including a frameshift, changes of protein sequence, and a COOH-terminal extension. Multiple alignments showed that the affected region of PAX6 shared high sequence identity (100%) among its vertebrate orthologs. The COOH-terminal extension might also affect microRNA binding sites in the 3'-UTR as predicted by TargetScan. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study we reported a novel PAX6 deletion resulting in an abnormal PAX6 COOH-terminal extension in the Chinese family affected by aniridia. Our findings thus add to the mutation spectrum of PAX6.</text></passage></document><document><id>1570</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[WASP gene mutation analysis of a family of X-linked thrombocytopenia].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the history and gene mutations of a family with X-linked thrombocytopenia, in order to understand the clinical characteristic and molecular pathogenesis of the disease.

BACKGROUND: CTX is a rare inherited disorder characterised by progressive neurological impairment. Appropriate therapy can slow disease progression. Measures of brain volume changes have been used in several neurological disorders due to their value in assessing disease outcome and monitoring patients' evolution. METHODS: 24 CTX patients underwent conventional MRI to measure total and regional brain volumes. In five CTX patients who started therapy at baseline, clinical and MRI examinations were repeated after 2 years. Clinical disability, overall cognitive performance and cerebellar function were evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (RS), Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and cerebellar functional system score (CB-FSS). RESULTS: Measures of normalised brain, cortical and cerebellar volumes were lower in CTX patients than in healthy controls (p&lt;0.01). Instead, there were no differences in normalised white matter volumes between the two groups (p=0.1). At regional analysis, a significant volume decrease was found in each cortical region (p&lt;0.01 for all regions). Normalised cortical volumes correlated closely with age (r=-0.9, p&lt;0.0001), RS (r=-0.65, p&lt;0.001) and MMSE (r=-0.60, p&lt;0.01). Normalised cerebellar volumes correlated closely with CB-FSS scores (r=-0.58, p&lt;0.01). In the five CTX patients followed over time, the annual brain volume decrease was -1.1    0.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical volume, rather than white matter volume, is diffusely decreased in CTX patients and correlates closely with the patient's clinical status. These data provide evidence for the presence of clinically relevant neuronal-axonal damage in the brains of CTX patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1572</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mechanisms for phenotypic variation in Lesch-Nyhan disease and its variants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan disease is a neurogenetic disorder caused by mutation of the HPRT1 gene on the X chromosome. There is significant variation in the clinical phenotype, with more than 300 different known mutations. There are few studies that have addressed whether similar mutations result in similar phenotypes across different patients because hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt) deficiency is rare, and most mutations are unique or limited to individual families. However, recent studies have revealed multiple unrelated patients with similar mutations, providing an opportunity to examine genotype-phenotype correlations. We found significant variation among the clinical features of 10 patients from 8 unrelated families all carrying a mutation replacing guanine with adenine at base position 143 (c.143G>A) in the HPRT1 gene. This mutation results in replacement of arginine by histidine at amino acid position 48 (p.arg48his) in the HGprt enzyme. Biochemically, the enzyme exhibits reduced thermal integrity, a mechanism that may explain clinical variation. The literature reveals similar clinical variation among other patients with similar mutations, although the variation is relatively minor across the whole population of patients. Identifiable sources of clinical variation include known limitations of clinical ascertainment and mechanisms that affect residual enzyme activity and stability. These results are helpful for understanding genotype-phenotype correlations and discordance and likely are applicable to other neurogenetic disorders where similar variation occurs.</text></passage></document><document><id>1573</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and failure to thrive: answer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset></passage></document><document><id>1574</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Tuberous sclerosis: report of a case with fibromatosis of the facial soft tissues.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) is a dominantly inherited disorder which is characterised by a triad of mental deficiency, epilepsy and angiofibromas of the face.

Tandem repeats are a major class of repetitive DNA and the extent of their polymorphic distributions and functions within the human genome are only beginning to be explored. Tandem repeat polymorphisms (TRPs) provide a unique source of genomic variability and recent evidence suggests they can modulate a range of biological processes, in developing and mature organisms. Tandem repeats can change length during meiosis and mitosis, providing a dynamic source of genetic variation which may not only influence evolutionary processes, but also somatic cellular selection. Furthermore, recent evidence for post-mitotic instability of specific tandem repeats in neurons supports their additional possible roles in neuronal function and dysfunction. The mutation rate of TRPs is higher and the extent of polymorphism is far more diverse than that of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Whereas SNPs are invariably binary in nature, TRPs generally exhibit extended digital (multiallelic) distributions, which provide a much richer range of polymorphic variants, and thus a wider possible range of genetic contribution to disease susceptibility. Expansions in tandem repeats are known to cause many monogenic disorders, which mainly affect the nervous system, including Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, other polyglutamine diseases, Friedreich ataxia, fragile X syndrome, myoclonic epilepsy, polyalanine disorders, and myotonic dystrophy. Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that TRPs could help solve the conundrum of "missing heritability" produced by SNP-based genome-wide association studies of various polygenic complex diseases. There are hundreds of thousands of unique tandem repeats in the human genome and their polymorphic distributions have the potential to greatly influence functional diversity and disease susceptibility. Recent discoveries in this expanding field are discussed, with a focus on the role of TRPs in brain development, function, and dysfunction.</text></passage></document><document><id>1577</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The pattern ERG in Best's disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>35</offset><text>The aim of this study was to assess inner retinal function in patients with Best's disease using the pattern ERG (PERG).

A poorly understood clinical manifestation of pathological angiogenesis is angiodysplasia, vascular malformations that cause severe gastrointestinal bleeding. Angiodysplasia can be associated with von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common bleeding disorder in man. VWD is caused by a defect or deficiency in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein essential for normal hemostasis that is involved in inflammation. We hypothesized that VWF regulates angiogenesis. Inhibition of VWF expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in endothelial cells (ECs) caused increased in vitro angiogenesis and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)-dependent proliferation and migration, coupled to decreased integrin avb3 levels and increased angiopoietin (Ang)-2 release. ECs expanded from blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells of VWD patients confirmed these results. Finally, 2 different approaches, in situ and in vivo, showed increased vascularization in VWF-deficient mice. We therefore identify a new function of VWF in ECs, which confirms VWF as a protein with multiple vascular roles and defines a novel link between hemostasis and angiogenesis. These results may have important consequences for the management of VWD, with potential therapeutic implications for vascular diseases.</text></passage></document><document><id>1580</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>cDNA isolation, expression analysis, and chromosomal localization of two human zinc finger genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset><text>On the basis of sequence similarity in the repeated zinc finger domain, we have identified and characterized two human cDNA clones (ZNF7 and ZNF8), both encoding proteins containing potential finger-like nucleic acid binding motifs.

To further explore this, we examined the impact of prognostic factors on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with known BRCA mutation status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed stage III-IV OC patients treated at our institution between 1 December 1996 and 30 September 2006 and also tested on protocol for BRCA mutations. Impact on DFS and OS was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 36 had deleterious BRCA mutations [BRCA (+)] and 74 were BRCA wild type [BRCA(-)]. Thirty-one of 36 (86%) BRCA (+) and 60 of 74 (81%) BRCA (-) patients were platinum sensitive (P   =   0.60). Median OS was longer for BRCA (+) patients (not reached versus 67.8 months; P   =   0.02), but DFS was similar (26.9 versus 24.0, P   =   0.3). On multivariate analysis, OS correlated with primary platinum sensitivity [HR   =   0.15; 95% CI (confidence interval) 0.06-0.34] and BRCA (+) mutation status (HR   =   0.33; 95% CI 0.12-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: BRCA mutation status predicted OS independent of primary platinum sensitivity, suggesting that underlying tumor biology contributes to disease outcome and may be worthy of consideration in future clinical trial design.</text></passage></document><document><id>1582</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial pycnodysostosis: identification of a novel mutation in the CTSK gene (cathepsin K).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Pycnodysostosis, an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia, is characterized by short stature, osteosclerosis, delayed cranial suture closure, hypoplastic mandible, acro-osteolysis, hypoplastic clavicle, and dental anomalies.

It presents cataracts and glaucoma, delay in neuropsychomotor development, cognitive deficits, and renal Fanconi syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Describe five patients with OCRL, attended at Tubulopathy outpatient clinic. METHOD: We performed a retrospective assessment of 5 male patient clinical charts of OCRL patients. RESULTS: Mean age at first consultation was 76.5 and mean follow up interval was 30.5 months (8-53 months). Symptoms and clinical signs included cataracts and nystagmus. Neuropsychomotor development and weight and height deficits were present in whole cases, as well as polyuria, polydipsia, and intestinal constipation, metabolic acidosis, phosphaturia, bicarbonaturia, proteinuria, hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria. Nephrocalcinosis was identified in one, renal lithiasis in three, and reduced kidney size in two patients. We found pathological fractures and rachitism in two, bone rarefaction and delay of bone age in all of the patients. One patient presented a reduction in the rhythm of glomerular filtration. Therapeutically, all patients received alkali, phosphorus and vitamin D reposition in addition to a dietary orientation adequate to their needs. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and medico-nutritional followup, to avoid complications related to metabolic disturbances.</text></passage></document><document><id>1585</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Correction of murine mucopolysaccharidosis VII by a human beta-glucuronidase transgene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>We recently described a murine model for mucopolysaccharidosis VII in mice that have an inherited deficiency of beta-glucuronidase (beta-D-glucuronoside glucuronosohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.31). Affected mice, of genotype gusmps/gusmps, present clinical manifestations similar to those of humans with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly syndrome) and are shown here to have secondary elevations of other lysosomal enzymes. The mucopolysaccharidosis VII phenotype in both species includes dwarfism, skeletal deformities, and premature death. Lysosome storage is visualized within enlarge vesicles and correlates biochemically with accumulation of undegraded and partially degraded glycosaminoglycans. In this report we describe the consequences of introducing the human beta-glucuronidase gene, GUSB, into gusmps/gusmps mice that produce virtually no murine beta-glucuronidase. Transgenic mice homozygous for the mucopolysaccharidosis VII mutation expressed high levels of human beta-glucuronidase activity in all tissues examined and were phenotypically normal. Biochemically, both the intralysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans and the secondary elevation of other acid hydrolases were corrected. These findings demonstrate that the GUSB transgene is expressed in gusmps/gusmps mice and that human beta-glucuronidase corrects the murine mucopolysaccharidosis storage disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1586</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A 16-year-old male with recurrent inflammation and hearing loss.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset></passage></document><document><id>1587</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Adrenoleukodystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>22</offset><text>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that encodes a protein of the peroxisomal membrane named ALDP. Mutations in ALDP result in elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and reduced VLCFA oxidation in peroxisomes. Three main phenotypes are seen in affected males. The childhood cerebral form manifests usually between ages 4 and 8 years. It initially resembles attention deficit disorder or hyperactivity. Progressive central demyelination with impairment of cognition, behavior, vision, hearing, and motor function follow the initial symptoms and often lead to total disability within 2 years. The second phenotype, adrenomyeloneuropathy, manifests most commonly in the late twenties as progressive paraparesis, sphincter disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and often, impaired adrenocortical function; all symptoms are progressive over decades. The third phenotype, 'Addison disease only', presents with primary adrenocortical insufficiency between age 2 years and adulthood and most commonly by age 7.5 years, without evidence of neurologic abnormality. Approximately 50% of females who are carriers develop neurologic manifestations that resemble adrenomyeloneuropathy but have a later onset (age >= 35 years) and a milder disease. In this review, we will give an overview of the present understanding of ALD, and the implications of new diagnostics and treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>1588</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[P 11 deletion syndrome.

Ten-month-old WHHL rabbits were divided into 3 groups, i.e. control rabbits, sacrificed at age 10 months, and placebo and treated rabbits, sacrificed at age 18 months. The treated rabbits were given pravastatin sodium (50 mg/kg/day), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in combination with cholestyramine (2% in diet), a bile acid sequestrant, for 36 weeks. The serum cholesterol levels and atherogenic lipoproteins in the treated group were markedly reduced, by about 60% (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.001). Consequently, the degrees of both coronary and aortic atherosclerosis in the treated group were significantly reduced compared with the placebo group, and were almost the same as in the control group. The histopathological findings supported the above results. In addition, the incidence and degree of xanthomas in digital joints in the treated group were significantly reduced. These results suggest that established atherosclerosis and xanthomas in mature WHHL rabbits could be suppressed by keeping their serum cholesterol levels extremely low by the combination drug treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>1591</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Risk factors for amyloidosis and impact of kidney transplantation on the course of familial Mediterranean fever.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Amyloidosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) may lead to end-stage renal failure, culminating in kidney transplantation in some patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess demographic, clinical and genetic risk factors for the development of FMF amyloidosis in a subset of kidney-transplanted patients and to evaluate the impact of transplantation on the FMF course. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and genetic data were abstracted from the files, interviews and examinations of 16 kidney-transplanted FMF amyloidosis patients and compared with the data of 18 FMF patients without amyloidosis. RESULTS: Age at disease onset and clinical severity of the FMF amyloidosis patients prior to transplantation were similar to FMF patients without amyloidosis. Compliance with colchicine treatment, however, was much lower (50% vs. 98%). Posttransplantation, FMF amyloidosis patients experienced fewer of the typical serosal attacks than did their counterparts (mean 2214 days since last attack vs. 143 days). Patients with FMF amyloidosis carried only M694V mutations in the FMF gene, while FMF without amyloidosis featured other mutations as well. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with treatment and genetic makeup but not severity of FMF constitutes major risk factors for the development of amyloidosis in FMF. Transplantation seems to prevent FMF attacks. The protective role of immunosuppressive therapy cannot be excluded.</text></passage></document><document><id>1592</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: mRNA expression of HPRT in patients with enzyme proven deficiency of HPRT and normal HPRT coding region of the DNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>138</offset><text>Inherited mutation of the purine salvage enzyme, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gives rise to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) or Lesch-Nyhan variants (LNV).

Seventy-four percent of participants had deletions, 14% had either uniparental disomy (UPD) or imprinting defects, and 12% had UBE3A mutations. Participants with UPD/imprinting defects were heavier (P   =   0.0002), while those with deletions were lighter, than the general population (P   &lt;   0.0001). Twenty out of 92 participants were underweight, all of whom had deletions or UBE3A mutations. Eight out of 92 participants (6/13 (46%) with UPD/imprinting defects and 2/11 (18%) with UBE3A mutations) were obese. Seventy-four out of 92 participants (80%) had absolute or relative microcephaly. No participant was macrocephalic. The most common behavioral findings were mouthing behavior (95%), short attention span (92%), ataxic or broad-based gait (88%), history of sleep difficulties (80%), and fascination with water (75%). Frequent, easily provoked laughter was observed in 60%. Clinical seizures were reported in 65% of participants but all electroencephalograms (EEGs) were abnormal. We conclude that the most characteristic feature of AS is the neurobehavioral phenotype, but specific EEG findings are highly sensitive for AS.

A much larger fraction of breast cancer might , in principle , be due to common variants which confer more modest individual risks . There are several common polymorphisms in the BRCA1 gene which generate amino acid substitutions . We have examined the frequency of four of these polymorphisms  Gln356Arg , Pro871Leu , Glu1038Gly and Ser1613Gly in large series of breast and ovarian cancer cases and matched controls .

Thus the most common polymorphisms of the BRCA1 gene do not make a significant contribution to breast or ovarian cancer risk .

We extended our analysis to other non-Ashkenazi subsets  354 of Moroccan origin , 200 Yemenites and 150 Iranian Jews . Heteroduplex analysis complemented by direct DNA sequencing of abnormally migrating bands were employed . Four of Moroccan origin ( 1 . 1 % ) and none of the Yemenites or Iranians was a carrier of the 185delAG mutation .

We conclude that the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation occurs in some non-Ashkenazi populations at rates comparable with that of Ashkenazim . The majority of Jewish 185delAG mutation carriers have a common allelic pattern , supporting the founder effect notion , but dating the mutations origin to an earlier date than currently estimated .

We confirm the Cdc42-APC interaction using pulldown assays in vitro and FRET assays in vivo. Interestingly, Cdc42 interacts with APC at leading edge sites where F-actin is enriched. In contrast, Cdc42 interacts with the truncated mutant APC                in cellular puncta associated with the golgi-lysozome pathway in transfected CHO cells.

Taken together, these data indicate that the Cdc42-APC interaction induces localization of both APC and mutant APC and may thus play a direct role in the functions of these proteins.</text></passage></document><document><id>1606</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The requirement of p53 for maintaining chromosomal stability during tetraploidization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>Tetraploidization is believed to promote genome instability and tumorigenesis. Whether tetraploids per se are intrinsically unstable and transforming remain incompletely understood. In this report, tetraploidization was induced with cell fusion using mouse fibroblasts. Due to the unequal segregation of chromosomes during multipolar mitosis, the majority of cells were eliminated by p53-dependent mechanisms after tetraploidization. The rare tetraploid fibroblasts that were able to undergo bipolar mitosis remained chromosomally stable and nontransformed over many generations. Suppression of p53 functions during tetraploidization, either by RNA interference or by using p53-deficient mouse fibroblasts, produced cells that were chromosomally unstable. They were fast growing and displayed anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. In contrast, impairment of p53 functions after tetraploids were established was ineffective in triggering chromosomal instability and transformation. Collectively, these results are consistent with a model that during early stages of tetraploidization, the lack of p53 promotes the survival of chromosomally unstable sub-tetraploids, leading to transformation. Once tetraploids are established, however, p53 is not essential for maintaining chromosome stability.</text></passage></document><document><id>1607</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Direct analysis for familial adenomatous polyposis mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>62</offset><text>Over the past decade, the genes that underlie the development of many human diseases have been identified and the diseases causing mutations within these genes have been unveiled.

These alterations range from simple Mendelian inherited syndromes to more complex traits such as cancers that involve multiple genetic and environmental factors. Identification and characterization of disease-causing mutations has practical as well as biological implications. As our understanding of these alterations advances, the potential for developing molecular genetic markers with clinical applications increases. This improved understanding also opens new avenues for advances in diagnostic testing, prognostication, and design of preventative strategies or therapeutic interventions.

Nevertheless, no reports are available on the clinical and molecular spectrum of galactosemia from the Indian population. The present study was designed to establish the frequency of these two most common mutations and their variants in Indian galactosemia patients so as to determine a single most common mutation/polymorphism for establishing the DNA-based diagnosis of galactosemia. Three alleles were found to be present at a frequency of 0.036 (Q188R), 0.40 (N314D), and 0.39 (D2); no D1 alleles were found. A significantly higher frequency of the Duarte 2 allele in our population suggests the presence of a milder form of galactosemia, which can be well managed by early diagnosis and dietary management.</text></passage></document><document><id>1610</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The 5' end of the BRCA1 gene lies within a duplicated region of human chromosome 17q21. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>To begin to address the hypothesis that abnormal regulation of the breast / ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is a critical step in sporadic breast / ovarian tumorigenesis , we have determined the detailed structure of the BRCA1 genomic region .

In this study we describe treatment of renal disease in two siblings with FLD. The proband WX at the age of 31  years presented proteinuria and ankle oedema during her third pregnancy. Diagnosis of FLD was based on a renal biopsy with characteristic serpiginous fibrillar deposits under electron microscopy, markedly decreased HDL cholesterol, esterified cholesterol levels and LCAT activity, confirmed by molecular analysis. After 3  years her proteinuria increased and she received an ACE inhibitor to which she responded well. During further increases of proteinuria she additionally received methylprednisolone and her proteinuria decreased. This long-term observation indicates the efficacy of corticosteroids and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in the treatment of proteinuria in patients with FLD. The results suggest the role of inflammatory processes as well as dyslipidemia in the pathogenesis of glomerular disorders in LCAT-deficient patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1613</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An exceptional mutational event leading to Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome in a large consanguineous family.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder featuring congenital ichthyosis combined with pleiomorphic visceral manifestations associated with tissue accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets.

The purposed of this study was to ascertain the genetic defect underlying CDS in a large multigenerational family. We used a combination of direct sequencing, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and microsatellite marker genotyping to identify a novel CDS-causing mutation in ABHD5. Although no pathogenic mutation could be identified in the coding sequence of the ABHD5 gene, polymorphic marker genotyping analysis supported linkage to this gene locus. Accordingly, direct sequencing of RT-PCR amplification products generated from patient skin-derived total RNA, revealed in all four patients the presence of a 101 bp insertion between exon 3 and exon 4. Bioinformatic analysis and direct sequencing indicated that this insertion resulted from an exceptional mutational event, namely, the insertion of a LINE element into intron 3 of the ABHD5 gene, leading to aberrant splicing out of the mutant intron 3. Our results confirm genetic homogeneity in CDS and underscore the importance of RNA studies in the molecular diagnosis of genodermatoses.</text></passage></document><document><id>1614</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Isolation and characterization of beta-actin gene of carp (Cyprinus carpio).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>A beta-actin gene of carp (Cyprinus carpio) was isolated from a genomic EMBL3 library.

The transcriptional start site is 85 bp and 24 bp downstream respectively from consensus CCAAT and TATA promoter elements. The organization of the carp beta-actin gene is identical to that of chicken, human, and rat genes in terms of size, exon/intron locations and junctions and in having a translationally silent first exon. The fish gene is 90% and 99% conserved at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, with land vertebrate beta-actin genes. Northern blot analysis of beta-actin gene expression indicated that the gene is highly expressed in brain, less so in muscle, and much less so in liver cells. The putative beta-actin proximal promoter of carp, identified by the conservation of known actin regulatory sequences, is transcriptionally active in both mammalian and piscine cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>1615</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic determinants of plasma von Willebrand factor antigen levels: a target gene SNP and haplotype analysis of ARIC cohort.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>von Willebrand factor (VWF) is an essential component of hemostasis and has been implicated in thrombosis.

Among the nongenomic factors, age and body mass index contributed 4.8% and 1.6% of VWF variation, respectively. The SNP rs514659 (tags O blood type) contributed 15.4% of the variance. Among the VWF SNPs, we identified 18 SNPs that are associated with levels of VWF. The correlative SNPs are either intronic (89%) or silent exonic (11%). Although SNPs examined are distributed throughout the entire VWF gene without apparent cluster, all the positive SNPs are located in a 50-kb region. Exons in this region encode for VWF D2, D', and D3 domains that are known to regulate VWF multimerization and storage. Mutations in the D3 domain are also associated with von Willebrand disease. Fifteen of these 18 correlative SNPs are in 2 distinct haplotype blocks.

Genetic mutations responsible for type 3 VWD are very heterogeneous, scattered throughout the VWF gene and show high variability among different populations. METHODS: Twenty-five severe VWD patients were studied by direct sequencing of the 51 coding exons of the VWF gene. The total number of VWD type 3 families in Hungary is 24, of which 23 were investigated. RESULTS: Fifteen novel mutations were identified in 31 alleles, five being nonsense mutations (p.Q1238X, p.Q1898X, p.Q1931X, p.S2505X and p.S2568X), four small deletions and insertions resulting in frame shifts (c.1992insC, c.3622delT, c.5315insGA and c.7333delG), one a large partial deletion (delExon1-3) of the 5'-region, four candidate missense mutations (p.C35R, p.R81G, p.C295S, p.C623T) and one a candidate splice site mutation (c.1730-10C>A). Six previously described mutations were detected in 17 alleles, including the repeatedly found c.2435delC, p.R1659X and p.R1853X. Only one patient developed alloantibodies to VWF, carrying a homozygous c.3622delT. CONCLUSION: We report the genetic background of the entire Hungarian type 3 VWD population. A large novel deletion, most probably due to a founder effect, seems to be unique to Hungarian type 3 VWD patients with high allele frequency. In contrast to previous reports, none of the five patients homozygous for the large partial deletion developed inhibitors to VWF. This discrepancy raises the possibility of selection bias in some of the reports.</text></passage></document><document><id>1617</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Liver mitochondrial membrane crosslinking and destruction in a rat model of Wilson disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>Wilson disease (WD) is a rare hereditary condition that is caused by a genetic defect in the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B that results in hepatic copper accumulation and lethal liver failure. The present study focuses on the structural mitochondrial alterations that precede clinical symptoms in the livers of rats lacking Atp7b, an animal model for WD. Liver mitochondria from these Atp7b   /    rats contained enlarged cristae and widened intermembrane spaces, which coincided with a massive mitochondrial accumulation of copper. These changes, however, preceded detectable deficits in oxidative phosphorylation and biochemical signs of oxidative damage, suggesting that the ultrastructural modifications were not the result of oxidative stress imposed by copper- dependent Fenton chemistry. In a cell-free system containing a reducing dithiol agent, isolated mitochondria exposed to copper underwent modifications that were closely related to those observed in vivo. In this cell-free system, copper induced thiol modifications of three abundant mitochondrial membrane proteins, and this correlated with reversible intramitochondrial membrane crosslinking, which was also observed in liver mitochondria from Atp7b   /    rats. In vivo, copper-chelating agents reversed mitochondrial accumulation of copper, as well as signs of intra-mitochondrial membrane crosslinking, thereby preserving the functional and structural integrity of mitochondria. Together, these findings suggest that the mitochondrion constitutes a pivotal target of copper in WD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1618</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of restriction endonucleases sensitive to 5-cytosine methylation at non-CpG sites, including expanded (CAG)n/(CTG)n repeats.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>140</offset><text>Most epigenetic studies assess methylation of 5'-CpG-3' sites but recent evidence indicates that non-CpG cytosine methylation occurs at high levels in humans and other species.

With the goal of facilitating the detection of non-CpG methylation, the restriction endonucleases ApeKI, BbvI, EcoP15I, Fnu 4HI, MwoI and TseI were assessed for their sensitivity to 5-methylcytosine at GpCpA, GpCpT, GpCpC or GpCpG sites, where methylation is catalyzed by the DNA 5-cytosine 5'-GpC-3' methyltransferase M.CviPI.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We report an altered splicing process induced by a silent substitution (c.7056C>T) in the von Willebrand factor gene in a case of type 1 von Willebrand disease originally classified as lacking von Willebrand factor mutations. RESULTS: The c.7056C>T synonymous substitution introduces a new donor splice site within exon 41, leading to messenger RNA lacking nucleotides 7055-7081 (c.7055_7081del). The encoded von Willebrand factor protein is predicted to lack amino acids 2352-2360 in the B2 domain. The patient's von Willebrand disease phenotype was characterized by reduced plasma and platelet von Willebrand factor, which was normal in function and multimer structure. In vitro expression studies demonstrated that co-transfection of equimolar c.7055_7081del and wild-type von Willebrand factor (mimicking the patient's heterozygous state) induced a 50% lower von Willebrand factor secretion than the wild type, while almost no von Willebrand factor secretion was seen with the mutated von Willebrand factor alone. The secreted von Willebrand factor was structurally and functionally normal, suggesting that the c.7056C>T substitution behaves like a loss-of-function allele.

We revised the main aspects of the natural history of dystrophinopathies to define genotype-phenotype correlations in large patient cohorts with extended follow-up. We also specifically explored subjects carrying nucleotide substitutions in the DMD gene, a comparatively less investigated DMD/BMD subgroup. We studied 320 dystrophinopathic patients (205 DMD and 115 BMD), defining muscular, cardiac, respiratory, and cognitive involvement. We also subdivided patients according to the kind of molecular defect (deletions, duplications, nucleotide substitutions or other microrearrangements) and the mutation sites (proximal/distal to exon 45), studying phenotype-genotype correlations for each group. In DMD, mutation type did not influence clinical evolution; mutations located in distal regions (irrespective of their nature) are more likely to be associated with lower IQ levels (p = 0.005). BMD carrying proximal deletions showed a higher degree of cardiac impairment than BMD with distal deletions (p = 0.0046). In the BMD population, there was a strong correlation between the entity of muscle dystrophin deficiency and clinical course (p = 0.002). An accurate knowledge of natural history may help in the clinical management of patients. Furthermore, several clinical trials are ongoing or are currently planned, some of which aim to target specific DMD mutations: a robust natural history is therefore essential to correctly design these experimental trials.</text></passage></document><document><id>1623</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[A case of retinitis pigmentosa with retinal angiomatous proliferation].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>PURPOSE: To report a first case of retinitis pigmentosa accompanied with retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP).

For the purpose of adequate genetic counseling and treatment of these patients, the full spectrum of clinical findings for each specific mutation needs to be appreciated. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. A number of studies on the relationship between genotype and phenotype concerning this specific mutation have been published. Two Dutch families with Muenke syndrome were screened for the reported characteristics of this syndrome and for additional features. New phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow, fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome. Because Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already made in a family member.</text></passage></document><document><id>1625</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[The cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A mutation and dilated cardiomyopathy].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset></passage></document><document><id>1626</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PTBP1 is required for embryonic development before gastrulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Polypyrimidine-tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) is an important cellular regulator of messenger RNAs influencing the alternative splicing profile of a cell as well as its mRNA stability, location and translation. In addition, it is diverted by some viruses to facilitate their replication. Here, we used a novel PTBP1 knockout mouse to analyse the tissue expression pattern of PTBP1 as well as the effect of its complete removal during development. We found evidence of strong PTBP1 expression in embryonic stem cells and throughout embryonic development, especially in the developing brain and spinal cord, the olfactory and auditory systems, the heart, the liver, the kidney, the brown fat and cartilage primordia. This widespread distribution points towards a role of PTBP1 during embryonic development. Homozygous offspring, identified by PCR and immunofluorescence, were able to implant but were arrested or retarded in growth. At day 7.5 of embryonic development (E7.5) the null mutants were about 5x smaller than the control littermates and the gap in body size widened with time. At mid-gestation, all homozygous embryos were resorbed/degraded. No homozygous mice were genotyped at E12 and the age of weaning. Embryos lacking PTBP1 did not display differentiation into the 3 germ layers and cavitation of the epiblast, which are hallmarks of gastrulation. In addition, homozygous mutants displayed malformed ectoplacental cones and yolk sacs, both early supportive structure of the embryo proper. We conclude that PTBP1 is not required for the earliest isovolumetric divisions and differentiation steps of the zygote up to the formation of the blastocyst. However, further post-implantation development requires PTBP1 and stalls in homozygous null animals with a phenotype of dramatically reduced size and aberration in embryonic and extra-embryonic structures.</text></passage></document><document><id>1627</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A prospective study of total gastrectomy for CDH1-positive hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome. Up to 30% of families with HDGC have mutations in the E-cadherin gene, CDH1. The role of prophylactic versus therapeutic gastrectomy for HDGC was studied prospectively. METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with CDH1 mutations and positive family history were studied prospectively, including 13 without and 5 with symptoms. Proportions were compared by Fisher's exact test, and survival by the Breslow modification of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: Each patient underwent total gastrectomy (TG), and 17 (94%) were found to have signet ring cell adenocarcinoma. Twelve of 13 asymptomatic patients had T1, N0 cancer, and only 2/12 (16%) had it diagnosed preoperatively despite state-of-the-art screening methods. Each asymptomatic patient did well postoperatively, and no patient has recurred. For five symptomatic patients, each (100%) was found to have signet ring cell adenocarcinoma (P  =  0.002 versus asymptomatic) by preoperative endoscopy; three (60%) had lymph node involvement and two (40%) had distant metastases at time of operation. Two-year survival was 100% for asymptomatic and 40% for symptomatic patients (P  &lt;  0.01). CONCLUSION: The data show that asymptomatic patients with family history of HDGC and CDH1 mutation have high probability of having signet ring cell adenocarcinoma of the stomach that is not able to be diagnosed on endoscopy; when symptoms arise, the diagnosis can be made by endoscopy, but they have metastases and decreased survival. Surveillance endoscopy is of limited value, and prophylactic gastrectomy (PG) is recommended for patients with family history of HDGC and CDH1 mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1628</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Denys-Drash syndrome with neonatal renal failure in monozygotic twins due to c.1097G>A mutation in the WT1 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>113</offset><text>Denys-Drash syndrome, characterized by nephrosis, dysgenetic gonads and a predisposition to Wilms tumor, is due to germline mutations in the WT1 gene.

Furthermore, data from resequencing of the coding regions of human CRC suggests that a relatively large number of mutations occur in individual human CRC, most at low frequency. The functional role of these low-frequency mutations in CRC, and specifically how they may cooperate with high-frequency mutations, is not well understood. One of the most common rate-limiting mutations in human CRC occurs in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. To identify mutations that cooperate with mutant APC, we performed a forward genetic screen in mice carrying a mutant allele of Apc (Apc(Min)) using Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-mediated mutagenesis. Apc(Min) SB-mutagenized mice developed three times as many polyps as mice with the Apc(Min) allele alone. Analysis of transposon common insertion sites (CIS) identified the Apc locus as a major target of SB-induced mutagenesis, suggesting that SB insertions provide an efficient route to biallelic Apc inactivation. We also identified an additional 32 CIS genes/loci that may represent modifiers of the Apc(Min) phenotype. Five CIS genes tested for their role in proliferation caused a significant change in cell viability when message levels were reduced in human CRC cells. These findings demonstrate the utility of using transposon mutagenesis to identify low-frequency and cooperating cancer genes; this approach will aid in the development of combinatorial therapies targeting this deadly disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1630</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Lesch-Nyhan variant syndrome: real-time rt-PCR for mRNA quantification in variable presentation in three affected family members.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>130</offset><text>Inherited mutations of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) give rise to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) or variants (LNV).

All 14 exons of the HGD gene were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The PCR products were then purified and analyzed by sequencing. Five mutations were identified in our samples. Four of them were novel C1273A, T1046G, 551-552insG, T533G and had not been previously reported, and one mutation T847C has been described before. The types of mutations identified were two missense mutations, one splice site mutation, one frameshift mutation, and one polymorphism.

To compare copy number abnormalities (CNAs) between cRCC from VHL patients and sporadic cRCC cases without detectable somatic VHL mutations, we analyzed 34 cRCC with Affymetrix 250K arrays. To increase the power of the study, we then combined our results with those of a previously published study and compared CNAs in VHL and non-VHL related cRCC using the genomic identification of significant targets in cancer (GISTIC) program. In VHL, cRCC GISTIC analysis identified four statistically significant regions of copy number gain and four statistically significant regions of deletion that occurred in >10% of tumors analyzed. Sporadic cRCC without detectable VHL mutations had, on average, more copy number abnormalities than VHL cRCC though the most common regions of loss/gain (e.g., 3p and 14q loss and 5q gain) were present in both tumor sets. However, CNAs on chromosome arms 7p (gain) and 8p (loss) were only detected in VHL RCC. Although individual copy number abnormality peaks contained clear candidate cancer genes in some cases (e.g., the 3p loss peak in VHL cRCC contained only six genes including VHL), most peaks contained many genes. To date, only a minority of the candidate genes included in these peaks have been analyzed for mutation or epigenetic inactivation in cRCC but TNFRSF10C and DUSP4 map to the 8p region deleted in VHL cRCC and TP53 and HIF2A (EPAS1) mapped to CNA loss and gain peaks (chromosomes 17 and 2, respectively) detected in sporadic VHL wild-type cRCC.</text></passage></document><document><id>1633</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>LAMM syndrome with middle ear dysplasia associated with compound heterozygosity for FGF3 mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset><text>We report on the first cases of FGF3 compound heterozygotes in two European families from non-consanguineous marriages, affected with labyrinthine aplasia, microtia, and microdontia (LAMM) Syndrome.

METHODS: The two sporadic patients underwent complete physical and ophthalmic examinations. Genomic DNA was extracted from the leukocytes of the peripheral blood collected from the families of the two sporadic patients and 100 unrelated control subjects from the same population. Exons 4-13 of PAX6 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced directly. The ophthalmic examinations included best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, optical coherence tomography, and Pentacam and Goldmann perimetry. RESULTS: The two patients were affected with aniridia accompanied by nystagmus. A heterozygous PAX6 frameshift mutation in exon 7, c.375_376delAG (p.Arg125SerfsX7), was identified in sporadic patient 1 and not in any of the unaffected family members and normal controls. One novel mutation in exon 10, c.868_871dupAGTT (p.Phe291X), was detected in sporadic patient 2. The frameshift mutation we identified has not previously been reported either in China or abroad. CONCLUSIONS: Although PAX6 mutations and polymorphisms have been reported in various ethnic groups, we report, for the first time, the identification of one new PAX6 mutation in Chinese aniridia patient.</text></passage></document><document><id>1635</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Longitudinal ambulatory measurements of gait abnormality in dystrophin-deficient dogs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>BACKGROUND: This study aimed to measure the gait abnormalities in GRMD (Golden retriever muscular dystrophy) dogs during growth and disease progression using an ambulatory gait analyzer (3D-accelerometers) as a possible tool to assess the effects of a therapeutic intervention. METHODS: Six healthy and twelve GRMD dogs were evaluated twice monthly, from the age of two to nine months. The evolution of each gait variable previously shown to be modified in control and dystrophin-deficient adults was assessed using two-ways variance analysis (age, clinical status) with repeated measurements. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to perfect multivariate data interpretation. RESULTS: Speed, stride length, total power and force significantly already decreased (p&lt;0.01) at the age of 2 months. The other gait variables (stride frequency, relative power distributions along the three axes) became modified at later stages. Using the PCA analysis, a global gait index taking into account the main gait variables was calculated, and was also consistent to detect the early changes in the GRMD gait patterns, as well as the progressive degradation of gait quality. CONCLUSION: The gait variables measured by the accelerometers were sensitive to early detect and follow the gait disorders and mirrored the heterogeneity of clinical presentations, giving sense to monitor gait in GRMD dogs during progression of the disease and pre-clinical therapeutic trials.</text></passage></document><document><id>1636</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>29</offset><text>Myoclonus dystonia syndrome (MDS) refers to a group of heterogeneous nondegenerative clinical conditions characterized by the association of myoclonus and dystonia as the only or prominent symptom. The "core" of MDS is represented by inherited myoclonus-dystonia (M-D), a disorder with autosomal-dominant inheritance and reduced penetrance, beginning in early childhood with a relatively benign course, with myoclonus as the most predominant and disabling symptom. Alcohol responsiveness and psychiatric symptoms are characteristic features. Mutations in the epsilon-sarcoglycan gene (SGCE, DYT11) represent the major genetic cause, but M-D is genetically heterogeneous. In a variable proportion of M-D patients no mutation is found, and at least one other locus (DYT15) has been linked to the disease. Patients with primary dystonia, with or without the DYT1 mutation, may show irregular and arrhythmic jerky movements associated with dystonia. Usually dystonia is the prominent symptom and the myoclonic jerk involves the same body region; this condition, currently defined as "myoclonic dystonia," is included in the spectrum of MDS. Dopa-responsive dystonia due to mutation in the GTP-CH gene and vitamin E deficiency can present with a phenotype of dystonia and myoclonus in combination; both conditions should be considered in the diagnostic approach to patients since they are potentially treatable.</text></passage></document><document><id>1637</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nucleosomal occupancy and CGG repeat expansion: a comparative analysis of triplet repeat region from mouse and human fragile X mental retardation gene 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>154</offset><text>The expansion of CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of FMR1 gene is the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome in most of the patients. The nature of the flanking sequences in addition to the length and interruption pattern of repeats is predicted to influence CGG repeat instability in the FMR1 gene. We investigated nucleosome occupancy as a contributor to CGG repeat instability in a transgenic mouse model containing unstable (CGG)(26,) from human FMR1 cloned downstream of nucleosome-excluding sequence. We observe that the transgene has an open chromatin structure compared to the stable endogenous mouse Fmr1 within the same nucleus. CGG repeats in mouse Fmr1 are flanked by nucleosomes unlike the repeats in the transgene in all the tissues examined. Further in vitro chromatin reconstitution experiments show that DNA fragment without the SV40ori/EPR (nucleosome-excluding sequence) forms more stable chromatin than the one containing it, despite having the same number of CGG repeats. The correlation between nucleosomal organisation of the FMR1 gene and CGG repeat instability was supported by significantly lower frequency of repeat expansion in mice containing an identical transgene without the SV40ori/EPR. Our studies demonstrate that flanking DNA sequences can influence repeat instability through modulation of nucleosome occupancy in the region.</text></passage></document><document><id>1638</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Modification to reporting of qualitative fluorescent spot test results improves detection of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient heterozygote female newborns.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>174</offset><text>INTRODUCTION: The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) fluorescent spot test (FST) is a useful screening test for G6PD deficiency, but is unable to detect heterozygote G6PD-deficient females. We sought to identify whether reporting intermediate fluorescence in addition to absent and bright fluorescence on FST would improve identification of mildly deficient female heterozygotes. METHODS: A total of 1266 cord blood samples (705 male, 561 female) were screened for G6PD deficiency using FST (in-house method) and a quantitative enzyme assay. Fluorescence intensity of the FST was graded as either absent, intermediate or normal. Samples identified as showing absent or intermediate fluorescence on FST were analysed for the presence of G6PD mutations using TaqMan@SNP genotyping assays and direct nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 1266 samples, 87 samples were found to be intermediate or deficient by FST (49 deficient, 38 intermediate). Of the 49 deficient samples, 48 had G6PD enzyme activity of  &lt;= 9.5 U/g Hb and one sample had normal enzyme activity. All 38 intermediate samples were from females. Of these, 21 had G6PD activity of between 20% and 60%, and 17 samples showed normal G6PD activity. Twenty-seven of the 38 samples were available for mutation analysis of which 13 had normal G6PD activity. Eleven of the 13 samples with normal G6PD activity had identifiable G6PD mutations. CONCLUSION: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase heterozygote females cannot be identified by FST if fluorescence is reported as absent or present. Distinguishing samples with intermediate fluorescence from absent and bright fluorescence improves detection of heterozygote females with mild G6PD deficiency. Mutational studies confirmed that 85% of intermediate samples with normal enzyme activity had identifiable G6PD mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1639</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of the Alternative Splicing of an FGFR2 Transcript Due to a Novel 5' Splice Site Mutation (1084+1G>A): Case Report.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>125</offset><text>Craniosynostosis is characterized by premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures and is associated with mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes.

To test for a possible relationship between BRCA1 and p53, we compared p53 expression by immunohistochemical analysis in 29 BRCA1-associated breast cancers from 19 families, and in 200 consecutive sporadic breast cancers. We observed a prevalence of tumors with p53 positive staining in the BRCA1 population (p=0.003). In addition, p53 expression was affected by the site of the germ line mutation in the BRCA1 gene. p53 staining was found more consistently in tumors associated with mutations that lead to a truncation of BRCA1 in the ring finger region (p=0.0048). These results favor the hypothesis of a cooperation between BRCA1 and p53.

Pakistani population has a very rich anthrogeneological background with waves of migration from neighboring regions. Incidence rates of breast and ovarian cancer in Pakistan are on such a rapid rise that it is necessary to check the contributory factors, genetic and nongenetic. An insight into the prevalence data emphasizes the formulation of a BRCA1 and BRCA2 database for the Pakistani population. Method. In this study conducted by authors, data from diagnosed cases of both sporadic and inherited female breast and ovarian cancer cases was gathered after performing molecular genetic analysis by screening for alterations in the coding sequence of the BRCA gene. The region of interest was analyzed by the aid of various molecular biology tools such as automated DNA sequencer. Bioinformatics software was used to interpret the results, and database was prepared. Results. Mutational screening of the exons in all the samples of our study group did not reveal any pathogenic mutation. These results along with the results of the previous Pakistani studies for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were summed up to prepare a Pakistani database. Percentage involvement of these genes was estimated. Nine percent of these cancers show alterations in BRCA1 gene while 3 percent have shown BRCA2 variants. The remaining 88 percent of breast and ovarian cancers can be attributed to the involvement of other genes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1643</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Effects of splicing mutations on NF2-transcripts: transcript analysis and information theoretic predictions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>This study examined the effects of 22 putative splicing mutations in the NF2 gene by means of transcript analysis and information theory based prediction.

Six were outside these dinucleotide regions but within the more broadly defined splicing regions used in the information theory based model. Two others were in introns and outside the broadly defined regions. Transcript analysis revealed exon skipping or activation of one or more cryptic splicing sites for 17 mutations. No alterations were found for the two intronic mutations and for three mutations in the broadly defined splicing regions. Concordance and partial concordance between the calculated predictions and the results of transcript analysis were found for 14 and 6 mutations, respectively. For two mutations, the predicted alteration was not found in the transcripts. Our results demonstrate that the effects of splicing mutations in NF2 are often complex and that information theory based analysis is helpful in elucidating the consequences of these mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1644</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Global analysis of parental imprinting in human parthenogenetic induced pluripotent stem cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>To study the role of parental imprinting in human embryogenesis, we generated parthenogenetic human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a homozygote diploid karyotype. Global gene expression and DNA methylation analyses of the parthenogenetic cells enabled the identification of the entire repertoire of paternally expressed genes. We thus demonstrated that the gene U5D, encoding a variant of the U5 small RNA component of the spliceosome, is an imprinted gene. Introduction of the U5D gene into parthenogenetic cells partially corrected their molecular phenotype. Our analysis also uncovered multiple miRNAs existing as imprinted clustered transcripts, whose putative targets we then studied further. Examination of the consequences of parthenogenesis on human development identified marked effects on the differentiation of extraembryonic trophectoderm and embryonic liver and muscle tissues. This analysis suggests that distinct regulatory imprinted small RNAs and their targets have substantial roles in human development.</text></passage></document><document><id>1645</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Apc gene-mutations in familial adenomatous polyposis-coli identified at the DNA and protein level.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>Peripheral blood cell DNA of patients suffering from Familial Adenomatous Polyposis coli (FAP) were subjected to SSCP screening analyses.

Examination of DNA derived from pooled adenomas of the same patient confirmed the inherited mutation. Western blot analysis with an APC N-terminus specific antiserum (anti-APC123) applied to tumor-derived proteins identified a polypeptide chain of 140 kD corresponding to the truncation induced by the APC germline mutation. We further examined DNA isolated individually from eight adenomas of the same patient. The analysis revealed the surprising observation, that three out of eight tumor samples analyzed, gave rise to a predominant PCR-amplified band of normal size, implicating that the allele containing the germline deletion had been lost, and instead hemi-/homozygosity for the somatic, not for the germline mutation had been aquired as a tertiary event.

Mutations were located all over the gene and included three nonsense mutations, two splice-site mutations, six small deletions or insertions, and seven missense mutations. We compared frequencies of clinical symptoms in MLL2 mutation carriers versus non-carriers. MLL2 mutation carriers significantly more often presented with short stature and renal anomalies (p  =  0.026 and 0.031, respectively), and in addition, MLL2 carriers obviously showed more frequently a typical facial gestalt (17/19) compared with non-carriers (9/15), although this result was not statistically significant (p  =  0.1). Mutation-negative patients were subsequently tested for mutations in ten functional candidate genes (e.g. MLL, ASC2, ASH2L, and WDR5), but no convincing causative mutations could be found. Our results indicate that MLL2 is the major gene for Kabuki syndrome with a wide spectrum of de novo mutations and strongly suggest further genetic heterogeneity.</text></passage></document><document><id>1648</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[X-linked progressive muscular dystrophies with early onset and contractures (review of the literature)].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>106</offset></passage></document><document><id>1649</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutational analysis of VACM-1/cul5 exons in cancer cell lines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset><text>VACM-1, a cul-5 gene product, functions via an E3 ligase complex and when overexpressed, has an antiproliferative effect in many cell types. Overexpression of VACM-/cul5 cDNA mutated at the PKA-specific phosphorylation site at Ser730 reversed this phenotype. These effects are associated with the appearance of larger M(r) species subsequently identified as a Nedd8-modified VACM-1/cul5. Although decreased levels of VACM-1 mRNA detected in several cancers and cancer cell lines may explain the progression of cell growth, possible genetic and epigenetic changes in its sequence have not been analyzed. We hypothesized that in rapidly proliferating cells, VACM-1/cul5 may be mutated at either the PKA-specific phosphorylation site or the consensus neddylation site. We used RT-PCR and PCR, to amplify and to sequence mRNA and genomic DNA, respectively. To date we have sequenced all 19 coding exons of the VACM-1/cul5 gene in T47D breast cancer cells, U138MG glioma cells, ACHN renal cancer cells, and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. Our results indicate that in those cells VACM-1/cul5 is not mutated at the putative phosphorylation or the neddylation site. We have found one silent mutation in the genomic DNA isolated from U138MG, ACHN, and OVCAR-3 cell lines, but not from T47D cells. Our work suggests that in T47D breast cancer cells biologic activity of VACM-1/cul5 may be regulated by posttranslational modifications.</text></passage></document><document><id>1650</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>EAF2 loss enhances angiogenic effects of Von Hippel-Lindau heterozygosity on the murine liver and prostate.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease results from the inactivation of the VHL gene and is characterized by highly vascular tumors. A consequence of VHL loss is the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunits and increased expression of HIF target genes, which include pro-angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In mice, homozygous deletion of VHL is embryonic lethal due to vascular abnormalities in the placenta; and, VHL(+/-) mice develop proliferative vascular lesions in several major organs, most prominently the liver. Loss of ELL-associated factor (EAF2) in murine models has also been shown to induce increased vascular density in the liver as well as the prostate. Previously, EAF2 was determined to be a binding partner of VHL and loss of EAF2 induced a reduction in pVHL levels and an increase in hypoxia induced factor 1a (HIF1a) levels in vitro. Here we characterized the cooperative effects of VHL- and EAF2-deficiency on angiogenesis in the liver and prostate of male mice. VHL deficiency consistently increased the incidence of hepatic vascular lesions across three mouse strains. These vascular lesions where characterized by an increase in microvessel density, and staining intensity of VHL target proteins HIF1a and VEGF. EAF2(-/-)VHL(+/-) mice had increased incidence of proliferative hepatic vascular lesions (4/4) compared to VHL(+/-) (10/18) and EAF2(-/-) (0/5) mice. Prostates of EAF2(-/-)VHL(+/-) mice also displayed an increase in microvessel density, as well as stromal inflammation and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. These results suggest that cooperation of VHL and EAF2 may be critical for angiogenic regulation of the liver and prostate, and concurrent loss of these two tumor suppressors may result in a pro-angiogenic phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>1651</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Jewish genetic screening grows despite questions about breadth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>64</offset></passage></document><document><id>1652</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Spinophilin loss contributes to tumorigenesis in vivo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>55</offset><text>The scaffold protein spinophilin (SPN, PPP1R9B) is a regulatory subunit of phosphatase-1a located at 17q21.31. This region is frequently associated with microsatellite instability and LOH and contains a relatively high density of known tumor suppressor genes (such as BRCA1), putative tumor suppressor genes and several unidentified candidate tumor suppressor genes located distal to BRCA1. Spn is located distal to BRCA1, and we have previously shown that the loss of Spn contributes to human tumorigenesis in the absence of p53 function. In this work, we explore the role of Spn as putative tumor suppressor in in vivo models using genetically modified mice. Spn-knockout mice had decreased lifespan with increased cellular proliferation in tissues such as the mammary ducts and early appearance of tumors, such as lymphoma. Furthermore, the combined loss of Spn and mutant p53 activity led to increased mammary carcinomas, confirming the functional relationship between p53 and Spn. We suggest that Spn may be a novel tumor suppressor located at 17q21.</text></passage></document><document><id>1653</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Somatic alterations of the DPC4 gene in human colorectal cancers in vivo. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS  The chromosome region 18q21 has been shown to be frequently deleted in colorectal cancers , and such frequent allelic loss is a hallmark of the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene . The DPC4 gene , which is located at 18q21 , has been identified as a tumor-suppressor gene from examination of pancreatic cancers . The aim of the present study was to determine if it might also be altered in colorectal cancers . METHODS  Mutation analyses of the DPC4 gene were performed on complementary DNA samples from 31 primary colorectal cancer specimens using a combination of polymerase chain reaction , single-strand conformation polymorphism , and DNA sequencing . RESULTS  Four missense mutations producing amino acid substitutions and a somatic 12-base pair deletion in the coding region of the DPC4 gene were detected in the 31 cancers ( 16 % ; 5 of 31 ) . CONCLUSIONS  The DPC4 gene may play a role as a tumor-suppressor gene in a fraction of colorectal cancers ; however , while allelic loss at 18q21 is very often seen in colorectal cancers , only a minority show DPC4 mutations , suggesting that there might be another tumor-suppressor gene in this chromosome region . . </text></passage></document><document><id>1654</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation in 5' upstream region of GCHI gene causes familial dopa-responsive dystonia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset></passage></document><document><id>1655</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Phenotype-Genotype Discrepancy Due to a 5.5-kb Deletion in the GALT Gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>Classical galactosemia is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). More than 200 mutations have been described in the GALT gene. A 5.5-kb GALT deletion, first described in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, may lead either to an erroneous genotype assignment of classical galactosemia or to discrepancies with parental genotypes and the expected biochemical phenotype. The presence of the 5.5-kb deletion was examined in 27 Mexican nonrelated families with at least one child with reduced GALT activity in erythrocytes and it was detected in the 5.5% (n=3) of the 54 alleles tested. The first molecular studies in three of our families showed that the genotypes of the parents were inconsistent with those of their children, which were considered initially as homozygous p.N314D-Duarte 2, but after analyzing for the presence of the 5.5-kb deletion, were reassigned as compound heterozygotes [5.5-kb deletion]+[p.N314D-Duarte 2]. Identification of the 5.5-kb deletion in Mexican patients suggests that this mutation might not be exclusive to a given ethnic group and should be tested in other populations, especially when there is a discrepancy between the genotypes of patients and parents or by incongruence between biochemical phenotype and GALT genotype. Establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation for the 5.5-kb GALT deletion and determining the appropriate management will require additional studies in patients with a G/G genotype bearing the 5.5-kb GALT deletion.</text></passage></document><document><id>1656</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Rare germline variants in regions of loss of heterozygosity may influence clinical course of hematological malignancies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset></passage></document><document><id>1657</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic evidence that Neisseria gonorrhoeae produces specific receptors for transferrin and lactoferrin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>105</offset><text>Transferrin (TF) and lactoferrin (LF) are probably the major sources of iron (Fe) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in vivo. We isolated mutants of N. gonorrhoeae FA19 that were unable to grow with Fe bound to either TF (TF-) or LF (LF-) or to both TF and LF ([TF LF]-). The amount of Fe internalized by each of the mutants was reduced to background levels from the relevant iron source(s). The wild-type parent strain exhibited saturable specific binding of TF and LF; receptor activity was induced by Fe starvation. The TF(-)-specific or LF(-)-specific mutants were almost completely lacking in receptor activity for TF or LF, respectively, whereas the [TF LF]- mutants bound both TF and LF as well as the wild-type strain. All mutants utilized citrate and heme normally as Fe sources. These results demonstrate that ability to bind TF or LF is essential for gonococci to scavenge appreciable amounts of Fe from these sources in vitro. In addition, the TF and LF Fe acquisition pathways are linked by the mutual use of a nonreceptor gene product that is essential to Fe scavenging from both of these sources; this gene product is not required for Fe acquisition from other sources.</text></passage></document><document><id>1658</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Normocholesterolemic dysbetalipoproteinemia with xanthomatosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>64</offset><text>A patient is described who has marked palmar xanthomatosis associated with a normal concentration of plasma cholesterol. Analysis of xanthomas revealed them to contain large quantities of cholesterol with both intra- and extracellular lipids. Examination of plasma lipoproteins showed them to be consistent with a pattern of dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipoproteinemia). VLDL had beta-mobility on electrophoresis, a high cholesterol/triglyceride ratio, and increased apoprotein B. However, arginine-rich apoprotein was not increased in VLDL, in contrast to hypercholesterolemic patients with the Type III pattern. Nevertheless, the E3 subfraction of the arginine-rich apoprotein was virtually absent, which is characteristic of dysbetalipoproteinemia. Cholesterol and bile acid synthesis were in the normal range. Thus, of particular interest was the development of severe xanthomatosis without hypercholesterolemia in this patient. Therefore, tissue accumulation of cholesterol was apparently the result of a qualitative abnormality in lipoproteins and not due to an excess of plasma cholesterol.</text></passage></document><document><id>1659</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Therapeutic prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset></passage></document><document><id>1660</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial forms of diabetes insipidus: clinical and molecular characteristics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>Over the past two decades, the genetic and molecular basis of familial forms of diabetes insipidus has been elucidated. Diabetes insipidus is a clinical syndrome characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of diluted urine (polyuria) and increased fluid intake (polydipsia). The most common type of diabetes insipidus is caused by lack of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (vasopressin), which is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted by the neurohypophysis. This type of diabetes insipidus is referred to here as neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. The syndrome can also result from resistance to the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin on the kidney, either at the level of the vasopressin 2 receptor or the aquaporin 2 water channel (which mediates the re-absorption of water from urine), and is referred to as renal or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between these two types of diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia can be difficult owing to the existence of partial as well as complete forms of vasopressin deficiency or resistance. Seven different familial forms of diabetes insipidus are known to exist. The clinical presentation, genetic basis and cellular mechanisms responsible for them vary considerably. This information has led to improved methods of differential diagnosis and could provide the basis of new forms of therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>1661</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sub-diffraction imaging of huntingtin protein aggregates by fluorescence blink-microscopy and atomic force microscopy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset></passage></document><document><id>1662</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fraternal twins with Aarskog-Scott syndrome due to maternal germline mosaicism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Aarskog-Scott syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder with characteristic facial, skeletal, and genital abnormalities.

This study focused on the poorly studied linker region of the cancer-associated BRCA2 protein encoded by exons twelve through fourteen of BRCA2. To develop a new method to characterize VUS in this region of BRCA2, we first chose to study 4 reported VUS occurring on evolutionarily conserved residues within the linker region. To determine if these VUS represent neutral changes or if they impact the function of the BRCA2 protein, we stably transfected expression plasmids encoding wild-type or each mutant peptide into T47D breast cancer cells, which are wild-type for BRCA2. Four mutant peptide expressing cell lines and a wild-type linker region expressing cell line next were studied by challenging transfected cell lines with the DNA crosslinking compound cisplatin (10 M) for 5days. Expression of the wild-type linker region and certain mutant linker peptides (N2452D and I2285V) decreased apoptosis (as demonstrated by cell death detection assay) in transfected cell lines, indicating that the linker region peptide directly or indirectly affects the DNA damage repair pathway. By determining the cell survival and assaying the apoptotic index of treated cell lines, one could potentially use this screen to determine that a particular VUS has a functional impact on BRCA2 function, and hence is of functional significance. We conclude that this method is useful for screening the effect of linker region VUS on BRCA2 function, and to identify mutations for further testing. We also conclude that mutations in the linker region may have heretofore unappreciated roles in BRCA2 function.</text></passage></document><document><id>1665</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Founding BRCA1 mutations in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in southern Sweden. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>85</offset><text>Nine different germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene were identified in 15 of 47 kindreds from southern Sweden , by use of SSCP and heteroduplex analysis of all exons and flanking intron region and by a protein-truncation test for exon 11 , followed by direct sequencing .

Using Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, an animal model of WD, the study was undertaken to identify proteins involved in the process of WD and to investigate their functional roles in copper-induced hepatotoxicity. In early stages, expression levels of mitochondrial matrix proteins including agmatinase, isovaleryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, and cytochrome b5 were downregulated. As mitochondrial injuries progressed, along with subsequent apoptotic processes, expressions of malate dehydrogenase 1, annexin A5, transferrin, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, and sulfite oxidase 1 were differentially regulated. Notably, the expression of malate dehydrogenase 1 was downregulated while the annexin A5 was overexpressed in an age-dependent manner, indicating that these proteins may be involved in the WD process. In addition, pronounced under-expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in elderly LEC rats, also involved in monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism, indicates that this protein might be related to the development of neurological manifestations in WD. The results of our study help to understand the pathogenic process of WD in hepatic tissues, identifying the important proteins associated with the disease process of WD, and to investigate the molecular pathogenic process underlying the development of neurological manifestations in WD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1671</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Isolation and heterologous expression of a cDNA encoding bovine inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>102</offset><text>Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, an enzyme of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 1-position phosphate from inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate.

Northern and dot blot analysis of intestinal mRNA of one patient (M. P.) revealed a normal-sized apolipoprotein B mRNA which was present in slightly reduced amounts. At the cellular level apolipoprotein B was detected in both intestinal and hepatic biopsies, of one patient (S.

The level of apolipoprotein B-48 appeared to increase in the intestine after a fatty meal. In the other patient (M.

The glycosylation and processing of two intestinal membrane enzymes, sucrase-isomaltase and aminopeptidase N, were also normal. Although lipids and apolipoprotein B-48 were present intracellularly, no lipoprotein-like particles were observed by electron microscopy in the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, or in the intercellular spaces of intestinal biopsies obtained in the fasted (M.

The defect in these cases of abetalipoproteinemia, therefore, does not appear to involve the apolipoprotein B gene nor the synthesis or the glycosylation of the apolipoprotein but instead appears to involve some aspect of lipoprotein assembly or secretion.</text></passage></document><document><id>1675</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[LCAT deficiency: a nephrological diagnosis].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>46</offset><text>A genetic mendelian autosomal recessive condition of deficiency of lecithin- cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) can produce two different diseases: one highly interesting nephrologic picture of complete enzymatic deficiency (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency; OMIM ID #245900; FLD), characterized by the association of dyslipidemia, corneal opacities, anemia and progressive nephropathy; and a partial form (fish eye disease; OMIM ID #136120; FED) with dyslipidemia and progressive corneal opacities only. The diagnosis of FLD falls first of all under the competence of nephrologists, because end-stage renal disease appears to be its most severe outcome. The diagnostic suspicion is based on clinical signs (corneal opacities, more severe anemia than expected for the degree of chronic renal failure, progressive proteinuric nephropathy) combined with histology obtained by kidney biopsy (glomerulopathy evolving toward sclerosis with distinctive lipid deposition). However, the final diagnosis, starting with a finding of extremely low levels of HDL-cholesterol, requires collaboration with lipidology Centers that can perform sophisticated investigations unavailable in common laboratories. To be heterozygous for a mutation of the LCAT gene is one of the monogenic conditions underlying primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia (OMIM ID #604091). This disease, which is characterized by levels of HDL-cholesterol below the 5th percentile of those of the examined population (&lt;28 mg/dL for Italians), has heritability estimates between 40% and 60% and is considered to be a predisposing condition for coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, some monogenic forms, and especially those associated with LCAT deficiency, seem to break the rule, confirming once more the value of a proper diagnosis before drawing prognostic conclusions from a laboratory marker. As in many other rare illnesses, trying to discover all the existing cases will contribute to allow studies broad enough to pave the way for further therapies, in this case also fostering the production by industries of the lacking enzyme by genetic engineering. Epidemiological studies, although done on selected populations such as hypoalphalipoproteinemia patients on dialysis and with the effective genetic tools of today, have been disappointing in elucidating the disease. Spreading the clinical knowledge of the disease and its diagnostic course among nephrologists seems to be the best choice, and this is the aim of our work.</text></passage></document><document><id>1676</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Homozygosity for the MTX1 c.184T>A (p.S63T) alteration modifies the age of onset in GBA-associated Parkinson's disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>120</offset><text>A strong association was established between the GBA gene and Parkinson's disease (PD) worldwide. The most frequent GBA mutation among the Ashkenazi population (p.N370S) was previously associated with the c.1051T>C (p.F351L) alteration in the closely located MTX1 gene. We further studied the association between these two genes and its possible effect on PD. The entire coding region and exon-intron boundaries of MTX1 were analyzed in 81 PD patient carriers of GBA mutations, 15 healthy controls that carry GBA mutations, and in 25 non-carrier patients. Among them, the MTX1 c.184T>A (p.S63T) variation was detected in 93% of GBA mutation carriers (both patients and healthy controls) and in 64% of non-carrier patients (p   =   0.0008). This alteration was analyzed in 600 consecutively recruited Ashkenazi PD patients and in 353 controls, all genotyped for the LRRK2 p.G2019S and GBA founder mutations. A significantly higher frequency of the MTX1 c.184A allele was found in carriers of GBA mutations compared to non-carriers (0.67 and 0.45, respectively, p   &lt;   0.0001). The homozygous MTX1 c.184A/A genotype was associated with a significantly earlier age of motor symptoms onset in patients with GBA mutations compared to other groups of patients tested (5.1-5.9  years younger, p   =   0.002-0.01). A significantly higher frequency of early-onset PD (&lt;50  years) was detected among patients carrying both GBA mutation and the homozygous MTX1 c.184A/A genotype (35.9%, compared to 13.6-17.5%, p   =   0.028). Our results raise the possibility that alteration on the opposite allele, which is in trans to the GBA mutant allele, may affect the clinical course of GBA-associated PD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1677</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel mutation in CACNA1S gene associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis which has a gender difference in the penetrance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>129</offset><text>Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by periodic attacks of muscle weakness associated with a decrease in the serum potassium level.

To further reveal the genetic causes of HypoPP, we genotyped members of a five-generational Chinese family with HypoPP patients and identified a novel His916Gln mutation in all male HypoPP patients of the family. Clinical analysis demonstrated that the penetrance of the mutation was complete in male carriers, but we did not find evident clinical features in female carriers.

The aim of the study is to decipher the mechanism of disease expression in a female patient with a heterozygous mutation on the X-chromosome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data was extracted from the Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Registry. Genomic ribonucleic acid (DNA) and complementary DNA (cDNA) underwent Sanger sequencing. Protein analysis was performed by flow cytometry. X-inactivation patterns were analyzed by evaluating the DNA methylation status and cDNA clonal expression of several genes on the X-chromosome. SNP array was used for molecular karyotyping of the X-chromosome. RESULTS: A female with thrombocytopenia, eczema and mild T-lymphocyte abnormalities with extensive negative diagnostic testing, was suspected to have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS)/X-linked thrombocytopenia. Although the girl had a mutation (c.397G   >   A, p.E133K) in only one allele, she was found to have an extremely skewed X-inactivation pattern and no expression of the WAS protein. Family studies using DNA methylation analysis and cDNA clonal expression of several genes on the X-chromosome demonstrated that the patient developed de-novo non-random inactivation of the X-chromosome that does not carry the mutation. Genome-wide high-density molecular karyotyping excluded deletions and amplifications as a cause for the non-random inactivation of one X-chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes the need to test selected female patients with complete or incomplete disease expression for X-linked disorders even in the absence of a family history.</text></passage></document><document><id>1681</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular heterogeneity of classical and Duarte galactosemia: mutation analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>Classical galactosemia is caused by one common missense mutation ( Q188R ) and by several rare mutations in the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase ( GALT ) gene .

In this study, we report the crystal structure of APC-ARM (residues 407-775), which was determined to 2.9    resolution. Our structure shows that the seven armadillo repeats of APC-ARM fold together into a compact domain, with Arm2 and Arm5 presenting some deviations from canonical armadillo repeats. There is a positively charged groove on the surface of APC-ARM, which might be the recognition site for APC-binding partners. Comparison of this structure with our previously reported structure of APC (407-751), together with normal mode analysis, reveals that the APC-ARM domain possesses a limited intrinsic flexibility. We propose that this intrinsic flexibility might be an inherent property of ARM domains in general.</text></passage></document><document><id>1683</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Different phenotypic consequences of simultaneous versus stepwise Apc loss.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>APC is considered a gatekeeper for colorectal cancer (CRC). Cells with heterozygous APC mutations have altered expression profiles suggesting that the first APC hit may help set the stage for subsequent transformation. Therefore, we measured transformation efficiency following what we have designated as 'simultaneous' versus 'stepwise' Apc loss. We combined a conditional Apc allele (Apc(CKO)) with a Cre reporter gene and an out-of-frame Cre allele (Pms2(cre)) that stochastically becomes functional by a frameshift mutation in single cells. Loss of one Apc allele (Apc(CKO/+)) had little consequence, whereas simultaneous loss of both Apc alleles (Apc(CKO/CKO)) resulted in increased clonal expansion (crypt fission), consistent with the gatekeeper function of Apc. Interestingly, our analyses showed that most of the Apc-deficient crypts in Apc(CKO/CKO) mice appeared normal, with morphological transformation, including b-catenin deregulation, occurring in only 17% of such crypts. To determine whether transformation efficiency was different following stepwise Apc loss, we combined Apc(CKO) with a germline mutant allele, either Apc(Min) or Apc(1638N). Transformation efficiency following stepwise Apc loss (Apc(Min/CKO) or Apc(1638N/CKO)) was increased five-fold and essentially all of the Apc-deficient cells were dysplastic. In summary, our data suggest that the gatekeeper function of Apc consists of two roles, clonal expansion and morphological transformation, because simultaneous Apc loss frequently leads to occult clonal expansion without morphological transformation, whereas stepwise Apc loss more often results in visible neoplasia. Finally, that Apc-deficient cells in certain scenarios can retain a normal phenotype is unexpected and may have clinical implications for surveillance strategies to prevent CRC.</text></passage></document><document><id>1684</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Should the presence of germline BRCA1/2 mutations influence treatment selection in breast cancer?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset></passage></document><document><id>1685</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[A case of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis with convulsive seizures].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>69</offset><text>A 35 year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of convulsive seizures.

Early diagnosis and treatment of endolymphatic sac tumors can prevent audiovestibular morbidity, but optimal endolymphatic sac tumor surveillance strategy has yet to be determined. We aimed to evaluate endolymphatic sac tumor surveillance to determine the best surveillance strategy. METHODS: : In a national prospective study, 40 VHL mutation carriers were interviewed about audiovestibular symptoms and had audiological examinations and magnetic resonance imaging of the inner ear. Further, we performed a meta-analysis including all reported endolymphatic sac tumor von Hippel-Lindau disease cases in the literature (N = 140 with 156 endolymphatic sac tumors). RESULTS: : In the prospective study, endolymphatic sac tumors were suspected based on audiovestibular symptoms, audiometry, and magnetic resonance imaging in 34%, 30%, and 12.5% of subjects, respectively. In total, more than 90% of radiologically diagnosed endolymphatic sac tumors were associated with abnormal audiometric findings. No endolymphatic sac tumor genotype-phenotype correlations were found. CONCLUSION: : We recommend annual audiometry as a first-line endolymphatic sac tumor screening tool, and in countries where periodic surveillance magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system is performed, specific images of the inner ear should be included. Audiometric abnormalities in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease without magnetic resonance imaging-visible endolymphatic sac tumors could be due to microscopic endolymphatic sac tumors. Determination of audiometric endolymphatic sac tumor characteristics could further target screening and improve endolymphatic sac tumor diagnosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1687</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Severe dysfunction of respiratory chain and cholesterol metabolism in Atp7b(-/-) mice as a model for Wilson disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>Wilson disease (WD) is caused by mutations of the WD gene ATP7B resulting in copper accumulation in different tissues.

Therefore, we studied age-dependent (3, 6, 47weeks) biochemical and bioenergetical changes in Atp7b(-/-) mice focusing on liver and brain. Mutant mice showed strongly elevated copper and iron levels. Age-dependently decreasing hepatic reduced glutathione levels along with increasing oxidized to reduced glutathione ratios in liver and brain of 47weeks old mice as well as elevated hepatic and cerebral superoxide dismutase activities in 3weeks old mutant mice highlighted oxidative stress in the investigated tissues. We could not find evidence that amino acid metabolism or beta-oxidation is impaired by deficiency of ATP7B. In contrast, sterol metabolism was severely dysregulated. In brains of 3week old mice cholesterol, 8-dehydrocholesterol, desmosterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and lathosterol were all highly increased. These changes reversed age-dependently resulting in reduced levels of all previously increased sterol metabolites in 47weeks old mice. A similar pattern of sterol metabolite changes was found in hepatic tissue, though less pronounced. Moreover, mitochondrial energy production was severely affected. Respiratory chain complex I activity was increased in liver and brain of mutant mice, whereas complex II, III, and IV activities were reduced. In addition, aconitase activity was diminished in brains of Atp7b(-/-) mice.

Several lines of evidence also suggest important roles for HIF-independent VHL functions in the maintenance of primary cilium, extracellular matrix formation, and tumor suppression. We undertook a series of proteomic analyses to gain a comprehensive picture of the VHL-interacting proteins. We found that the ARF tumor suppressor interacts with VHL30, a longer VHL isoform, but not with VHL19, a shorter VHL isoform. ARF was found to release VHL30 from the E3 ligase complex, promoting the binding of VHL30 to a protein arginine methyltransferase, PRMT3.

Previous studies have shown that OCRL interacts with components of the endosomal machinery; however, its role in endocytosis, and thus the pathogenic mechanisms of Lowe syndrome, have remained elusive. Here, we show that via its 5-phosphatase activity, OCRL controls early endosome (EE) function. OCRL depletion impairs the recycling of multiple classes of receptors, including megalin (which mediates protein reabsorption in the kidney) that are retained in engorged EEs. These trafficking defects are caused by ectopic accumulation of PtdIns4,5P(2) in EEs, which in turn induces an N-WASP-dependent increase in endosomal F-actin. Our data provide a molecular explanation for renal proximal tubular dysfunction in Lowe syndrome and highlight that tight control of PtdIns4,5P(2) and F-actin at the EEs is essential for exporting cargoes that transit this compartment.</text></passage></document><document><id>1695</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fanconi- Bickel Syndrome: mutation in an Indian patient.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>57</offset><text>Fanconi -Bickel Syndrome (FBS) is described as an autosomal recessive Glycogen Storage Disorder type XI.

X-linked diseases such as hemophilia B offer an opportunity to examine recent germ-line mutations in humans. By utilizing the direct sequencing method of genomic amplification with transcript sequencing, eight regions (2.46 kb) of likely functional significance in the factor IX gene have been sequenced in a total of 60 consecutive, unrelated hemophiliacs. The high frequency of patient ascertainment from three regions in the midwestern United States and Canada suggests that the sample is representative of hemophiliacs of northern European descent. Twenty-six of the delineated mutations are reported herein, and the group of 60 is analyzed as a whole. From the pattern of mutations causing disease and from a knowledge of evolutionarily conserved amino acids, it is possible to reconstruct the underlying pattern of mutation and to calculate the mutation rates per base pair per generation for transitions (27 x 10(-10)), transversions (4.1 x 10(-10), and deletions (0.9 x 10(-10)) for a total mutation rate of 32 x 10(-10). The proportion of transitions at non-CpG nucleotides is elevated sevenfold over that expected if one base substitution were as likely as another. At the dinucleotide CpG, transitions are elevated 24-fold relative to transitions at other sites. The pattern of spontaneous mutations in factor IX resembles that observed in Escherichia coli when the data are corrected for ascertainment bias. The aggregate data hint that most mutations may be due to endogenous processes. The following additional conclusions emerge from the data: (1) Although in recent decades reproductive fitness in individuals with mild and moderate hemophilia has been approximately normal, the large number of different mutations found strongly suggest that these levels of disease substantially compromised reproduction in previous centuries. (2) Mutations which putatively affect splicing account for at least 13% of independent mutations, indicating that the division of the gene into eight exons presents a significant genetic cost for the organism. In one individual a "silent" mutation at lysine 5 is likely to cause hemophilia by generating a perfect splice donor consensus sequence in exon b. (3) All the missense mutations occurred at evolutionarily conserved amino acids. As additional data are generated on the pattern of mutations caused by specific mutagens, it will be possible to utilize the pattern of spontaneous mutation to estimate the maximal contribution of that mutagen during the past century.</text></passage></document><document><id>1697</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of pathogenic germline mutations in human protein kinases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Protein Kinases are a superfamily of proteins involved in crucial cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. Accordingly, they play an important role in cancer biology. To contribute to the study of the relation between kinases and disease we compared pathogenic mutations to neutral mutations as an extension to our previous analysis of cancer somatic mutations. First, we analyzed native and mutant proteins in terms of amino acid composition. Secondly, mutations were characterized according to their potential structural effects and finally, we assessed the location of the different classes of polymorphisms with respect to kinase-relevant positions in terms of subfamily specificity, conservation, accessibility and functional sites. RESULTS: Pathogenic Protein Kinase mutations perturb essential aspects of protein function, including disruption of substrate binding and/or effector recognition at family-specific positions. Interestingly these mutations in Protein Kinases display a tendency to avoid structurally relevant positions, what represents a significant difference with respect to the average distribution of pathogenic mutations in other protein families. CONCLUSIONS: Disease-associated mutations display sound differences with respect to neutral mutations: several amino acids are specific of each mutation type, different structural properties characterize each class and the distribution of pathogenic mutations within the consensus structure of the Protein Kinase domain is substantially different to that for non-pathogenic mutations. This preferential distribution confirms previous observations about the functional and structural distribution of the controversial cancer driver and passenger somatic mutations and their use as a proxy for the study of the involvement of somatic mutations in cancer development.</text></passage></document><document><id>1698</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A patient with mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency due to the mutations in the HADHB gene showed recurrent myalgia since early childhood and was diagnosed in adolescence.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>182</offset><text>Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) is a multienzyme complex involved in the metabolism of long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA, a product of the fatty acid b-oxidation cycle. MTP is an a4b4 hetero-octomer encoded by two different genes: HADHA (OMIM 600890) and HADHB (OMIM 143450). MTP deficiency induces three different types of presentation: (1) a lethal phenotype with neonatal onset (severe); (2) a hepatic phenotype with infant onset (intermediate); and (3) a neuromyopathic phenotype with late-adolescent onset (mild). While acylcarnitine analysis has revealed increased levels of long-chain hydroxyacylcarnitine in blood when an MTP deficiency exists, the neuromyopathic type is usually asymptomatic and does not always result in an abnormality in acylcarnitine analysis results. We report here the case of a 13-year-old girl with recurrences of intermittent myalgia since her early childhood, for whom the disorder had not been definitely diagnosed. Since she was referred to our hospital because of rhabdomyolysis, we have repeatedly performed blood acylcarnitine analysis and found slight increases in long-chain 3-OH-acylcarnitine levels, on the basis of which we made a chemical diagnosis of MTP deficiency. Immunoblot analysis of skin fibroblasts revealed loss of a- and b-subunits of MTP. In addition, analysis of the HADHB gene, which encodes long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, one of the enzymes constituting MTP, identified compound heterozygous mutations of c.520C>T (p.R141C) and c.1331G>A (p.R411K). MTP deficiency is considered an extremely rare disorder, as only five cases (lethal phenotype, two patients; hepatic phenotype, two patients; and neuromyopathic phenotype, one patient) have thus far been reported in Japan. However, it is likely that the neuromyopathic phenotype of MTP deficiency has not yet been diagnosed among patients with recurrences of intermittent myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, as in our patient reported here.</text></passage></document><document><id>1699</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Feasibility of RNA studies on illegitimate transcription for molecular characterization of splicing mutations in the ATP7B gene: a case report.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>144</offset><text>Approximately 520 Wilson disease-causing mutations in the ATP7B gene have been described to date.

RNA analysis of 1946  +6 T > C in both the peripheral lymphoblasts and liver resulted in the production in the propositus of only an alternative transcript lacking exons 6, 7, and 8 resulting most likely in alterations of cell biochemistry and disease. The patient presents an early form of severe hepatic disease characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, reduced hepatic function, anemia and thrombocytopenia indicating that 1946  +6 T > C is a severe mutation. Since identical results were obtained from both peripheral lymphoblasts and liver they also suggest that RNA studies of illegitimate transcripts can be safely used for molecular characterization of ATP7B splicing mutations, thus improving genetic counseling and diagnosis of Wilson disease.

Patients with PWS share similarities with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Few studies have dealt with growth hormone (GH) treatment in PWS adults. The purpose of the Scandinavian study was to evaluate the effects of GH on body composition, lipid and glucose metabolism, physical performance and safety parameters in adults with PWS. Twenty-five women and 21 men with PWS were randomized to treatment with GH or placebo during 1  year followed by 2  years of open labeled GH treatment. At baseline 1/3 had normal BMI, six patients severe GHD, ten impaired glucose tolerance and seven diabetes. At 1  year insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) SDS had increased by 1.51 (P  &lt;  0.001) and body composition improved in the GH treated group. Visceral fat decreased by 22.9  ml (P  =  0.004), abdominal subcutaneous fat by 70.9  ml (P  =  0.003) and thigh fat by 21.3  ml (P  =  0.013), whereas thigh muscle increased 6.0  ml (P  =  0.005). Lean body mass increased 2.25  kg (P  =  0.005), and total fat mass decreased 4.20  kg (P  &lt;  0.001). The positive effects on body composition were maintained after 2  years of GH treatment. Peak expiratory flow increased by 12% (P  &lt;  0.001) at 2  years of GH treatment. Lipid and glucose metabolism were unchanged, however, three patients developed diabetes at 2  years of GH treatment. In conclusion GH treatment had beneficial effects on the abnormal body composition without serious adverse events making it a logic treatment option in adults with PWS.</text></passage></document><document><id>1702</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a novel mutation of the CPO gene in a Japanese hereditary coproporphyria family. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>Hereditary coproporphyria ( HCP ) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a deficiency of coproporphyrinogen oxidase ( CPO ) caused by a mutation in the CPO gene .

In total, eight BRCA1 alterations (three nonsense mutations and five missense mutations) were identified in this cohort of 144 sporadic breast cancers. We further confirmed that 5 out of 144(3.5%) sporadic breast cancer cases carried a BRCA1 somatic mutation, including two novel nonsense mutations (c.191_212del22 and c.2963C>G) resulting in a truncated protein and three missense mutations (c.114G>T, c.925A>C, and c.824G>A).

Given the clinical importance of establishing their status, a nationwide effort to annotate these UVs was launched by laboratories belonging to the French GGC consortium (Groupe G  n  tique et Cancer), leading to the creation of the UMD-BRCA1/BRCA2 databases (http://www.umd.be/BRCA1/ and http://www.umd.be/BRCA2/). These databases have been endorsed by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) and are designed to collect all variants detected in France, whether causal, neutral or UV. They differ from other BRCA databases in that they contain co-occurrence data for all variants. Using these data, the GGC French consortium has been able to classify certain UVs also contained in other databases.

AOS is caused by mutations in the SMAD3 gene. METHODS: A cohort of 393 patients with aneurysms without mutation in FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 was screened for mutations in SMAD3. The patients originated from The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and USA. The clinical phenotype in a total of 45 patients from eight different AOS families with eight different SMAD3 mutations is described. In all patients with a SMAD3 mutation, clinical records were reviewed and extensive genetic, cardiovascular and orthopaedic examinations were performed. RESULTS: Five novel SMAD3 mutations (one nonsense, two missense and two frame-shift mutations) were identified in five new AOS families. A follow-up description of the three families with a SMAD3 mutation previously described by the authors was included. In the majority of patients, early-onset joint abnormalities, including osteoarthritis and osteochondritis dissecans, were the initial symptom for which medical advice was sought. Cardiovascular abnormalities were present in almost 90% of patients, and involved mainly aortic aneurysms and dissections. Aneurysms and tortuosity were found in the aorta and other arteries throughout the body, including intracranial arteries. Of the patients who first presented with joint abnormalities, 20% died suddenly from aortic dissection. The presence of mild craniofacial abnormalities including hypertelorism and abnormal uvula may aid the recognition of this syndrome. CONCLUSION: The authors provide further insight into the phenotype of AOS with SMAD3 mutations, and present recommendations for a clinical work-up.</text></passage></document><document><id>1708</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Genetic testing in a Chinese pedigree with Lowe syndrome].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To identify the pathogenic mutation underlying Lowe syndrome in a Chinese family. METHODS: After obtaining written informed consent of all participating individuals, peripheral blood samples were collected from 11 family members, including one affected male and three obligate female carriers, and an amniotic fluid sample was obtained from a pregnant carrier female in the family. Genomic DNA was extracted using the standard SDS-proteinase K-phenol/chloroform method. Linkage analysis was carried out using microsatellite markers flanking the OCRL gene. All OCRL exons and their flanking intronic sequences were PCR-amplified and sequenced for the proband. Restriction analysis was performed to confirm the pathogenic mutation. Prenatal genetic testing was carried out by combining haplotype analysis, DNA sequencing and restriction analysis. RESULTS: Linkage analysis showed that the affected male and three obligate carrier females shared a same haplotype. Sequence analysis in the proband revealed a nonsense mutation c.2032C > T (p.R678X) in exon 18 of the OCRL gene. Restriction analysis showed that the mutation was present in the proband and three obligate carriers, but not in the other 7 available family members. This nonsense mutation was not found in the amniotic fluid sample. CONCLUSION: A recurrent OCRL nonsense mutation was found to be the pathogenic mutation in the Chinese family and the fetus didn't carry the mutation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1709</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evaluation of the current disease severity scores in paediatric FMF: is it necessary to develop a new one?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>OBJECTIVES: Modified adult disease severity scoring systems are being used for childhood FMF. We aim to test the clinical consistency of two common severity scoring systems and to evaluate the correlation of scores with the type of FMF mutations in paediatric FMF patients since certain mutations are prone to severe disease. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-eight children with FMF were cross-sectionally studied. Assessment of the disease severity was performed by using the modified scoring systems of Mor et al. and Pras et al. Genetic analysis was performed using PCR and restriction endonuclease digestion methods for the presence of 15 FMF gene mutations. FMF mutations were grouped into three based on well-known genotypic-phenotypic associations. Correlation between the mutation groups and the severity scoring systems was assessed. The consistency of the severity scoring systems was evaluated. RESULTS: The results of two scoring systems were not statistically consistent with each other (k   =   0.171). This inconsistency persisted even in a more homogeneous subgroup of patients with only homozygote mutations of M694V, M680I and M694I (k   =   0.125). There was no correlation between the mutation groups and either of the scoring systems (P   =   0.002, r   =   0,196 for scoring systems of Mor et al.; P   =   0.009, r   =   0.162 for Pras et al.). CONCLUSIONS: The inconsistency of the two scoring systems and lack of correlation between the scoring systems and mutation groups raises concerns about the reliability of these scoring systems in children. There is a need to develop a scoring system in children based on a prospective registry.</text></passage></document><document><id>1710</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Validation of prostate cancer risk-related loci identified from genome-wide association studies using family-based association analysis: evidence from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>218</offset><text>Multiple prostate cancer (PCa) risk-related loci have been discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on case-control designs. However, GWAS findings may be confounded by population stratification if cases and controls are inadvertently drawn from different genetic backgrounds. In addition, since these loci were identified in cases with predominantly sporadic disease, little is known about their relationships with hereditary prostate cancer (HPC). The association between seventeen reported PCa susceptibility loci was evaluated with a family-based association test using 1,979 hereditary PCa families of European descent collected by members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics, with a total of 5,730 affected men. The risk alleles for 8 of the 17 loci were significantly over-transmitted from parents to affected offspring, including SNPs residing in 8q24 (regions 1, 2 and 3), 10q11, 11q13, 17q12 (region 1), 17q24 and Xp11. In subgroup analyses, three loci, at 8q24 (regions 1 and 2) plus 17q12, were significantly over-transmitted in hereditary PCa families with five or more affected members, while loci at 3p12, 8q24 (region 2), 11q13, 17q12 (region 1), 17q24 and Xp11 were significantly over-transmitted in HPC families with an average age of diagnosis at 65  years or less.

Analysis of 17 rare alleles revealed a stratification of allele fragment size and upstream haplotype in which each rare VTR allele possessed the markers characteristic of the common allele nearest in size. Therefore, hyperallelism emanated from the four common alleles in a defined fashion, the size of a rare allele specifying its origin.

We performed SNP array-based homozygosity mapping and found a single large continuous segment of homozygosity on chromosomal region 12q13.12. The candidate region contained 35 genes that are listed in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and 27 other genes. We performed candidate gene sequencing and screened both clinically affected individuals (children and adults with hypertriglyceridemia) and also a healthy cohort for mutations in GPD1, which encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1. Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous splicing mutation, c.361-1G>C, which resulted in an aberrantly spliced mRNA in the ten affected individuals. This mutation is predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking essential conserved residues, including a functional site responsible for initial substrate recognition. Functional consequences of the mutation were evaluated by measuring intracellular concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride as well as triglyceride secretion in HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) human cells lines overexpressing normal and mutant GPD1 cDNA. Overexpression of mutant GPD1 in HepG2 cells, in comparison to overexpression of wild-type GPD1, resulted in increased secretion of triglycerides (p = 0.01).

Due to their clinical and genetic heterogeneity, these diseases are difficult to diagnose. We have developed a targeted exome sequencing approach to improve our ability to properly diagnose mitochondrial diseases and apply it here to an individual patient. Our method targets mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the exons of 1,600 nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biology or Mendelian disorders with multi-system phenotypes, thereby allowing for simultaneous evaluation of multiple disease loci. CASE PRESENTATION: Targeted exome sequencing was performed on a patient initially suspected to have a mitochondrial disorder. The patient presented with diabetes mellitus, diffuse brain atrophy, autonomic neuropathy, optic nerve atrophy, and a severe amnestic syndrome. Further work-up revealed multiple heteroplasmic mtDNA deletions as well as profound thiamine deficiency without a clear nutritional cause. Targeted exome sequencing revealed a homozygous c.1672C > T (p.R558C) missense mutation in exon 8 of WFS1 that has previously been reported in a patient with Wolfram syndrome. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates how clinical application of next-generation sequencing technology can enhance the diagnosis of patients suspected to have rare genetic disorders. Furthermore, the finding of unexplained thiamine deficiency in a patient with Wolfram syndrome suggests a potential link between WFS1 biology and thiamine metabolism that has implications for the clinical management of Wolfram syndrome patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1716</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Effect of ambiguous hemochromatosis gene test results on physician utilization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Genetic test results may be available to greater numbers of people through genetic screening projects and other means. The effects of widespread genetic testing and notification of genetic test results, particularly added costs through increased physician utilization, have not been clearly established. METHODS: A primary care-based cohort of 20,306 participants (Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Study, Ontario site) were tested for the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene and for abnormal serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation levels. The primary outcome variable was the total number of physician claims per patient after genetic test notification by mail. Multiple Poisson regression was used to adjust for age, sex, baseline SF, diagnoses of arthritis, diabetes, heart failure and impotence, self-rated health, and the number of claims during the 12 months before notification of results. The reference group had no HFE mutations (wild type) and normal transferrin saturation/SF values. RESULTS: Participants with an ambiguous hemochromatosis gene test and normal iron levels had statistically significantly higher average physician utilization of 3.0%. Participants with HFE mutations (excluding C282Y homozygotes) and elevated iron values showed a 6% increase in physician utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The health effects, if any, of increased utilization in heterozygotes or those with mild ferritin elevations are unknown but are unlikely to be large at the population level. Ambiguous genetic test results are associated with increased physician service use and should be considered when assessing the complete societal costs of widespread genetic testing.</text></passage></document><document><id>1717</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Sialophorin (CD43) and the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>53</offset><text>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an inherited deficiency of T-lymphocyte function and of platelets. The observation in 1981-84 of deficiency and/or defects in Wiskott-Aldrich lymphocytes of the surface molecule sialophorin (CD43) spurred intensive study of this molecule. Sialophorin (CD43) is now known to be a prevalent molecule on most circulating blood cells; it is a transmembrane molecule subject to phosphorylation reactions and capable of intracellular signaling. Oligosaccharides constitute 60% of the molecule. The extracellular region resembles acidic mucin molecules with expanded structure and dense negative charge. The sialophorin (CD43) polypeptide is subject to alternative glycosylation pathways that are cell-specific. CD43 functions in vitro as the receptor of an independent pathway of T-lymphocyte and monocyte activation. CD43 is hypothesized to regulate the survival of blood cells in the circulation.

Our goal was to examine differences in the brain structure phenotype of common subtypes of PWS [chromosome 15q deletions and maternal uniparental disomy 15 (UPD)]. Fifteen individuals with PWS due to a typical deletion [(DEL) type I; n = 5, type II; n = 10], eight with PWS due to UPD, and 25 age-matched healthy-weight individuals (HWC) participated in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. A custom voxel-based morphometry processing stream was used to examine regional differences in gray and white matter volume (WMV) between groups, covarying for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Overall, compared to HWC, PWS individuals had lower gray matter volumes (GMV) that encompassed the prefrontal, orbitofrontal and temporal cortices, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and lower WMVs in the brain stem, cerebellum, medial temporal, and frontal cortex. Compared to UPD, the DEL subtypes had lower GMV primarily in the prefrontal and temporal cortices, and lower white matter in the parietal cortex. The UPD subtype had more extensive lower gray and WMVs in the orbitofrontal and limbic cortices compared to HWC.

The RS1 gene (MIM 300839) associated with the disease encodes retinoschisin, a 224 amino acid protein containing a discoidin domain as the major structural unit, an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence, and regions responsible for subunit oligomerization. Retinoschisin is secreted from retinal cells as a disulphide-linked homo-octameric complex which binds to the surface of photoreceptors and bipolar cells to help maintain the integrity of the retina. Over 190 disease-causing mutations in the RS1 gene are known with most mutations occurring as non-synonymous changes in the discoidin domain. Cell expression studies have shown that disease-associated missense mutations in the discoidin domain cause severe protein misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, mutations in the signal sequence result in aberrant protein synthesis, and mutations in regions flanking the discoidin domain cause defective disulphide-linked subunit assembly, all of which produce a non-functional protein. Knockout mice deficient in retinoschisin have been generated and shown to display most of the characteristic features found in XLRS patients. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) mediated delivery of the normal RS1 gene to the retina of young knockout mice result in long-term retinoschisin expression and rescue of retinal structure and function providing a 'proof of concept' that gene therapy may be an effective treatment for XLRS.</text></passage></document><document><id>1723</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>CD1 gene polymorphisms and phenotypic variability in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is characterized by marked phenotypic variation ranging from adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) to childhood cerebral ALD (CCALD). X-ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, but no genotype-phenotype correlation has been established so far and modifier gene variants are suspected to modulate phenotypes. Specific classes of lipids, enriched in very long-chain fatty acids that accumulate in plasma and tissues from X-ALD patients are suspected to be involved in the neuroinflammatory process of CCALD. CD1 proteins are lipid- antigen presenting molecules encoded by five CD1 genes in human (CD1A-E). Association studies with 23 tag SNPs covering the CD1 locus was performed in 52 patients with AMN and 87 patients with CCALD. The minor allele of rs973742 located 4-kb downstream from CD1D was significantly more frequent in AMN patients (    =7.6; P=0.006). However, this association was no longer significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The other polymorphisms of the CD1 locus did not reveal significant association. Further analysis of other CD1D polymorphisms did not detect stronger association with X-ALD phenotypes. Although the association with rs973742 warrants further investigations, these results indicate that the genetic variants of CD1 genes do not contribute markedly to the phenotypic variance of X-ALD.</text></passage></document><document><id>1724</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Long-term rescue of retinal structure and function by rhodopsin RNA replacement with a single adeno-associated viral vector in P23H RHO transgenic mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>153</offset><text>Many mutations in the human rhodopsin gene (RHO) cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). Our previous studies with a P23H (proline-23 substituted by histidine) RHO transgenic mouse model of ADRP demonstrated significant improvement of retinal function and preservation of retinal structure after transfer of wild-type rhodopsin by AAV. In this study we demonstrate long-term rescue of retinal structure and function by a single virus expressing both RHO replacement cDNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) to digest mouse Rho and human P23H RHO mRNA. This combination should prevent overexpression of rhodopsin, which can be deleterious to photoreceptors. On the basis of the electroretinogram (ERG) response, degeneration of retinal function was arrested at 2 months postinjection, and the response was maintained at this level until termination at 9 months. Preservation of the ERG response in P23H RHO mice reflected survival of photoreceptors: both the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and outer segments of photoreceptor cells maintained the same thickness as in nontransgenic mice, whereas the control injected P23H eyes exhibited severe thinning of the ONL and outer segments. These findings suggest that delivery of both a modified cDNA and an siRNA by a single adeno-associated viral vector provided long-term rescue of ADRP in this model. Because the siRNA targets human as well as mouse rhodopsin mRNAs, the combination vector may be useful for the treatment of human disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1725</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Gaucher disease and the synucleinopathies: refining the relationship.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>Gaucher disease (OMIM 230800, 230900, 231000), the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is due to a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Gaucher patients display a wide spectrum of clinical presentation, with hepatosplenomegaly, haematological changes, and orthopaedic complications being the predominant symptoms. Gaucher disease is classified into three broad phenotypes based upon the presence or absence of neurological involvement: Type 1 (non-neuronopathic), Type 2 (acute neuronopathic), and Type 3 (subacute neuronopathic). Nearly 300 mutations have been identified in Gaucher patients, with the majority being missense mutations. Though studies of genotype-to-phenotype correlations have revealed significant heterogeneity, some consistent patterns have emerged to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions. Recent research has highlighted a potential role for Gaucher disease in other comorbidities such as cancer and Parkinson's Disease. In this review, we will examine the potential relationship between Gaucher disease and the synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the development of intracellular aggregates of a-synuclein.

Like the human Bf gene, murine Bf and C2 each consist of 18 exons with similar intron-exon organizations. The murine C2 gene (20 kilobases) is more than three times the size of Bf (6 kilobases) due to the presence of large intronic segments separating the exons encoding the NH2-terminal binding and central (von Willebrand factor) domains. Evidence from cDNA clones shows that the two C2 transcripts are generated by an alternative splice at the donor site of exon 14 producing long and short C2 mRNA species that differ by 21 base pairs encoding a region within the binding pocket (amino acids 636-642 (GSTCKDH)) of the serine proteinase domain. Tissue-specific multiple factor B transcripts are generated by alternative transcriptional initiation. From the structure of these transcripts the predicted regulation of expression and rates of translation of B programmed by the short and long mRNA species may differ, but the polypeptides are identical. These data indicate that different molecular mechanisms account for the multiple forms of C2 and factor B mRNA and that the structure of the different transcripts predicts differences in function and expression of the respective gene products.</text></passage></document><document><id>1727</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Detection of a rare CDKN2A intronic mutation in a Hungarian melanoma-prone family and its role in splicing regulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>BACKGROUND: The major locus for melanoma predisposition is the cell cycle regulatory CDKN2A gene on chromosome 9p21. However, the frequency of germline coding mutations of the CDKN2A gene is lower than expected in melanoma-prone families linked to chromosome 9p21. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the rare IVS1+37 G/C intronic mutation of the CDKN2A gene, recently identified in a Hungarian melanoma-prone family, influences mRNA splicing regulation. METHODS: CDKN2A minigenes containing the wild-type and the mutant intronic sequence were created and transfected into HeLa cells with the aim of studying the mRNA transcripts. RESULTS: The results revealed the emergence of a differential splicing pattern from the wild-type and the mutant minigene, suggesting that this mutation may alter the splicing of CDKN2A primary mRNA and therefore might have a pathogenetic role in familial melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that these results confirm the importance of the identification and characterization of CDKN2A intronic mutations with a view to improving our understanding of the pathogenesis, and explain why the frequency of germline coding mutations of the CDKN2A gene is lower than expected in melanoma-prone families linked to chromosome 9p21.</text></passage></document><document><id>1728</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mice lacking the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase develop a late onset progressive myopathy. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3 untranslated region of a putative protein kinase ( DMPK ) .

METHODS: Modifier loci were identified by genetic quantitative trait locus analysis. F2 Tulp1(tm1Pjn/tm1Pjn) mutant mice from a B6-Tulp1(tm1Pjn/tm1Pjn)   AKR/J intercross were genotyped with a panel of single nucleotide polymorphism markers and phenotyped by histology for photoreceptor nuclei remaining at 9 weeks of age. Genotype and phenotype data were correlated and examined with Pseudomarker 2.02 using 128 imputations to map modifier loci. Thresholds for the 63%, 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels were obtained from 100 permutations. A significant, protective candidate modifier was identified by bioinformatic analysis and confirmed by crossing transgenic mice bearing a protective allele of this gene with Tulp1- and Tub-deficient mice. RESULTS: A significant, protective modifier locus on chromosome 2 and a suggestive locus on chromosome 13 that increases photoreceptor loss were identified in a B6-Tulp1(tm1Pjn/tm1Pjn)   AKR/J intercross. The chromosome 2 locus mapped near Mtap1a, which encodes a protein associated with microtubule-based intracellular transport and synapse function. The protective Mtap1a(129P2/OlaHsd) allele was shown to reduce photoreceptor loss in both Tulp1(tm1Pjn/tm1Pjn) and Tub(tub/tub) mice. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that the gene Mtap1a, which modifies hearing loss in Tub(tub/tub) mice, also modifies retinal degeneration in Tub(tub/tub) and Tulp1(tm1Pjn/tm1Pjn) mice. These results suggest that functionally nonredundant members of the TULP family (TUB and TULP1) share a common functional interaction with MTAP1A.</text></passage></document><document><id>1731</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Wsp1 is downstream of Cin1 and regulates vesicle transport and actin cytoskeleton as an effector of Cdc42 and Rac1 in Cryptococcus neoformans.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>143</offset><text>Human Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is a scaffold linking upstream signals to the actin cytoskeleton. In response to intersectin ITSN1 and Rho GTPase Cdc42, WASP activates the Arp2/3 complex to promote actin polymerization. The human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans contains the ITSN1 homolog Cin1 and the WASP homolog Wsp1, which share more homology with human proteins than those of other fungi. Here we demonstrate that Cin1, Cdc42/Rac1, and Wsp1 function in an effector pathway similar to that of mammalian models. In the cin1 mutant, expression of the autoactivated Wsp1-B-GBD allele partially suppressed the mutant defect in endocytosis, and expression of the constitutively active CDC42(Q61L) allele restored normal actin cytoskeleton structures. Similar phenotypic suppression can be obtained by the expression of a Cdc42-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Wsp1 fusion protein. In addition, Rac1, which was found to exhibit a role in early endocytosis, activates Wsp1 to regulate vacuole fusion. Rac1 interacted with Wsp1 and depended on Wsp1 for its vacuolar membrane localization. Expression of the Wsp1-B-GBD allele restored vacuolar membrane fusion in the rac1 mutant. Collectively, our studies suggest novel ways in which this pathogenic fungus has adapted conserved signaling pathways to control vesicle transport and actin organization, likely benefiting survival within infected hosts.</text></passage></document><document><id>1732</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Gonosomal mosaicism for an NF1 deletion in a sperm donor: evidence of the need for coordinated, long-term communication of health information among relevant parties.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>166</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Screening of gamete donors can reduce but cannot eliminate the risks for medical problems in donor-conceived offspring.

METHODS: A repeat physical evaluation and ophthalmology examination were performed on the donor. DNA samples were examined by RTPCR fragment analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and targeted array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).

In the present study, we report that rationally designed, modularly assembled small molecules that bind the RNA that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) are potently bioactive in cell culture models. DM1 is caused when an expansion of r(CUG) repeats, or r(CUG)(exp), is present in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) mRNA. r(CUG)(exp) folds into a hairpin with regularly repeating 5'CUG/3'GUC motifs and sequesters muscleblind-like 1 protein (MBNL1). A variety of defects are associated with DM1, including (i) formation of nuclear foci, (ii) decreased translation of DMPK mRNA due to its nuclear retention, and (iii) pre-mRNA splicing defects due to inactivation of MBNL1, which controls the alternative splicing of various pre-mRNAs. Previously, modularly assembled ligands targeting r(CUG)(exp) were designed using information in an RNA motif-ligand database. These studies showed that a bis-benzimidazole (H) binds the 5'CUG/3'GUC motif in r(CUG)(exp.) Therefore, we designed multivalent ligands to bind simultaneously multiple copies of this motif in r(CUG)(exp). Herein, we report that the designed compounds improve DM1-associated defects including improvement of translational and pre-mRNA splicing defects and the disruption of nuclear foci. These studies may establish a foundation to exploit other RNA targets in genomic sequence.</text></passage></document><document><id>1734</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation analysis of alpha-galactosidase a gene in Hungarian Fabry patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>AIM was to detect the mutations of alpha-galactosidase A gene in two Hungarian Fabry patients.

HDL2 is caused by a CTG/CAG repeat expansion. In the CTG orientation, the repeat is located within the alternatively spliced exon 2A of junctophilin-3 (JPH3), potentially encoding polyleucine and polyalanine, whereas on the strand antisense to JPH3, the repeat is in frame to encode polyglutamine. The JPH3 protein product serves to stabilize junctional membrane complexes and regulate neuronal calcium flux. We have previously demonstrated the potential pathogenic properties of JPH3 transcripts containing expanded CUG repeats. The aim of this study was to test the possibility that loss of JPH3 expression or expanded amino acid tracts also contribute to HDL2 pathogenesis. METHODS: Transcripts from the HDL2 locus, and their protein products, were examined in HDL2, HD, and control frontal cortex. The effect of loss of Jph3 was examined in mice with partial or complete loss of Jph3. RESULTS: Bidirectional transcription occurs at the HDL2 locus, although expression of antisense transcripts with expanded CAG repeats is limited. Protein products with expanded amino acid tracts were not detected in HDL2 brain. However, JPH3 transcripts and full-length JPH3 protein are decreased in HDL2 brain, and Jph3 hemizygous and null mice exhibit abnormal motor function. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the pathogenic mechanism of HDL2 is multifactorial, involving both a toxic gain of function of JPH3 RNA and a toxic loss of JPH3 expression.</text></passage></document><document><id>1738</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evaluating the evidence for transmission distortion in human pedigrees.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>Children of a heterozygous parent are expected to carry either allele with equal probability. Exceptions can occur, however, due to meiotic drive, competition among gametes, or viability selection, which we collectively term "transmission distortion" (TD). Although there are several well-characterized examples of these phenomena, their existence in humans remains unknown. We therefore performed a genome-wide scan for TD by applying the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) genome-wide to three large sets of human pedigrees of European descent: the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a founder population of European origin (HUTT), and a subset of the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE). Genotyping error is an important confounder in this type of analysis. In FHS and HUTT, despite extensive quality control, we did not find sufficient evidence to exclude genotyping error in the strongest signals. In AGRE, however, many signals extended across multiple SNPs, a pattern highly unlikely to arise from genotyping error. We identified several candidate regions in this data set, notably a locus in 10q26.13 displaying a genome-wide significant TDT in combined female and male transmissions and a signature of recent positive selection, as well as a paternal TD signal in 6p21.1, the same region in which a significant TD signal was previously observed in 30 European males. Neither region replicated in FHS, however, and the paternal signal was not visible in sperm competition assays or as allelic imbalance in sperm. In maternal transmissions, we detected no strong signals near centromeres or telomeres, the regions predicted to be most susceptible to female-specific meiotic drive, but we found a significant enrichment of top signals among genes involved in cell junctions. These results illustrate both the potential benefits and the challenges of using the TDT to study transmission distortion and provide candidates for investigation in future studies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1739</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Long-term correction of very long-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase deficiency in mice using AAV9 gene therapy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Very long-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is the rate-limiting step in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.

Disease-specific phenotypes were characterized, including thermoregulation and maintenance of euglycemia after a fasting cold challenge. Internal body temperatures of untreated VLCAD(-/-) mice dropped below 20   C and the mice became lethargic, requiring euthanasia.

The critical region for CES is currently estimated to be about 2.1   Mb and to contain at least 14 RefSeq genes. Gain of this region may cause ocular coloboma, preauricular, anorectal, urogenital and congenital heart malformations. We describe a family in which a 600   kb intrachromosomal triplication is present in at least three generations. The copy number alteration was detected using MLPA and further characterized with interphase and metaphase FISH and SNP-array. The amplified fragment is located in the distal part of the CES region. The family members show anal atresia and preauricular tags or pits, matching part of the phenotype of this syndrome. This finding suggests that amplification of the genes CECR2, SLC25A18 and ATP6V1E1, mapping within the critical region for CES, may be responsible for anorectal, renal and preauricular anomalies in patients with CES.</text></passage></document><document><id>1741</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of deletions in the dystrophin gene giving mild phenotypes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>We have characterized deletions of the dystrophin gene in patients suffering from relatively mild muscular dystrophy.

Three brothers suffering from BMD, glycerol kinase deficiency, and adrenal hypoplasia possess a deletion at the 3' end of the gene. They also display developmental delay.

It is characterized by overproduction of uric acid, jointly with severe motor disability and self-injurious behaviour which physiopathology is unknown. These neurological manifestations suggest a dysfunction in the basal ganglia, and three neurotransmitters have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease: dopamine, adenosine and serotonin. All of them are implicated in motor function and behaviour, and act by binding to specific G-protein coupled receptors in the synaptic membrane where they seem to be integrated through receptor-receptor interactions. In this work we have confirmed at protein level the previously reported increased expression of DRD5 and the variably aberrant expression of ADORA2A, in LND PBL respect to control PBL. We have also described, for the first time, a decreased expression and protein level of 5-HTR1A in LND PBL respect to control PBL. If these results were confirmed in the Lesch-Nyhan patients basal ganglia cells, this would support the hypothesis that pathogenesis of neurological manifestations of Lesch-Nyhan patients may be related to an imbalance of neurotransmitters, rather than to the isolated disturbance of one of the neurotransmitters, and this fact should be taken into account in the design of pharmacologic treatment for their motor and behavioural disturbances.</text></passage></document><document><id>1743</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Reticulated pigmentary changes in a patient with a variant form of Lesch-Nyhan disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset></passage></document><document><id>1744</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Detection of genomic variations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes by long-range PCR and next-generation sequencing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Advances in sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), represent an opportunity to perform genetic testing in a clinical scenario.

Eleven LR-PCR fragments, between 3000 and 15,300 bp, containing all coding exons and flanking splice junctions of BRCA1 and BRCA2, were obtained from DNA samples of five individuals carrying mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2. Libraries for NGS were prepared using an enzymatic (Nextera technology) method. We analyzed five individual samples in parallel by NGS and obtained complete coverage of all LR-PCR fragments, with an average coding sequence depth for each nucleotide of >30 reads, running from  7 (in exon 22 of BRCA1) to > 150. We detected and confirmed 100% of the mutations that predispose to the risk of cancer, together with other genomic variations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Our approach demonstrates that genomic LR-PCR, together with NGS, using the GS Junior 454 System platform, is an effective method for patient sample analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. In addition, this method could be performed in regular molecular genetics laboratories.</text></passage></document><document><id>1745</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations affecting components of the SWI/SNF complex cause Coffin-Siris syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>By exome sequencing, we found de novo SMARCB1 mutations in two of five individuals with typical Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), a rare autosomal dominant anomaly syndrome.

Thus, about 15% of VWS cases are indistinguishable from cases with non-syndromic oral clefts. IRF6 mutations are the major cause of VWS; however, variants in this gene show strong association with non-syndromic oral clefts, with a higher increased risk among cases with cleft lip only (CLO). A total of 39 individuals, including 16 patients with CLO and 23 patients with a family history of cleft, were examined for IRF6 mutations in the present study. Seven variants, including five known (c.-75-4 A>; G, c.-73T>; C, c.459G>; T 5, c.820G>; A, and c.1060  +  37C>; T) and two novel (c.-75-23G>; C and c.1380G>; T), were found. Both novel variants were inherited from non-affected parents and we did not find also in the 120 control chromosomes. In silico analysis revealed that both c.1380G>; T and c.-75-23G>; C variants may disrupts a putative exonic splicing enhancer and intronic splicing binding site for SC35, respectively. Taken together, the presence of deleterious IRF6 variants in patients with non-syndromic oral clefts could be most likely an evidence for VWS. While, IRF6 variants could, at best, contribute to clefting as part of a complex inheritance pattern, with both additional genes and environmental factors having a role.</text></passage></document><document><id>1747</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Living situation, occupation and health-related quality of life in adult patients with classic galactosemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>109</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency is well known as the underlying defect in classic galactosemia. However, little is known about the consequences of this defect beyond physical disease. AIM: To evaluate psychosocial, educational and occupational outcome as well as health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adult German patients with galactosemia and to compare information with data from patients with phenylketonuria as well as the general German population. METHODS: Members of the German patient support group for galactosemia received invitation, informed consent form and questionnaires by regular mail from the patient support group. Participation was voluntary. RESULTS: Forty-one out of 66 invited patients participated in this study. Nearly 2/3 of the patients were singles, and the majority of patients were still living with their parents. Frequently, patients had no school leaving certificate, and 30% of the patients had never started or never completed an apprenticeship. Getting along with galactosemia was rated as 'very good' or 'good' although following the diet was a burden. Social well-being and social functioning was lower compared to patients with PKU. DISCUSSION: Patients with galactosemia need a multi-professional team not only focusing on physical and/or biochemical aspects of disease but including also psycho-social dimensions of life.</text></passage></document><document><id>1748</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Truncation mutations in the transactivation region of PAX6 result in dominant-negative mutants. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>PAX6 is a transcription factor with two DNA-binding domains ( paired box and homeobox ) and a proline-serine-threonine ( PST ) -rich transactivation domain .

Heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene result in various phenotypes , including aniridia , Peters anomaly , autosomal dominant keratitis , and familial foveal dysplasia . It is believed that the mutated allele of PAX6 produces an inactive protein and aniridia is caused due to genetic haploinsufficiency . However , several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the C-terminal half of PAX6 in patients with Aniridia resulting in mutant proteins that retain the DNA-binding domains but have lost most of the transactivation domain . It is not clear whether such mutants really behave as loss-of-function mutants as predicted by haploinsufficiency . Contrary to this theory , our data showed that these mutants are dominant-negative in transient transfection assays when they are coexpressed with wild-type PAX6 . We found that the dominant-negative effects result from the enhanced DNA binding ability of these mutants . Kinetic studies of binding and dissociation revealed that various truncation mutants have 3-5-fold higher affinity to various DNA-binding sites when compared with the wild-type PAX6 .

Sequence variants of CETP, LIPC, and LIPG were identified by sequencing exons and exon-intron junctions in 64 subjects with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels >= 2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) and compared to those of 113 normolipidemic subjects. Two heterozygous frameshift mutations in CETP (p.Leu262ProfsX31 and p.Val411ArgfsX6) and two heterozygous missense mutations in LIPC (p.Gly141Ser and p.Val173Met) were found. One deletion mutation and 3 point mutations in the CETP promoter were also identified. Collectively, these rare mutations were found only in the HALP group but not in the control group (8% vs 0%, p = 0.0056). One common variant of CETP (p.Asp459Gly) was found at a higher frequency in the HALP group (23% vs 4%, p = 0.000074). Altogether, rare variants of CETP or LIPC and/or the common CETP p.Asp459Gly variant were found in 30% of the HALP group and 4% of the controls (p = 0.0000014). No rare variant of LIPG was identified. In conclusion, common and rare genetic variants in CETP and LIPC, but not LIPG, were more commonly found in the Thai HALP group, which could potentially contribute to high high-density lipoprotein cholesterol phenotypes in this population.</text></passage></document><document><id>1754</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>E-cadherin destabilization accounts for the pathogenicity of missense mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>E-cadherin is critical for the maintenance of tissue architecture due to its role in cell-cell adhesion. E-cadherin mutations are the genetic cause of Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) and missense mutations represent a clinical burden, due to the uncertainty of their pathogenic role. In vitro and in vivo, most mutations lead to loss-of-function, although the causal factor is unknown for the majority. We hypothesized that destabilization could account for the pathogenicity of E-cadherin missense mutations in HDGC, and tested our hypothesis using in silico and in vitro tools. FoldX algorithm was used to calculate the impact of each mutation in E-cadherin native-state stability, and the analysis was complemented with evolutionary conservation, by SIFT. Interestingly, HDGC patients harbouring germline E-cadherin destabilizing mutants present a younger age at diagnosis or death, suggesting that the loss of native-state stability of E-cadherin accounts for the disease phenotype. To elucidate the biological relevance of E-cadherin destabilization in HDGC, we investigated a group of newly identified HDGC-associated mutations (E185V, S232C and L583R), of which L583R is predicted to be destabilizing. We show that this mutation is not functional in vitro, exhibits shorter half-life and is unable to mature, due to premature proteasome-dependent degradation, a phenotype reverted by stabilization with the artificial mutation L583I (structurally tolerated). Herein we report E-cadherin structural models suitable to predict the impact of the majority of cancer-associated missense mutations and we show that E-cadherin destabilization leads to loss-of-function in vitro and increased pathogenicity in vivo.</text></passage></document><document><id>1755</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Medium-sized deletion in the BRCA1 gene: Limitations of Sanger sequencing and MLPA analyses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset><text>We describe a family with a history of breast and ovarian cancer in which MLPA analysis of the BRCA1 gene pointed to a deletion including a part of exon 11.

Because this alteration was only detected serendipitously with an MLPA probe, we calculated the probabilities of detecting medium-sized deletions in large exons by methods including initial PCR amplification. This showed that a considerable fraction of medium-sized deletions are undetectable by currently used standard methods of mutation analyses.

In this study, a 9-year-old male patient manifesting severe developmental delay and spasticity was analyzed for PLP1 alteration, and triplication of PLP1 was identified. Further examination revealed an underlying genomic organization, duplication-inverted triplication-duplication (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP), in which a triplicated segment was nested between 2 junctions. One of the 2 junctions was caused by inverted homologous regions, and the other was caused by non-homologous end-joining. PMD patients with PLP1 duplications usually show milder-classical forms of the disease compared with patients with PLP1 missense mutations manifesting severe connatal forms. The present patient showed severe phenotypic features that represent an intermediate form of PMD between classical and connatal forms. This is the first report of a patient with PLP1 triplication caused by a DUP-TRP/INV-DUP structure.

FS is a genetically heterogeneous condition. Thus far, mutations in FRAS1 and FREM2 have been identified as cause of FS. Both FRAS1 and FREM2 encode extracellular matrix proteins that are essential for the adhesion between epidermal basement membrane and the underlying dermal connective tissues during embryonic development. Mutations in murine Grip1, which encodes a scaffolding protein that interacts with Fras1/Frem proteins, result in FS-like defects in mice. OBJECTIVE: To test GRIP1 for genetic variants in FS families that do not have mutations in FRAS1 and FREM2. METHODS AND RESULTS: In three unrelated families with parental consanguinity, GRIP1 mutations were found to segregate with the disease in an autosomal recessive manner (donor splice site mutation NM_021150.3:c.2113+1G > C in two families and a 4-bp deletion, NM_021150.3:c.1181_1184del in the third). RT-PCR analysis of the GRIP1 mRNA showed that the c.2113+1G > C splice mutation causes skipping of exon 17, leading to a frame shift and a premature stop of translation.

To further understand the functional outcome of selected missense mutations (p.Trp164Arg, p.Ile197Arg and p.Gly845Ser, and the previously reported p.Gly190Ser) we characterized the biophysical properties of mutant ion channels in tsA cell model. In the physiological range of muscle membrane potential, all the tested mutations, except p.Gly845Ser, reduced the open probability, increased the fast and slow components of deactivation and affected pore properties. This suggests a decrease in macroscopic chloride currents impairing membrane potential repolarization and causing hyperexcitability in muscle membranes. Detailed clinical features are given of the 8 patients characterized by cell electrophysiology. These data expand the spectrum of CLCN1 mutations and may contribute to genotype-phenotype correlations.

To answer these questions, a total of 58 colorectal tumors have been examined; in each tumor, allelic losses were assessed using restriction fragment length polymorphisms and p53 gene mutations were assessed by sequencing cloned polymerase chain reaction products. The following conclusions emerged: (a) p53 gene mutations occurred but were relatively rare in adenomas, regardless of size and whether the adenomas were derived from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis; (b) In carcinomas as well as in adenomas, p53 gene mutations were infrequently observed in tumors which contain both copies of chromosome 17p (17% of 30 tumors), while tumors which lost one copy of chromosome 17p usually had a mutation in the remaining p53 allele (86% of 28 tumors); (c) p53 gene mutations were found at similar frequencies in primary tumor samples and in cell lines derived from tumors. These and other data suggest that the rate limiting step in p53 inactivation is point mutation and that once a mutation occurs, loss of the remaining wild-type allele rapidly follows. Both mutations and allelic losses generally occur near the transition from benign to malignant growth, and the p53 gene may play a causal role in this progression.</text></passage></document><document><id>1765</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The relevance of the non-canonical PTS1 of peroxisomal catalase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>Catalase is sorted to peroxisomes via a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1), which binds to the receptor protein Pex5. Analysis of the C-terminal sequences of peroxisomal catalases from various species indicated that catalase never contains the typical C-terminal PTS1 tripeptide-SKL, but invariably is sorted to peroxisomes via a non-canonical sorting sequence. We analyzed the relevance of the non-canonical PTS1 of catalase of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha (-SKI). Using isothermal titration microcalorimetry, we show that the affinity of H. polymorpha Pex5 for a peptide containing -SKI at the C-terminus is 8-fold lower relative to a peptide that has a C-terminal -SKL. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that green fluorescent protein containing the -SKI tripeptide (GFP-SKI) has a prolonged residence time in the cytosol compared to GFP containing -SKL. Replacing the -SKI sequence of catalase into -SKL resulted in reduced levels of enzymatically active catalase in whole cell lysates together with the occurrence of catalase protein aggregates in the peroxisomal matrix. Moreover, the cultures showed a reduced growth yield in methanol-limited chemostats. Finally, we show that a mutant catalase variant that is unable to properly fold mislocalizes in protein aggregates in the cytosol. However, by replacing the PTS1 into -SKL the mutant variant accumulates in protein aggregates inside peroxisomes. Based on our findings we propose that the relatively weak PTS1 of catalase is important to allow proper folding of the enzyme prior to import into peroxisomes, thereby preventing the accumulation of catalase protein aggregates in the organelle matrix.</text></passage></document><document><id>1766</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Some important aspects of mutra pariksha- from basava rajiyam.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset></passage></document><document><id>1767</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Dysspondyloenchondromatosis: Another COL2A1-Related Skeletal Dysplasia?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>Dysspondyloenchondromatosis (DSC) is a rare skeletal dysplasia that has currently been classified into the group of spondylometaphyseal dysplasias. To date, only 12 affected individuals have been reported. All cases are sporadic, and the etiology remains unknown. Distinctive features of DSC are anisospondyly and enchondroma-like lesions in the metaphyseal and diaphyseal portions of the long tubular bones. Affected individuals usually develop kyphoscoliosis and asymmetric limb shortening at an early age. Interestingly, some of the skeletal changes overlap with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) Strudwick type, a rare type II collagen disorder. Based on this resemblance we postulated that DSC may be allelic to SEMD Strudwick type and therefore performed a COL2A1 analysis in an affected boy who was diagnosed as having DSC at the age of 3 years. The identification of a novel heterozygous COL2A1 missense mutation (p.Gly753Asp) in the proband confirms our hypothesis and suggests that DSC may be another type II collagen disorder.</text></passage></document><document><id>1768</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Recurrent and founder mutations in the PMS2 gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>50</offset><text>Germline mutations in PMS2 are associated with Lynch syndrome (LS), the most common known cause of hereditary colorectal cancer. Mutation detection in PMS2 has been difficult due to the presence of several pseudogenes, but a custom-designed long-range PCR strategy now allows adequate mutation detection. Many mutations are unique. However, some mutations are observed repeatedly across individuals not known to be related due to the mutation being either recurrent, arising multiple times de novo at hot spots for mutations, or of founder origin, having occurred once in an ancestor. Previously, we observed 36 distinct mutations in a sample of 61 independently ascertained Caucasian probands of mixed European background with PMS2 mutations. Eleven of these mutations were detected in more than one individual not known to be related and of these, six were detected more than twice. These six mutations accounted for 31 (51%) ostensibly unrelated probands. Here, we performed genotyping and haplotype analysis in four mutations observed in multiple probands and found two (c.137G>T and exon 10 deletion) to be founder mutations and one (c.903G>T) a probable founder. One (c.1A>G) could not be evaluated for founder mutation status. We discuss possible explanations for the frequent occurrence of founder mutations in PMS2.</text></passage></document><document><id>1769</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Schwartz-Jampel syndrome: a review of the literature and case report.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) is a rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia associated with myotonia.

The use of general anesthesia in patients with SJS is dangerous, as there is a risk of malignant hyperthermia. The purpose of this paper is to describe a 3-year-old Chinese boy diagnosed with SJS at birth. His intra-oral examination revealed significant dental findings such as dentin defects with generalized attrition and hypodontia of the permanent dentition.

Deletions or missense mutations of the TNFRSN11B gene are common in these children. This gene encodes a soluble protein, the osteoprotegerin, which leads to uncontrolled osteoclastogenesis when mutated. JPD is characterized by a strong genotype-phenotype correlation, so depending on the alteration of the TNFRSN11B gene, the phenotype is variable.

The high drug resistance rates of malarial parasites make its eradication difficult and furthermore necessitate the development of new antimalarial drugs. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for severe malaria and therefore of special interest with regard to drug development. Plasmodium parasites are highly dependent on glucose and very sensitive to oxidative stress; two observations that drew interest to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) with its key enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). A central position of the PPP for malaria parasites is supported by the fact that human G6PD deficiency protects to a certain degree from malaria infections. Plasmodium parasites and the human host possess a complete PPP, both of which seem to be important for the parasites. Interestingly, there are major differences between parasite and human G6PD, making the enzyme of Plasmodium a promising target for antimalarial drug design. This review gives an overview of the current state of research on glucose-6-phosphate metabolism in P. falciparum and its impact on malaria infections. Moreover, the unique characteristics of the enzyme G6PD in P. falciparum are discussed, upon which its current status as promising target for drug development is based.</text></passage></document><document><id>1772</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A new explanation for recessive myotonia congenita: exon deletions and duplications in CLCN1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether exon deletions or duplications in CLCN1 are associated with recessive myotonia congenita (MC). METHODS: We performed detailed clinical and electrophysiologic characterization in 60 patients with phenotypes consistent with MC. DNA sequencing of CLCN1 followed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to screen for exon copy number variation was undertaken in all patients. RESULTS: Exon deletions or duplications in CLCN1 were identified in 6% of patients with MC. Half had heterozygous exonic rearrangements. The other 2 patients (50%), with severe disabling infantile onset myotonia, were identified with both a homozygous mutation, Pro744Thr, which functional electrophysiology studies suggested was nonpathogenic, and a triplication/homozygous duplication involving exons 8-14, suggesting an explanation for the severe phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that copy number variation in CLCN1 may be an important cause of recessive MC. Our observations suggest that it is important to check for exon deletions and duplications as part of the genetic analysis of patients with recessive MC, especially in patients in whom sequencing identifies no mutations or only a single recessive mutation. These results also indicate that additional, as yet unidentified, genetic mechanisms account for cases not currently explained by either CLCN1 point mutations or exonic deletions or duplications.</text></passage></document><document><id>1773</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Tetrasomy 15q26: a distinct syndrome or Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome phenocopy?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical phenotype of patients with tetrasomy of the distal 15q chromosome in the form of a neocentric marker chromosome and to evaluate whether the phenotype represents a new clinical syndrome or is a phenocopy of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. METHODS: We carried out comprehensive clinical evaluation of four patients who were identified with a supernumerary marker chromosome. The marker chromosome was characterized by G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism oligonucleotide microarray analysis, and immunofluorescence with antibodies to centromere protein C. RESULTS: The marker chromosomes were categorized as being neocentric with all showing tetrasomy for regions distal to 15q25 and the common region of overlap being 15q26 > qter. CONCLUSION: Tetrasomy of 15q26 likely results in a distinct syndrome as the patients with tetrasomy 15q26 share a strikingly more consistent phenotype than do the patients with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome, who show remarkable clinical variation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1774</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel missense variants in LCAT and APOB genes in an Italian kindred with familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency and hypobetalipoproteinemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>160</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is responsible for cholesterol esterification in plasma. Mutations of LCAT gene cause familial LCAT deficiency, a metabolic disorder characterized by hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the main protein component of very-low-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Mutations of APOB gene cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, a codominant disorder characterized by low plasma levels of LDL cholesterol and apoB. OBJECTIVE: This was a genetic and biochemical analysis of an Italian kindred with hypobetalipoproteinemia whose proband presented with hypoalphalipoproteinemia and severe chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Plasma lipids and apolipoproteins, cholesterol esterification, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclass distribution were analyzed. LCAT and APOB genes were sequenced. RESULTS: The proband had severe impairment of plasma cholesterol esterification and high preb-HDL content. He was heterozygote for the novel LCAT P406L variant, as were two other family members. The proband's wife and children presented with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and were heterozygotes for the novel apoB H1401R variant. Cholesterol esterification rate of apoB H1401R carriers was reduced, likely attributable to the low amount of circulating LDL. After renal transplantation, proband's lipid profile, HDL subclass distribution, and plasma cholesterol esterification were almost at normal levels, suggesting a mild contribution of the LCAT P406L variant to his pretransplantation severe hypoalphalipoproteinemia and impairment of plasma cholesterol esterification. CONCLUSION: LCAT P406L variant had a mild effect on lipid profile, HDL subclass distribution, and plasma cholesterol esterification. ApoB H1401R variant was identified as possible cause of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and resulted in a reduction of cholesterol esterification rate.</text></passage></document><document><id>1775</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Is colorectal surveillance indicated in patients with PTEN mutations?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>AIM: Patients with germline phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) mutations develop hamartomatous lesions in several organs and are at increased risk of various malignancies. We assessed the lifetime risk of benign and malignant gastrointestinal lesions in patients with a proven PTEN mutation. METHOD: Data on gender, mutation, dates of birth, last contact, and diagnosis, location and type of gastrointestinal lesions were collected from nine countries. The lifetime risk of gastrointestinal lesions was calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients (67 men, 43%) from 101 families with a PTEN mutation were included. Patients were born between 1928 and 2008. Benign gastrointestinal polyps were reported in 49 (31%) patients at a mean age of 38 years (range 18-62 years) and were most often hamartomas. Twenty-two (44%) patients had upper as well as lower gastrointestinal lesions, 14 (29%) had only colonic lesions and 13 (27%) had gastrointestinal lesions at unknown sites. The cumulative risk of developing benign gastrointestinal polyps was 70% at age 60. Four patients (two men) developed colorectal carcinoma at 53, 57, 59 and 62 years, respectively. The cumulative risk of developing colorectal carcinoma was 18% at age 60. Except for one carcinoid in the small intestine, no upper gastrointestinal cancers were observed. CONCLUSION: Benign gastrointestinal lesions are common in PTEN mutation carriers, and a three- to four-fold increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer compared with the general population may exist. Colorectal screening of patients with germline PTEN mutations is recommended, starting at age 40 years.</text></passage></document><document><id>1776</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and juvenile polyposis in a two-year-old girl].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is a rare disease, which is characterized by macrocephaly, benign hamartomas, lipomas, haemangiomas, pigmented maculae, developmental delay and mental retardation.

We report here on a family in which a severe form of skeletal dysplasia was recurrent in two sibs whose phenotype was most consistent with platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia Torrance type (PLSD-T). A COL2A1 analysis showed that the two sibs had a heterozygous mutation in the encoded triple helical region of COL2A1, c.3545G>A (p.Gly1182Asp) in exon 50. The parents did not consent to a molecular analysis; however, the presence of the same mutation in the two sibs is proof of germinal mosaicism in one of the parents. PLSD-T has been shown to arise from a heterozygous dominant negative COL2A1 mutation in the encoded C-propeptide region.

ATM is the predominant kinase that phosphorylates H2AX in chromatin around DNA double-strand breaks, including along lymphocyte Ag receptor loci cleaved during V(D)J recombination. However, combined germline inactivation of Atm and H2ax in mice causes early embryonic lethality associated with substantial cellular genomic instability, indicating that ATM and H2AX exhibit nonredundant functions in embryonic cells. To evaluate potential nonredundant roles of ATM and H2AX in somatic cells, we generated and analyzed Atm-deficient mice with conditional deletion of H2ax in ab T-lineage lymphocytes. Combined Atm/H2ax inactivation starting in early-stage CD4(-)/CD8(-) thymocytes resulted in lower numbers of later-stage CD4(+)/CD8(+) thymocytes, but led to no discernible V(D)J recombination defect in G1 phase cells beyond that observed in Atm-deficient cells. H2ax deletion in Atm-deficient thymocytes also did not affect the incidence or mortality of mice from thymic lymphomas with clonal chromosome 14 (TCRa/  ) translocations. Yet, in vitro-stimulated Atm/H2ax-deficient splenic ab T cells exhibited a higher frequency of genomic instability, including radial chromosome translocations and TCRb translocations, compared with cells lacking Atm or H2ax. Collectively, our data demonstrate that both redundant and nonredundant functions of ATM and H2AX are required for normal recombination of TCR loci, proliferative expansion of developing thymocytes, and maintenance of genomic stability in cycling ab T-lineage cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>1780</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>GUCY2C molecular staging personalizes colorectal cancer patient management.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>While the most significant prognostic and predictive marker in the management of colorectal cancer patients is cancer cells in regional lymph nodes, approximately 30% of patients whose lymph nodes are ostensibly free of tumor cells by histopathology ultimately develop recurrent disease reflecting occult metastases.

The strongest linkage peak of prostate cancer overlies a variable region of ~750 kb at Xq27 enriched by segmental duplications (SDs), suggesting that the predisposition to prostate cancer may be a genomic disorder caused by recombinational interaction between SDs. The large size of SDs and their sequence similarity make it difficult to examine this region for possible rearrangements using standard methods. To overcome this problem, direct isolation of a set of genomic segments by in vivo recombination in yeast (a TAR cloning technique) was used to perform a mutational analysis of the 750 kb region in X-linked families. We did not detect disease-specific rearrangements within this region. In addition, transcriptome and computational analyses were performed to search for nonannotated genes within the Xq27 region, which may be associated with genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. Two candidate genes were identified, one of which is a novel gene termed SPANXL that represents a highly diverged member of the SPANX gene family, and the previously described CDR1 gene that is expressed at a high level in both normal and malignant prostate cells, and mapped 210 kb of upstream the SPANX gene cluster. No disease-specific alterations were identified in these genes. Our results exclude the 750-kb genetically unstable region at Xq27 as a candidate locus for prostate malignancy. Adjacent regions appear to be the most likely candidates to identify the elusive HPCX1 locus.</text></passage></document><document><id>1782</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy presenting as Addison's disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset><text>We report the case of a young man with a history of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and mild cognitive impairment who presented with chronic fatigue, anorexia and progressive darkening of the skin.

Although rare, pediatric cases pose a particular challenge in diagnosis and management. In children, the clinical appearance may be heterogeneous and a high index of suspicion is necessary to avoid delays in diagnosis which can lead to further morbidity. Histologic examination, often with the use of appropriate immunostains, is necessary for diagnosis. Advances in the understanding of the molecular genetics of DFSP have led to further diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. DFSP is thought to result from a translocation between platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGFB, 22q13.1) and type 1 collagen (COL1A1, 17q21   22) leading to a fusion protein (PDGFB) which stimulates the PDGF receptor. Detection of this translocation in tissue via PCR or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be helpful in difficult cases. While surgery with wide local excision or Mohs micrographic surgery is the mainstay of treatment, the use of targeted therapy with imatanib mesylate shows promise in large or unresectable tumors.

Recently, we have shown that netrin-1 also interacts with the orphan transmembrane receptor amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved by proteases, generating amyloid-b peptide, the main component of the amyloid plaques that are associated with Alzheimer disease. Our previous work demonstrated that via its interaction with APP, netrin-1 is a negative regulator of amyloid-b production in adult brain, but the biological relevance of APP/netrin-1 interaction under non-pathological conditions was unknown. We show here that during commissural axon navigation, APP, expressed at the growth cone, is part of the DCC receptor complex mediating netrin-1-dependent axon guidance. APP interacts with DCC in the presence of netrin-1 and enhances netrin-1-mediated DCC intracellular signaling, such as MAPK activation. Inactivation of APP in mice is associated with reduced commissural axon outgrowth. Thus, APP functionally acts as a co-receptor for DCC to mediate axon guidance.</text></passage></document><document><id>1786</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>GM2 gangliosidoses in Spain: analysis of the HEXA and HEXB genes in 34 Tay-Sachs and 14 Sandhoff patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>The GM2 gangliosidoses are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases caused by a deficiency of the b-hexosaminidase A enzyme.

We analyzed the complete HEXA gene in 34 Spanish patients with Tay-Sachs disease and the HEXB gene in 14 Spanish patients with Sandhoff disease. We identified 27 different mutations, 14 of which were novel, in the HEXA gene and 14 different mutations, 8 of which unreported until now, in the HEXB gene, and we attempted to correlate these mutations with the clinical presentation of the patients. We found a high frequency of c.459+5G>A (IVS4+5G>A) mutation in HEXA affected patients, 22 of 68 alleles, which represent the 32.4%. This is the highest percentage found of this mutation in a population.

Thus, the absence of phenotypic abnormalities does not exclude the presence of a genetic predisposition, suggesting that more Wilms tumour patients may have a constitutional abnormality. Therefore, we investigated the frequency of constitutional aberrations in combination with phenotype. PATIENTS _ METHODS: Clinical genetic assessment, as well as molecular analysis of WT1 and locus 11p15 was offered to a single-centre cohort of 109 childhood Wilms tumour patients. RESULTS: Twelve patients (11%) had a WT1 aberration and eight patients (8%) had an 11p15 aberration. Of the 12 patients with a WT1 aberration, four had WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary malformations and mental retardation), one had Denys-Drash syndrome, four had genitourinary anomalies without other syndromic features and three had bilateral disease with stromal-predominant histology at young age without congenital anomalies. Of the eight patients with an 11p15 aberration, four had Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), two had minor features of BWS and two had no stigmata of BWS or hemihypertrophy. CONCLUSION: Constitutional WT1 or 11p15 aberrations are frequent in Wilms tumour patients and careful clinical assessment can identify the majority of these patients. Therefore, we would recommend offering clinical genetic counselling to all Wilms tumour patients, as well as molecular analysis to patients with clinical signs of a syndrome or with features that may indicate a constitutional WT1 or 11p15 aberration.</text></passage></document><document><id>1789</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characteristics and spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in 3,922 Korean patients with breast and ovarian cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>This investigation is aimed at evaluating the epidemiologic characteristics of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in Korean patients with breast and ovarian cancer (BOC). We analyzed the entire mutational data of BRCA1/2 genes in BOC patients who were tested in Korea since the first Korean report of BRCA1 mutation in 1995 with the exception of the data covered in the Korean Hereditary Breast Cancer (KOHBRA) study, the project launched in 2007 for establishing BRCA1/2 carrier cohorts in Korea. In total, BRCA1/2 gene mutations of 3,922 Korean BOC patients were evaluated, including the unpublished data of 2,139 breast cancer patients examined by four Korean institutions and the data of 1,783 BOC patients covered in ten previous reports. Overall, 420 (150 distinct) pathogenic mutations were identified, 211 (73 distinct) in BRCA1 and 209 (77 distinct) in BRCA2. The majority (134 of 150) of the distinct mutations resulted in premature termination codon of the BRCA1/2 translation. BRCA1 c.4186-1593_4676-1465del was the only large genomic rearrangements mutation. Out of 150 distinct BRCA1/2 mutations, 84 (56 %) mutations were considered specific to Korean BOC. Eighty-five BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in at least two unrelated patients. These recurrent mutations account for 84.5 % (355 of 420) of mutations detected in the Korean population. In the pooled mutational data of BRCA1/2 genes, this study discovered the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in the Korean BOC patients is similar to those found in other ethnic groups. Large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1/2 genes were infrequently detected among the Korean patients with BOC. There were several BRCA1/2 mutation candidates for founder mutations. To further establish a Korean cohort for BRCA1/2 mutations, the nationwide KOHBRA study is in progress.</text></passage></document><document><id>1790</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A novel and de novo deletion in the OCRL1 gene associated with a severe form of Lowe syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>95</offset><text>The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) is an X-linked disorder.

To detect the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion, almost previous reports performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using multiplex forward primers from COL1A1. However, it has possible technical difficulties with respect to the handling of multiple primers and reagents in the procedure. The objective of this study is to establish a rapid, easy, and efficient one-step method of PCR using only a single primer pair to detect the fusion transcripts of the COL1A1 and PDGFB in DFSP. To validate new method, we compared the results of RT-PCR in five patients of DFSP between the previous method using multiplex primers and our established one-step RT-PCR using a single primer pair. In all cases of DFSP, the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected by both previous method and newly established one-step PCR. Importantly, we detected a novel COL1A1 breakpoint in exon 5. The newly developed method is valuable to rapidly identify COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcripts in DFSP.</text></passage></document><document><id>1792</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The galactocerebrosidase enzyme contributes to maintain a functional neurogenic niche during early post-natal CNS development.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>We report a novel role for the lysosomal galactosylceramidase (GALC), which is defective in globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), in maintaining a functional post-natal subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic niche. We show that proliferation/self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs) and survival of their neuronal and oligodendroglial progeny are impaired in GALC-deficient mice. Using drugs to modulate inflammation and gene transfer to rescue GALC expression and activity, we show that lipid accumulation resulting from GALC deficiency acts as a cell-autonomous pathogenic stimulus in enzyme-deficient NSCs and progeny before upregulation of inflammatory markers, which later sustain a non-cell-autonomous dysfunction. Importantly, we provide evidence that supply of functional GALC provided by neonatal intracerebral transplantation of NSCs ameliorates the functional impairment in endogenous SVZ cells. Insights into the mechanism/s underlying GALC-mediated regulation of early post-natal neurogenic niches improve our understanding of the multi-component pathology of GLD. The occurrence of a restricted period of SVZ neurogenesis in infancy supports the implications of our study for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat this severe pediatric neurodegenerative disorder.</text></passage></document><document><id>1793</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 R1699Q variant displaying ambiguous functional abrogation confers intermediate breast and ovarian cancer risk.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Clinical classification of rare sequence changes identified in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 is essential for appropriate genetic counselling of individuals carrying these variants. We previously showed that variant BRCA1 c.5096G>A p.Arg1699Gln in the BRCA1 transcriptional transactivation domain demonstrated equivocal results from a series of functional assays, and proposed that this variant may confer low to moderate risk of cancer. METHODS: Measures of genetic risk (report of family history, segregation) were assessed for 68 BRCA1 c.5096G>A p.Arg1699Gln (R1699Q) families recruited through family cancer clinics, comparing results with 34 families carrying the previously classified pathogenic BRCA1 c.5095C>T p.Arg1699Trp (R1699W) mutation at the same residue, and to 243 breast cancer families with no BRCA1 pathogenic mutation (BRCA-X). RESULTS: Comparison of BRCA1 carrier prediction scores of probands using the BOADICEA risk prediction tool revealed that BRCA1 c.5096G>A p.Arg1699Gln variant carriers had family histories that were less 'BRCA1-like' than BRCA1 c.5095C>T p.Arg1699Trp mutation carriers (p&lt;0.00001), but more 'BRCA1-like' than BRCA-X families (p=0.0004). Further, modified segregation analysis of the subset of 30 families with additional genotyping showed that BRCA1 c.5096G   >A p.Arg1699Gln had reduced penetrance compared with the average truncating BRCA1 mutation penetrance (p=0.0002), with estimated cumulative risks to age 70 of breast or ovarian cancer of 24%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide substantial evidence that the BRCA1 c.5096G>A p.Arg1699Gln (R1699Q) variant, demonstrating ambiguous functional deficiency across multiple assays, is associated with intermediate risk of breast and ovarian cancer, highlighting challenges for risk modelling and clinical management of patients of this and other potential moderate-risk variants.</text></passage></document><document><id>1794</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Factor H autoantibodies and deletion of Complement Factor H-Related protein-1 in rheumatic diseases in comparison to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>153</offset><text>INTRODUCTION: Complement activation is involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Autoantibodies to complement inhibitor factor H (FH), particularly in association with deletions of the gene coding for FH-related protein 1 (CFHR1), are associated with aHUS. METHODS: Autoantibodies against FH, factor I (FI) and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) were measured by ELISA, while CFHR1 homozygous deletion was determined with Western blotting of sera. Epitopes for FH autoantibodies were mapped using recombinant fragments of FH. RESULTS: FH autoantibodies were detected in SLE (6.7%, n = 60, RA patients (16.5%, n = 97 in the Swedish cohort and 9.2%, n = 217 in the Dutch cohort) and thrombosis patients positive for the lupus anticoagulants (LA+) test (9.4%, n = 64) compared with aHUS patients (11.7%, n = 103). In the control groups (n = 354), an average of 4% of individuals were positive for FH autoantibodies. The frequencies observed in both RA cohorts and LA+ patients were statistically significantly higher than in controls. We also found that an average of 15.2% of the FH-autoantibody positive individuals in all studied disease groups had homozygous deficiency of CFHR1 compared with 3.8% of the FH autoantibody negative patients. The levels of FH autoantibodies varied in individual patients over time. FH autoantibodies found in LA+, SLE and RA were directed against several epitopes across FH in contrast to those found in aHUS, which bound mainly to the C-terminus. Autoantibodies against FI and C4BP were detected in some patients and controls but they were not associated with any of the diseases analyzed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibodies against FH are not specific for aHUS but are present at a significant frequency in rheumatic diseases where they could be involved in pathophysiological mechanisms.</text></passage></document><document><id>1795</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and inner ear hearing loss (Wolfram syndrome) in a 29-year-old patient].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset></passage></document><document><id>1796</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Strain-specific hyperkyphosis and megaesophagus in Add1 null mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset><text>The three adducin proteins (a, b, and y) share extensive sequence, structural, and functional homology.

Such ATM mutations may be particularly relevant in the setting of del11q, which invariably results in the deletion of one ATM allele. To improve our understanding of the frequency and type of ATM mutations that exist in CLL, we resequenced all ATM coding exons in 24 CLL with del11q using direct sequencing. We detected two missense mutations, resulting in an ATM mutation frequency of 8%; nonsense and frameshift mutations were not identified. Given the low ATM mutation frequency detected in this cohort, we proceeded with measurements of nonmutational ATM aberrations in CLL through analysis of the activation state of ATM in response to external irradiation. The phosphorylation state of ATM at Ser-1981 was measured using quantitative immunoblotting in purified CLL cells isolated from 251 CLL patients; data were normalized to simultaneous measurements of total ATM protein and actin. Resulting p-ATM/ATM and p-ATM/actin ratios were subsequently analyzed for prognostic significance inclusive and exclusive of TP53 exons 2-10 mutations. From these analyses, conducted in a large prospectively enrolled CLL patient cohort, neither the p-ATM/ATM nor the p-ATM/actin ratios were found to be prognostic for short survival. These data in aggregate demonstrate a low frequency of ATM aberrations in an unselected CLL cohort and do not support a major prognostic role for ATM aberrations in CLL, thus motivating renewed research efforts aimed at understanding the pathobiology of 11q deletions in CLL.    2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</text></passage></document><document><id>1799</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Unusual molecular characteristics of a repeat sequence island within a Giemsa-positive band on the mouse X chromosome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>119</offset><text>The mouse genome contains 50 copies of a long complex repeat unit localized as a repeat sequence island to the A3 Giemsa-positive (dark) band on the mouse X chromosome.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 858 children aged 6-35 months who were randomly selected from 60 villages in western Kenya. Haemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, malaria, C-reactive protein (CRP) and retinol binding protein (RBP) were measured from capillary blood. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Hb type, -3.7   kb alpha-globin chain deletion, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) genotype and haptoglobin (Hp) genotype were determined. More than 2 out of 3 children had at least one measured blood disorder. Sickle cell trait (HbAS) and disease (HbSS) were found in 17.1% and 1.6% of children, respectively; 38.5% were heterozygotes and 9.6% were homozygotes for a(+) -thalassaemia. The Hp 2-2 genotype was found in 20.4% of children, whereas 8.2% of males and 6.8% of children overall had G6PD deficiency. There were no significant differences in the distribution of malaria by the measured blood disorders, except among males with G6PD deficiency who had a lower prevalence of clinical malaria than males of normal G6PD genotype (P   =   0.005). After excluding children with malaria parasitaemia, inflammation (CRP   >   5   mg   L(-1) ), iron deficiency (ferritin   &lt;   12    g   L(-1) ) or vitamin A deficiency (RBP   &lt;   0.7    g   L(-1) ), the prevalence of anaemia among those without a(+) -thalassaemia (43.0%) remained significantly lower than that among children who were either heterozygotes (53.5%) or homozygotes (67.7%, P   =   0.03). Inherited blood disorders are common among pre-school children in western Kenya and are important contributors to anaemia.</text></passage></document><document><id>1801</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 required for transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a zinc finger protein of unknown function .

We present a family with five out of six children affected with ACD/MPV. DNA analysis identified a missense mutation (c.416G>T; p.Arg139Leu) in the FOXF1 gene that segregated in the three affected siblings tested. The same variant is also present as a de novo mutation in the mother and arose on her paternally derived chromosome 16. The two tested affected siblings share the same chromosome 16 haplotype inherited from their maternal grandfather. Their single healthy sibling has a different chromosome 16 haplotype inherited from the maternal grandmother.

Targeted therapy in this disease would benefit from advanced technologies detecting relevant actionable mutations. PROCEDURE: Here we report on the evaluation of 25 tumors, all with known SMARCB1/INI1 alterations, for the presence of 983 different mutations in 115 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes using OncoMap, a mass spectrometric method of allele detection. RESULTS: Other than mutations in SMARCB1, our results identified a single activating mutation in NRAS and complete absence of oncogenic mutations in all other genes tested. CONCLUSION: The absence of mutations in canonical pathways critical for development and progression of adult cancers suggests that distinct mechanisms drive these highly malignant pediatric tumors. This may limit the therapeutic utility of available targeted therapies and require a refocusing toward developmental and epigenetic pathways.</text></passage></document><document><id>1805</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Combating cancer predisposition in association with idiopathic immune deficiency: a recurrent nodal and cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disease in a patient with cartilage-hair hypoplasia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>194</offset></passage></document><document><id>1806</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Commentary on "comparative effectiveness of axitinib vs. sorafenib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (AXIS): a randomized phase 3 trial."

Patients with WAS typically demonstrate micro-thrombocytopenia. PROCEDURES: The report describes seven male infants with WAS that initially presented with leukocytosis, monocytosis, and myeloid and erythroid precursors in the peripheral blood (PB) and dysplasia in the bone marrow (BM), which was initially indistinguishable from juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). RESULTS: The median age of affected patients was 1 month (range, 1-4 months). Splenomegaly was absent in four of these patients, which was unusual for JMML. A mutation analysis of genes in the RAS-signalling pathway did not support a diagnosis of JMML. Non-haematological features, such as eczema (n   =   7) and bloody stools (n   =   6), ultimately led to the diagnosis of WAS at a median age of 4 months (range, 3-8 months), which was confirmed by absent (n   =   6) or reduced (n   =   1) WASP expression in lymphocytes by flow cytometry (FCM) and a WASP gene mutation. Interestingly, mean platelet volume (MPV) was normal in three of five patients and six of seven patients demonstrated occasional giant platelets, which was not compatible with WAS. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that WAS should be considered in male infants presenting with JMML-like features if no molecular markers of JMML can be detected.</text></passage></document><document><id>1808</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A reexamination of end-point and rebound nystagmus in normals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset><text>In order to detail the characteristics of end-point (EPN) and rebound nystagmus (RN), two series of experiments were performed with infrared oculography for measurement of horizontal eye movements.

Recently, a rare, recurrent mutation (G84E) in HOXB13 was reported to be associated with prostate cancer risk. Confirmation and characterization of this finding is necessary to potentially translate this information to the clinic. To examine this finding in a large international sample of prostate cancer families, we genotyped this mutation and 14 other SNPs in or flanking HOXB13 in 2,443 prostate cancer families recruited by the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). At least one mutation carrier was found in 112 prostate cancer families (4.6 %), all of European descent. Within carrier families, the G84E mutation was more common in men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer (194 of 382, 51 %) than those without (42 of 137, 30 %), P = 9.9 * 10(-8) [odds ratio 4.42 (95 % confidence interval 2.56-7.64)]. A family-based association test found G84E to be significantly over-transmitted from parents to affected offspring (P = 6.5 * 10(-6)). Analysis of markers flanking the G84E mutation indicates that it resides in the same haplotype in 95 % of carriers, consistent with a founder effect. Clinical characteristics of cancers in mutation carriers included features of high-risk disease. These findings demonstrate that the HOXB13 G84E mutation is present in ~5 % of prostate cancer families, predominantly of European descent, and confirm its association with prostate cancer risk. While future studies are needed to more fully define the clinical utility of this observation, this allele and others like it could form the basis for early, targeted screening of men at elevated risk for this common, clinically heterogeneous cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>1810</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Early intervention combined with targeted treatment promotes cognitive and behavioral improvements in young children with fragile x syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>142</offset><text>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability due to an expansion in the full mutation range (>200 CGG repeats) of the promoter region of the FMR1 gene leading to gene silencing.

During the assay procedures, the operated preimplantation embryos were cultured. They were then transferred, in batches as diagnosed, to recipient females. The resulting fetuses were sexed by gonad morphology and assayed for HPRT activity. All those identified as HPRT-negative embryos by biopsy at the 8-cell or blastocyst stages were indeed HPRT-negative males. The heterozygous females were also correctly identified by the trophectoderm biopsy procedure. The sex of an embryo can also be diagnosed by HPRT activity dosage in a single blastomere taken from 8-cell embryos from a normal mating and cultured for 12 hours before assay. Both X chromosomes are active in female morulae and the blastomeres sampled from female preimplantation embryos have twice the X-coded HPRT activity compared to those from the male embryos. The accuracy of this procedure for sexing was again verified by transfer of the putative male and putative female embryos into recipient females.</text></passage></document><document><id>1813</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Comparison of X-chromosome inactivation in Duchenne muscle/myocardium-manifesting carriers, non-manifesting carriers and related daughters.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>140</offset><text>Female carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually asymptomatic. However, 2.5-7.8% of them may present muscle symptoms and cardiomyopathy, attributed to a reduced production of dystrophin, probably because of skewed patterns of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). To evaluate the role of XCI in symptomatic (at muscle or heart level) and asymptomatic DMD carriers, 44 subjects were selected from our database (12 manifesting, 21 non-manifesting, 11 healthy females), and XCI pattern determined in the lymphocytes by the androgen receptor methylation-based assay. The results showed that DMD-manifesting carriers had a preferential inactivation of the X-chromosome carrying the normal allele, while non-manifesting carriers and healthy females showed a random XCI pattern. Moreover, when comparing muscle with heart manifesting carriers, the former group showed a higher degree of skewing. No concordance in XCI was found between mothers and daughters, when symptomatic/asymptomatic mother-daughter pairs were analyzed. The results confirm that DMD clinical manifestations in carriers are associated with non-random patterns of X inactivation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1814</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic Diversity and Balancing Selection within the Human Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (PAH) Gene Region in Iranian Population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity of three polymorphic markers in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene region including PvuII (a), PAHSTR and MspI were investigated. METHODS: Unrelated individuals (n=139) from the Iranian populations were genotyped using primers specific to PAH gene markers including PvuII(a), MspI and PAHSTR. The amplified products for PvuII(a), MspI were digested using the appropriate restriction enzymes and separated on 1.5% agarose. The PAHSTR alleles were identified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. The exact size of the STR alleles was determined by sequencing. The allele frequency and population status of the alleles were estimated using PHASE, FBAT and GENEPOP software. RESULTS: The estimated degree of heterozygosity for PAHSTR, MspI and PvuII (a) was 66%, 56% and 58%, respectively. The haplotype estimation analysis of the markers resulted in nine informative haplotypes with frequencies >= 5%. Moreover, the results obtained from Ewens-Watterson test for neutrality suggested that the markers were under balancing selection in the Iranian population. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested the presence of genetic diversity at these three markers in the PAH gene region. Therefore, the markers could be considered as functional markers for linkage analysis of the PAH gene mutations in the Iranian families with the PKU disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1815</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Lessons from the hepatoblastoma-familial polyposis connection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>63</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Approximately one-third of hepatoblastoma (HB) patients have associated congenital abnormalities, but familial recurrence is rare, except in association with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). This correlation may be missed if not actively sought, with implications for long-term outcome and management. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 3 families with an HB-familial polyposis connection, from a cohort of 113 FAP families (1989 - 2010). Data were analysed to assess clinical problem, treatment, complications and management. Long-term morbidity and functional outcome were analysed to identify management difficulties. RESULTS: Three FAP families (2.65%) had an HB association. In one case, undiagnosed FAP at the time of HB diagnosis was only detected 5 years later, when the mother presented with advanced colorectal carcinoma. A chromosome 5 APC gene mutation (exon 15 codon 793 C > T) was then identified. In a second case, a non-related male child presented with a stage 4 multifocal HB with lung metastases. Genetic studies identified an APC gene mutation (exon 6 codon 232 C > T). Further family investigation showed >20 related FAP patients. A third HB-FAP association was identified in a known FAP family early in the study, prior to the availability of genetic testing. CONCLUSION: Although a rare association, a family history of FAP in HB patients is an important 'hidden connection'. Germline variation may be outside the usual FAP gene site. Identifying families with unknown HB/FAP is important due to long-term management implications and follow-up.</text></passage></document><document><id>1816</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Angelman syndrome and severe infections in a patient with de novo 15q11.2-q13.1 deletion and maternally inherited 2q21.3 microdeletion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation, severe speech disorder, facial dysmorphism, secondary microcephaly, ataxia, seizures, and abnormal behaviors such as easily provoked laughter. It is most frequently caused by a de novo maternal deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 (about 70-90%), but can also be caused by paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15q11-q13 (3-7%), an imprinting defect (2-4%) or in mutations in the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A gene UBE3A mostly leading to frame shift mutation. In addition, for patients with overlapping clinical features (Angelman-like syndrome), mutations in methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene MECP2 and cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 gene CDKL5 as well as a microdeletion of 2q23.1 including the methyl-CpG binding domain protein 5 gene MBD5 have been described. Here, we describe a patient who carries a de novo 5Mb-deletion of chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 known to be associated with Angelman syndrome and a further, maternally inherited deletion 2q21.3 (~364kb) of unknown significance. In addition to classic features of Angelman syndrome, she presented with severe infections in the first year of life, a symptom that has not been described in patients with Angelman syndrome. The 15q11.2-q13.1 deletion contains genes critical for Prader-Willi syndrome, the Angelman syndrome causing genes UBE3A and ATP10A/C, and several non-imprinted genes: GABRB3 and GABRA5 (both encoding subunits of GABA A receptor), GOLGA6L2, HERC2 and OCA2 (associated with oculocutaneous albinism II). The deletion 2q21.3 includes exons of the genes RAB3GAP1 (associated with Warburg Micro syndrome) and ZRANB3 (not disease-associated). Despite the normal phenotype of the mother, the relevance of the 2q21.3 microdeletion for the phenotype of the patient cannot be excluded, and further case reports will need to address this point.</text></passage></document><document><id>1817</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Perturbations in the HDL metabolic pathway predispose to the development of osteoarthritis in mice following long-term exposure to western-type diet.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>150</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Recent data suggest that obesity and related metabolic aberrations are associated with osteoarthritis (OA) development, a phenomenon that is attributed at least in part to the consumption of lipid-rich diets. To date, the molecular mechanisms that govern the lipid-OA connection remain largely unknown. Given the important role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma and tissue lipid metabolism, the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of HDL metabolism in the pathobiology of OA. METHODS: We used apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)(-/-) mice that lack classical apoA-I containing HDL, LCAT(-/-) mice that have only immature HDL and relatively reduced HDL-cholesterol levels and control C57BL/6 mice. Mice were placed on chow or western-type (WTD) and monitored for 24 weeks. Knee joints were removed and articular cartilage was isolated for further analyses. RESULTS: The LCAT(-/-) mice were significantly more sensitive to the development of diet-induced obesity compared to the C57BL/6 and apoA-I(-/-) mice. Morphological, biochemical and molecular analyses revealed that the LCAT(-/-) obese mice developed OA, while the C57BL/6 mice that were fed WTD did not. Notably, apoA-I(-/-) mice that received WTD also developed OA although their body-weight gain was similar to their wild-type counterparts. Interestingly, bone marrow from LCAT(-/-) and apoA-I(-/-) mice contained significantly increased number of adipocytes, compared to the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that perturbations in HDL metabolism predispose to OA following chronic insult with WTD and raise the challenging possibility that HDL has a causative relation to OA in patients with metabolic syndrome.</text></passage></document><document><id>1818</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of ZNF350/ZBRK1 promoter variants and breast cancer susceptibility in non-BRCA1/2 French Canadian breast cancer families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>ZNF350/ZBRK1 is a transcription factor, which associates with BRCA1 to co-repress GADD45A to regulate DNA damage repair, and the expression of ZNF350 is altered in different human carcinomas. In a previous study, we identified ZNF350 genomic variants potentially involved in breast cancer susceptibility in high-risk non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer individuals, which pointed toward a potential association for variants in the 5'-UTR and promoter regions. Therefore, direct sequencing was undertaken and identified 12 promoter variants, whereas haplotype analyses put in evidence four common haplotypes with a frequency>2%. However, based on their frequency observed in breast cancer and unrelated healthy individuals, these are not statistically associated with breast cancer risk. Luciferase promoter assays in two breast cancer cell lines identified two haplotypes (H11 and H12) stimulating significantly the expression of ZNF350 transcript compared with the common haplotype H8. The high expression of the H11 allele was associated with the variant c.-874A. Using MatInspector and Transcription Element Search softwares, in silico analyses predicted that the variant c.-874A created a binding site for the factors c-Myc and myogenin. This study represents the first characterization step of the ZNF350 promoter. Additional studies in larger cohorts and other populations will be needed to further evaluate whether common and/or rare ZNF350 promoter variants and haplotypes could be associated with a modest risk of breast cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>1819</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Screening of Finnish RAD51C founder mutations in prostate and colorectal cancer patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Rare, heterozygous germline mutations in the RAD51C gene have been found in breast and ovarian cancer families.

Our goal is the estimation of the age-specific and lifetime penetrances of DCIS among carriers of either a BRCA1 or BRCA2 deleterious mutation. We jointly re-analyze the SEER9 database and a previous study by Claus et al. (JAMA 293:964-969, 2005). Estimation is performed via Bayes theorem after the evaluation of the ratio of age-specific DCIS incidences, and extrapolation to the general population of the study-specific penetrance obtained from Claus et al. From the SEER9 database, we estimate the lifetime risk of DCIS to be 0.98 %, in contrast to value of 12.5 % usually reported for IBC. By extending the result in Claus et al. to the general population, we obtain a lifetime risk for carriers of a deleterious mutation of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 of 6.21 % (95 % CI 6.09-6.33 %). The increase in lifetime risk of DCIS for a BRCA mutation carrier compared to a non-carrier is therefore about six-fold. Our quantification is directly relevant to the identification and genetic counseling of BRCA mutation carriers, and emphasizes the potential importance of including information on diagnoses of DCIS in counseling of individuals who are at familial risk for breast cancer. All these factors can contribute to a more specific and targeted prevention, potentially reducing the impact of IBC among BRCA mutation carriers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1821</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Oral contraceptives and the risk of hereditary ovarian cancer.

To identify risk factors for urticaria, to determine the relative proportion of the susceptibility to urticaria that is due to genetic factors in an adult clinical twin sample, and to further determine whether the genetic susceptibility to urticaria overlaps with the genetic susceptibility to atopic diseases. Methods. A total of 256 complete twin pairs and 63 single twins, who were selected from sibships with self-reported asthma via a questionnaire survey of 21,162 adult twins from the Danish Twin Registry, were clinically interviewed about a history of urticaria and examined for atopic diseases. Data were analysed with Cox proportional hazards regression and variance components models. Results. A total of 151 individuals (26%) had a history of urticaria, whereas 24 (4%) had had symptoms within the past year. Female sex, HR = 2.09 (1.46-2.99), P = 0.000; hay fever, HR = 1.92 (1.36-2.72), P = 0.000; and atopic dermatitis, HR = 1.44 (1.02-2.06), P = 0.041 were significant risk factors for urticaria. After adjustment for sex and age at onset of urticaria in the index twin, the risk of urticaria was increased in MZ cotwins relative to DZ cotwins, HR = 1.42 (0.63-3.18), P = 0.394. Genetic factors explained 45% (16-74%), P = 0.005, of the variation in susceptibility to urticaria. The genetic correlation between urticaria and hay fever was 0.45 (0.01-0.89), P = 0.040. Conclusions. Susceptibility to urticaria is partly determined by genetic factors. Urticaria is more common in women, and in subjects with hay fever and atopic dermatitis, and shares genetic variance with hay fever.</text></passage></document><document><id>1824</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>DOCA sensitive pendrin expression in kidney, heart, lung and thyroid tissues.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pendrin (SLC26A4), a transporter accomplishing anion exchange, is expressed in inner ear, thyroid gland, kidneys, lung, liver and heart. Loss or reduction of function mutations of SLC26A4 underlie Pendred syndrome, a disorder invariably leading to hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueducts and in some patients to hypothyroidism and goiter. Renal pendrin expression is up-regulated by mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone or deoxycorticosterone (DOCA). Little is known about the impact of mineralocorticoids on pendrin expression in extrarenal tissues. METHODS: The present study utilized RT-qPCR and Western blotting to quantify the transcript levels and protein abundance of Slc26a4 in murine kidney, thyroid, heart and lung prior to and following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg/kg DOCA. RESULTS: Slc26a4 transcript levels as compared to Gapdh transcript levels were significantly increased by DOCA treatment in kidney, heart, lung and thyroid. Accordingly pendrin protein expression was again significantly increased by DOCA treatment in kidney, heart, lung and thyroid. CONCLUSION: The observations reveal mineralocorticoid sensitivity of pendrin expression in kidney, heart, thyroid and lung.</text></passage></document><document><id>1825</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cardiac anomalies in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome due to a novel FOXC1 mutation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by ophthalmologic anterior segment abnormalities and extraocular findings including dental anomalies and redundant periumbilical skin. Intragenic mutations in the homeobox gene PITX2 or the transcription factor encoding FOXC1 were identified, and genomic rearrangements encompassing either gene also cause ARS. A molecular etiology is identified in 40-60%. Extraocular anomalies occur more often with intragenic PITX2 than FOXC1 mutations. We report on a patient with infantile glaucoma presenting at age 21 months with congestive heart failure due to a dysplastic arcade mitral valve necessitating valve replacement, and mildly hypoplastic left ventricular outflow tract and aortic arch. Family history included early onset glaucoma in four relatives; congenital hip dysplasia requiring surgery in three; and an atrial septal defect in the affected maternal grandmother. Despite the absence of dental or umbilical abnormalities, anterior chamber abnormalities consistent with ARS were present in affected individuals. Molecular testing revealed a novel FOXC1 mutation (c.508C>T; p.Arg170Trp) in the proband and his affected mother; other family members were unavailable. A literature review revealed four reports of congenital heart disease associated with intragenic FOXC1 mutations, and none with intragenic PITX2 mutations. Previously, mouse studies showed Foxc1 (Mf1) expression in the developing valves and atrial septum, supporting a causal relationship of FOXC1 mutations for valvar anomalies and ASD. Hip dysplasia in three family members suggests a role for FOXC1 in the femoral head dysplasia of de Hauwere syndrome with 6p25 deletions. Further reports of clinical and molecular diagnoses will clarify genotype-phenotype correlation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1826</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel and recurrent germline and somatic mutations in a cohort of 67 patients from 48 families with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome including the phenotypic variant of multiple familial trichoepitheliomas and correlation with the histopathologic findings in 379 biopsy specimens.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>273</offset><text>Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS) is a rare, inherited, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by development of multiple adnexal cutaneous neoplasms including spiradenoma, cylindroma, spiradenocylindroma, and trichoepithelioma. The syndrome of multiple familial trichoepitheliomas (MFT) is considered a phenotypic variant of BSS in which patients present with trichoepitheliomas only. We studied germline and somatic mutations of the CYLD gene by direct sequencing in patients with BSS (n = 49) and MFT (n = 18) using peripheral blood and 90 samples of frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue selected from 379 available histology specimens. Germline CYLD mutations were found in 51 patients (76%) from 36 families (75%). Germline CYLD mutations were found in 43 of the 49 patients with BSS (88%) but in only 8 of 18 MFT cohort (44%). Twenty-one frameshift, 15 nonsense, 3 missense, and 4 splice site mutations were found in patients with BSS, whereas 1 frameshift, 5 nonsense, and 2 splice site mutations were identified in the MFT cohort. Five novel mutations were identified including 4 frameshift mutations (c.1027dupA/p.T343NfsX7, c.2155dupA/p.M719NfsX5, c.2288_2289delTT/p.F763X, and c.2641delG/p.D881TfsX32) and 1 nonsense mutation (c.2713C>T/p. Q905X). Of the 76 tumors from 32 patients with a germline CYLD mutation, 12 were spiradenomas, 15 spiradenocylindromas, 26 cylindromas, 15 trichoepitheliomas, and 7 were other tumor types. Somatic mutations were detected in 67 specimens of these 76 tumors (88%). Of the 67 somatic mutations, 21 (31%) represented a sequence alteration and 46 (69%) showed loss of heterozygosity. In the remaining 9 cases (12%), the somatic changes remained unknown. A germline CYLD mutation was not detected in 14 tumor samples from 8 patients. In these 14 tumors, somatic mutations were identified in 6 samples (43%), all consisting of sequence alterations (1 sample showed 2 different sequence alterations). In the remaining 8 samples (53%), neither germline nor somatic mutations were found in the lesional tissue. Our study increases the catalog of known CYLD mutations in patients with BSS/MFT to 86 and documents the variability of somatic mutations that may occur in them. We confirm the absence of firm genotype-phenotype correlations and the existence of a subset of patients with BSS/MFT who lack a demonstrable germline CYLD mutation. Further studies are needed to explain the reasons for this phenomenon.</text></passage></document><document><id>1827</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>PAX6 mutations reviewed. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>25</offset><text>Mutations in PAX6 are responsible for human aniridia and have also been found in patients with Peters anomaly , with congenital cataracts , with autosomal dominant keratitis , and with isolated foveal hypoplasia .

In a family-based analysis by The International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG), the G84E mutation was most prevalent in families from the Nordic countries of Finland (22.4%) and Sweden (8.2%). METHODS: To further investigate the importance of G84E in the Finns, we determined its frequency in more than 4,000 prostate cancer cases and 5,000 controls. In addition, 986 breast cancer and 442 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases were studied. Genotyping was conducted using TaqMan, MassARRAY iPLEX, and sequencing. Statistical analyses were conducted using Fisher exact test, and overall survival was analyzed using Cox modeling. RESULTS: The frequency of the G84E mutation was significantly higher among patients with prostate cancer and highest among patients with a family history of the disease, hereditary prostate cancer [8.4% vs. 1.0% in controls; OR 8.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.9-15.7]. The mutation contributed significantly to younger age ( &lt;=55 years) at onset and high prostate-specific antigen (PSA; >= 20 ng/mL) at diagnosis. An association with increased prostate cancer risk in patients with prior benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) diagnosis was also revealed. No statistically significant evidence for a contribution in CRC risk was detected, but a suggestive role for the mutation was observed in familial BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm an increased cancer risk associated with the G84E mutation in the Finnish population, particularly for early-onset prostate cancer and cases with substantially elevated PSA. IMPACT: This study confirms the overall importance of the HOXB13 G84E mutation in prostate cancer susceptibility.</text></passage></document><document><id>1832</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Change in prevalence of congenital defects in children with Prader-Willi syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of congenital defects observed in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and to compare this prevalence with that described in the general population. In addition, these findings were correlated with the different etiologic subtypes. METHODS: A total of 180 children with PWS followed for 13 years were included in this study. Diagnosis was confirmed by the methylation test, and genetic subtypes were established by using fluorescence in situ hybridization or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and microsatellite analyses. The prevalence of congenital defects was compared with national and international registries of congenital defects in the general population (Estudio Colaborativo Latinoamericano de Malformaciones Cong  nitas, European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies, and the New York Registry). RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of the patients presented congenital defects with a risk of 5.4 to 18.7 times higher than that of the general population. The most frequent congenital defects were heart defects, renoureteral malformations, vertebral anomalies, hip dysplasia, clubfoot, and agenesis/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Each of these congenital defects was significantly more frequent in the children with PWS than in the general population. The congenital heart defects were more frequent in girls than in boys with PWS. No significant differences were found when the defects were correlated with the different etiologic subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: An increased prevalence of congenital defects was found in our PWS patients. This finding suggests the need for further studies in PWS children that allow physicians to detect the congenital defects found in this series and, thus, to anticipate complications, with the ultimate aim of enhancing the management of PWS patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>1833</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An intronic polymorphic deletion in the PTEN gene: implications for molecular diagnostic testing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset><text>BACKGROUND: A cohort of 629 patients with suspected Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome or Cowden syndrome was tested for mutations in the PTEN gene. METHODS: Dosage analysis of PTEN was carried out using a PTEN-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) kit, whereas point mutation analysis was performed using direct sequencing. RESULTS: Approximately 4% of the patients from the testing cohort were heterozygously deleted for the two MLPA probe-binding sites situated in intron 1. The same deletion was subsequently seen in    3% of 220 normal controls, and in patients from the testing cohort with a causative mutation elsewhere in the PTEN gene. Sequencing of the variant revealed an 899 bp deletion, the 3' breakpoint of which is only 58 bp from the start of exon 2. CONCLUSION: Although all evidence suggests that the 899 bp deletion is a polymorphism with no clinical effect, it removes the binding sites of almost all published PTEN exon 2 forward primers, resulting in allelic loss during PCR.</text></passage></document><document><id>1834</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mechanisms Regulating Microtubule Binding, DNA Replication, and Apoptosis are Controlled by the Intestinal Tumor Suppressor APC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>129</offset><text>Colorectal cancer (CRC) results from the progressive accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the transformation of normal colorectal epithelium to benign (adenoma) and invasive (carcinoma) disease.

The disorder has a highly complex, largely genetic etiology, involving an impressive variety of genes, the precise contributions of which still remain to be determined. For this reason, a reductionist approach to the study of autism has been proposed, employing monogenic animal models of social dysfunction, either by targeting a candidate gene, or by mimicking a single-gene disorder characterized by autistic symptoms. In the present review, we discuss this monogenic approach by comparing examples of each strategy: the mu opioid receptor knock-out (KO) mouse line, which targets the opioid system (known to be involved in the control of social behaviors); and the Fmr1-KO mouse, a model for Fragile X syndrome (a neurodevelopmental syndrome that includes autistic symptoms). The autistic-relevant behavioral phenotypes of the mu-opioid and Fmr1-KO mouse lines are described here, summarizing previous work by our research group and others, but also providing novel experimental evidence. Relevant factors influencing the validity of the two models, such as sex differences and age at testing, are also addressed, permitting an extensive evaluation of the advantages and limits of monogenic mouse models for autism.</text></passage></document><document><id>1836</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>CHEK2 1100DELC germline mutation: a frequency study in hereditary breast and colon cancer Brazilian families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset><text>CONTEXT: CHEK2 encodes a cell cycle checkpoint kinase that plays an important role in the DNA damage repair pathway, activated mainly by ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) in response to double-stranded DNA breaks. A germline mutation in CHEK2, 1100delC, has been described as a low penetrance allele in a significant number of families with breast and colorectal cancer in certain countries and is also associated with increased risk of contralateral breast cancer in women previously affected by the disease. About 5%-10% of all breast and colorectal cancers are associated with hereditary predisposition and its recognition is of great importance for genetic counseling and cancer risk management. OBJECTIVES: Here, we have assessed the frequency of the CHEK2 1100delC mutation in the germline of 59 unrelated Brazilian individuals with clinical criteria for the hereditary breast and colorectal cancer syndrome. METHODS: A long-range PCR strategy followed by gene sequencing was used. RESULTS: The 1100delC mutation was encountered in the germline of one (1.7%) individual in this high risk cohort. This indicates that the CHEK2 1100delC is not commonly encountered in Brazilian families with multiple diagnoses of breast and colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: These results should be confirmed in a larger series of families and further testing should be undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the hereditary breast and colorectal cancer phenotype.</text></passage></document><document><id>1837</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The chromatin remodeling protein BRG1 modulates BRCA1 response to UV irradiation by regulating ATR/ATM activation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>115</offset><text>The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a role in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. It was proposed that chromatin remodeling activities are utilized to increase the accessibility of nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery and checkpoint factors to the damaged DNA. It was shown recently that BRCA1 contributes to UV damage response by promoting photoproduct excision, triggering post-UV checkpoint activation and post-replicative repair. In this study, we show that BRCA1 rapidly binds to UV damage sites when cells are undergoing DNA synthesis. In contrast, two phosphorylated forms of BRCA1 do not accumulate at sites of UV damage. Depletion of BRG1, a core subunit of the human SWI/SNF-BAF complex, impairs the recruitment of BRCA1 to the damage sites and attenuates DNA damage induced BRCA1 phosphorylation. At UV lesions-stalled replication forks, BRG1 promotes RPA phosphorylation in response to UV irradiation, since UV-induced phosphorylation of chromatin bound RPA drops significantly when BRG1 is depleted in human cells. Importantly, activation of the ATM/ATR kinases is attenuated when BRG1 is depleted. We propose that BRG1 modulates BRCA1 response to UV irradiation by regulating ATM/ATR activation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1838</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>SWS (blue) cone hypersensitivity in a newly identified retinal degeneration.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>Photoreceptor-mediated mechanisms were studied in patients with a recently identified retinopathy typified by night blindness, cystoid maculopathy, and similar scotopic and photopic electroretinograms (ERGs). Dark-adapted spectral sensitivity functions were only partly explained as composites of rod and cone curves shifted to lower sensitivities; there was unusually high sensitivity from 400-460 nm. A rod mechanism, reduced in sensitivity by at least 3 log units, was detectable with dark adaptometry. No measurable rhodopsin was found with fundus reflectometry. Light-adapted spectral sensitivities were subnormal for wavelengths greater than 500 nm but supernormal from 420-460 nm. On a yellow adapting field, the supernormal spectrum approximated that of the short-wavelength-sensitive (SWS) cone system. With spectral ERGs, two mechanisms were demonstrated. Dark- and light-adapted ERGs to green, orange-yellow, and red stimuli had similar waveforms and coincident intensity-response functions on a photopic intensity axis. ERGs to blue and blue-green stimuli were similar, and intensity-response functions coincided on a SWS cone intensity axis. Patients varied in the degree to which rod and midspectral cone function were decreased and SWS cone function was increased.</text></passage></document><document><id>1839</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nav 1.4 slow-inactivation: is it a player in the warm-up phenomenon of myotonic disorders?</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>Myotonia is a heritable disorder in which patients are unable to willfully relax their muscles.

What is unclear is how normal muscle function can temporarily return with repeated movement, the so-called "warm-up" phenomenon. Electrophysiological analyses of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1.4 (gene name SCN4A), a key player in myotonia, have revealed several parallels between the Nav 1.4 biophysical signature, specifically slow-inactivation, and myotonic warm-up, which suggest that Nav 1.4 is critical not only in producing the myotonic reaction, but also in mediating the warm-up.</text></passage></document><document><id>1840</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>TCTP increases stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a by interaction with and degradation of the tumour suppressor VHL.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) plays an important role in maintaining cell proliferation and its high expression is associated with many tumours. The tumour suppressor von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) has been shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Although great progress has been made, biological roles of these factors and relevant molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we have shown that TCTP specifically binds to VHL through its b domain and competes with hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1a). TCTP over-expression decreased the protein level of VHL and the inhibition of TCTP expression by miRNA resulted in an increase of the VHL protein level. Moreover, TCTP over-expression promoted the K48-linked ubiquitination of VHL, thus degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In addition, we showed that TCTP increased the protein level of HIF1a, which promoted both vascular endothelial growth factor-hypoxic response element-promoter-driven luciferase reporter and endogenous VEGF expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data have demonstrated that TCTP binds to the b domain of VHL through competition with HIF1a, which promotes VHL degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and HIF1a stability.</text></passage></document><document><id>1841</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel OCRL mutations in Chinese children with Lowe syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>61</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Lowe syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive hereditary disease caused by mutations of the OCRL gene, which encodes an inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase.

Genetic analysis of the OCRL gene was done for the three patients as well as their family members. RESULTS: Three OCRL gene mutations were detected in our study. Two of the mutations, g.1897delT in exon 18 (patient 1) and g.1470delG in exon 15 (patient 2), were novel. A missense mutation (p.Y513C) in exon 15, which had been reported previously, was found in patient 3. The mothers of all patients were heterozygous carriers of the respective mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Three Chinese children were diagnosed with Lowe syndrome through clinical and genetic analyses.

Their mutation rate is known to be high when C is present as 5-methyl-cytosine, but is believed to be normal when it is unmethylated. The beta-globin gene contains five, the gamma-globin gene two, and each of the alpha-globin genes contains 35 CpG dinucleotides. The CpG dinucleotides in the beta and gamma-globin genes are methylated, while those in the alpha-globin genes are under-methylated. One would therefore have expected the CpG dinucleotides to be a frequent source of mutations in the beta and gamma-globin genes, but not in the alpha-globin genes. In fact, the evidence points to CpG dinucleotides being a frequent source of mutations in both the alpha and beta-globin genes. This suggests either that the mutation rates of both methylated and unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are abnormally high, which conflicts with published evidence, or that there is a finite chance of some of these in the alpha-globin genes of certain individuals being methylated and therefore subject to mutation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1847</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The RB1 gene mutation in a child with ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>75</offset><text>The RB1 gene mutation was investigated in a child with ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma using DNA obtained from both the pineal and retinal tumours of the patient .

In humans, homozygous carriers of a "pain-protective" (PP) haplotype of the GCH1 gene have been identified exhibiting lower pain sensitivity, but only following pain sensitisation. Ex vivo, the PP GCH1 haplotype is associated with decreased induction of GCH1 after stimulation, whereas the baseline BH4 production is not affected. Contrary, loss of function mutations in the GCH1 gene results in decreased basal GCH1 expression, and is associated with DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD). So far it is unknown if such mutations affect acute and inflammatory pain. RESULTS: In the current study, we examined the involvement of the GCH1 gene in pain models using the hyperphenylalaninemia 1 (hph-1) mouse, a genetic model for DRD, with only 10% basal GTP-CH1 activity compared to wild type mice. The study included assays for determination of acute nociception as well as models for pain after sensitisation. Pain behavioural analysis of the hph-1 mice showed reduced pain-like responses following intraplantar injection of CFA, formalin and capsaicin; whereas decreased basal level of GTP-CH1 activity had no influence in na  ve hph-1 mice on acute mechanical and heat pain thresholds. Moreover, the hph-1 mice showed no signs of motor impairment or dystonia-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrate novel evidence that genetic mutations in the GCH1 gene modulate pain-like hypersensitivity. Together, the present data suggest that BH4 is not important for basal heat and mechanical pain, but they support the hypothesis that BH4 plays a role in inflammation-induced hypersensitivity. Our studies suggest that the BH4 pathway could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory pain conditions. Moreover, the hph-1 mice provide a valid model to study the consequence of congenital deficiency of GCH1 in painful conditions.</text></passage></document><document><id>1849</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of renal cell carcinomas in patients with von Hippel Lindau disease: indications, techniques, complications, and outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>160</offset><text>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease tends to be multifocal, bilateral, and recur or develop new tumors after removal.

[Bourbon et al., J. Mol. Biol. 200 (1988) 627-638]. In both murine species the genomic organization has been strikingly conserved during evolution, i.e., the coding region extends over 9 kb and is split into 14 exons, encoding a 712-amino acid protein. Moreover, all the exon-intron junction positions were strictly maintained during evolution. More unexpectedly, this analysis revealed that several introns contain highly conserved sequence elements of about 120 nt. The nt sequence of the homologous locus isolated from a Chinese hamster genomic clone established that these regions were under unusually high selective constraints (84-96% identity between the hamster and murine nuc genes) and, although they do not contain open reading frames, they surprisingly appear to be more conserved than most of the exons, suggesting that they play an important role. Such an element of 130 nt presents features of known genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Furthermore, in the rat nuc pre-mRNA the 5'- and 3'-end regions of the last intron are fully complementary over 16 nt, and so are predicted to be included in a prominent stem structure. Moreover, an homologous RNA stem structure can be derived from the mouse sequence, including two compensatory nt changes. As the secondary structure would occlude the canonical sequences required for the proper excision of this intron in both murine species, this remarkable finding could be relevant to the regulation of the nuc gene expression at the RNA processing level.</text></passage></document><document><id>1853</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Neonatal nonketotic hyperglycinemia: a case study and review of management for the advanced practice nurse.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of glycine metabolism.

Previous work shows that mutation of both alleles of the RB1 retinoblastoma suppressor gene initiates disease. We aimed to characterise non-familial retinoblastoma tumours with no detectable RB1 mutations. METHODS: Of 1068 unilateral non-familial retinoblastoma tumours, we compared those with no evidence of RB1 mutations (RB1(+/+)) with tumours carrying a mutation in both alleles (RB1(-/-)). We analysed genomic copy number, RB1 gene expression and protein function, retinal gene expression, histological features, and clinical data. FINDINGS: No RB1 mutations (RB1(+/+)) were reported in 29 (2  7%) of 1068 unilateral retinoblastoma tumours. 15 of the 29 RB1(+/+) tumours had high-level MYCN oncogene amplification (28-121 copies; RB1(+/+)MYCN(A)), whereas none of 93 RB1(-/-) primary tumours tested showed MYCN amplification (p&lt;0  0001). RB1(+/+)MYCN(A) tumours expressed functional RB1 protein, had fewer overall genomic copy-number changes in genes characteristic of retinoblastoma than did RB1(-/-) tumours, and showed distinct aggressive histological features. MYCN amplification was the sole copy-number change in one RB1(+/+)MYCN(A) retinoblastoma. One additional MYCN(A) tumour was discovered after the initial frequencies were determined, and this is included in further analyses. Median age at diagnosis of the 17 children with RB1(+/+)MYCN(A) tumours was 4  5 months (IQR 3  5-10), compared with 24 months (15-37) for 79 children with non-familial unilateral RB1(-/-) retinoblastoma. INTERPRETATION: Amplification of the MYCN oncogene might initiate retinoblastoma in the presence of non-mutated RB1 genes. These unilateral RB1(+/+)MYCN(A) retinoblastomas are characterised by distinct histological features, only a few of the genomic copy-number changes that are characteristic of retinoblastoma, and very early age of diagnosis.

Nonpulmonary anomalies involving organs of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems have been identified in approximately 80% of patients with ACD/MPV. We have collected DNA and pathological samples from more than 90 infants with ACD/MPV and their family members. Since the publication of our initial report of four point mutations and 10 deletions, we have identified an additional 38 novel nonsynonymous mutations of FOXF1 (nine nonsense, seven frameshift, one inframe deletion, 20 missense, and one no stop). This report represents an up to date list of all known FOXF1 mutations to the best of our knowledge. Majority of the cases are sporadic. We report four familial cases of which three show maternal inheritance, consistent with paternal imprinting of the gene. Twenty five mutations (60%) are located within the putative DNA-binding domain, indicating its plausible role in FOXF1 function. Five mutations map to the second exon. We identified two additional genic and eight genomic deletions upstream to FOXF1. These results corroborate and extend our previous observations and further establish involvement of FOXF1 in ACD/MPV and lung organogenesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1859</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Late-onset skin fragility in childhood: a case of junctional epidermolysis bullosa of late onset caused by a missense mutation in COL17A1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>139</offset></passage></document><document><id>1860</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Clinical significance of the fifth component of complement analysis].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>71</offset></passage></document><document><id>1861</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An Italian cohort study identifies four new pathologic mutations in the ARSA gene.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>83</offset><text>Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder of the myelin metabolism due to the impaired function of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A. Three major clinical variants of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) have been described: late infantile, juvenile, and late onset. The infantile form, whose clinical onset is usually before the age of 2  years, is the most frequent. The juvenile form manifests itself between 3 and 16  years and the late-onset form manifests at any time after puberty. As of today, more than 150 mutations causing MLD have been identified in the ARSA gene that encodes arylsulfatase A. In this paper, we report our experience with the diagnosis of MLD in seven Italian patients from unrelated families. We found 11 different mutations, four of which have not been previously described: c.1215_1223del9 (p.406_408del), c.601  T>C (p.Tyr201His), c.655  T>A (p.Phe219Ile), and c.87C>A (p.Asp29Glu). Our data show once more that there are still several mutations to be discovered in the ARSA gene and there are rarely repeating ones found in the population. The predictive value of the enzyme activity tests in regard to clinical manifestations is extremely limited.</text></passage></document><document><id>1862</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia in a Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)-Deficient Geriatric Trauma Patient.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>120</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic enzymatic disorder causing hemolytic anemia. Exposure to drugs is considered to be the most common cause of acute hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Experience with regional anesthesia, in particular peripheral nerve blocks, is rarely described in patients with G6PD deficiency, but is of great clinical interest. For this reason, we now report on the successful management of ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block in a patient with geriatric G6PD deficiency. CASE REPORT: A female, 75-year-old geriatric trauma patient with G6PD deficiency and a fracture of the left forearm, was scheduled for osteosynthesis of the left forearm. For surgery regional anesthesia with ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block with 30 mL bupivacaine 0.5% was established. Surgical operation und postoperative course were uneventful and with no signs of hemolysis. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block with bupivacaine was a safe and effective technique in this patient with G6PD deficiency. Peripheral nerve block is a major analgesic approach and of great value for anesthesiologists and surgeons, especially in our aging and multimorbid society.</text></passage></document><document><id>1863</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Germline mutations in the 3' part of APC exon 15 do not result in truncated proteins and are associated with attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>148</offset><text>Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps predominantly in the colorectal region .

Under conditions of oxidative stress, the activation of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) triggers the antioxidant cellular response by inducing antioxidant response element (ARE) driven genes. Increasing evidence supports a role for the Nrf2-ARE pathway in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we analyzed the expression and the distribution of Nrf2 in silenced neurons for frataxin gene. Decreased Nrf2 mRNA content and a defective activation after treatment with pro-oxidants have been evidenced in frataxin-silenced neurons by RT-PCR and confocal microscopy. The loss of Nrf2 in FRDA may greatly enhance the cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress and make FRDA neurons more vulnerable to injury. Our findings may help to focus on this promising target, especially in its emerging role in the neuroprotective response.</text></passage></document><document><id>1865</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Iron storage disease in Asia-Pacific populations: the importance of non-HFE mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>87</offset><text>Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a widely recognized and well-studied condition in European populations.

Mutations in all of the currently known genes implicated in non-HFE HH (hemojuvelin, hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2, and ferroportin) have been reported in patients from the Asia-Pacific region. This review discusses the molecular basis of HH and the genes and mutations known to cause non-HFE HH with particular reference to the Asia-Pacific region.

RBCs are extremely deformable and elastic, as they are exposed to shear forces as they travel through the vascular system. In inflammatory conditions, and in the presence of hydroxyl radicals, RBCs loose their discoid shape. Here, ultrastructure of RBCs is studied using a scanning electron microscope, and we determine how fast changes in healthy individuals are noted after exposure to iron and glucose. We compare shape changes in these experiments to RBCs from diabetic and hemochromatosis patients (wild type, as well as hereditary hemochromatosis with mutations H63D/H63D, C282Y/C282Y, H63D/C282Y, C282Y/wild type and H63D/wild type). Thrombin is also added to whole blood exposed to iron, glucose and blood from diabetes and hemochromatosis patients. RBCs are easily deformed to a pointed shape in smears, and, with the addition of thrombin they are entrapped in the fibrin mesh of dense matted fibrin deposits. This entrapping causes severe shape changes due to the pressure of the fibrin onto the stressed cells. The most important observation of the current research is therefore how fast RBC can adapt in a changed environment and that the pressure of fibrin fibers may trap the RBC tightly in the resulting clot.</text></passage></document><document><id>1867</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular analyses of a Lesch-Nyhan syndrome mutation (hprtMontreal) by use of T-lymphocyte cultures.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>102</offset><text>The frequency of hprt mutants in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes of two putative Lesch-Nyhan individuals and their parents was determined by a cell cloning assay to quantify the frequency of thioguanine-resistant mutants.

Mass cultures of T-lymphocytes from both the children and their mother, as well as cultures of hprt mutant clones from the mother, were employed as sources of mRNA for cDNA sequence analysis. These hprt mutants show a single base substitution (T----C transition) at position 170 (exon 3). The predicted amino acid change is the substitution of threonine for methionine56.

The homology of CHS in humans and cats has been demonstrated. Since human CHS is a progressive, serious, and eventually fatal disease, a method for prenatal diagnosis would be desirable. This study was designed to determine whether CHS could be diagnosed prenatally by examination of amniotic fluid cells. The amniotic fluid samples were obtained from CHS and control cat fetuses on the 45th day of gestation and cultures of cells were established. Because the underlying enzyme deficiency in CHS has not been identified, it was necessary to use a secondary manifestation of the syndrome in these studies. The secondary manifestation used was the characteristic enlargement of lysosomes associated with the disease. The lysosomes of these cells were stained by acid phosphatase histochemistry and the diameter of the largest lysosome in each cell was measured by light microscopy with a calibrated ocular micrometer. The diameters of the largest lysosomes in cells of normal fetuses ranged from 0.5 to 7.0 micron (means ranged from 0.9 to 1.8 micron), whereas the diameter of the largest lysosomes in the cells of CHS fetuses ranged from 0.5 to 30 microns (means ranged from 6.4 to 12.8 microns). The approximate t-test for independent samples with unequal variances disclosed that the largest acid phosphatase-positive lysosomes in amniotic fluid cells of CHS cat fetuses were significantly larger than the lysosomes in the cells of normal cat fetuses (P less than 0.0001). This information should, by extrapolation, provide the basis for the prenatal diagnosis of human CHS by amniocentesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1873</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms and phenotypic analysis of cytochrome P450 2D6 in the Tibetan population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>The cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme (CYP2D6) metabolizes about 25% of prescribed drugs in the endoplasmic reticulum, and genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can greatly affect its activity and lead to differences among individuals in drug efficacy and adverse drug reactions. To investigate genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 among Tibetan Chinese, we directly sequenced the whole gene in 96 unrelated, healthy Tibetans from The Tibet Autonomous Region of China and screened for genetic variants in the promoter, exons, introns, and 3'UTR. We detected fifty-one genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, and 16 of them are novel. The allele frequencies of CYP2D6*1, *2, *5, *10, *41, and *49 were 0.25, 0.43, 0.02, 0.29, 0.02, and 0.01, respectively. The frequency of CYP2D6*10, a putative poor-metabolizer allele, was lower in our sample population compared with that in the Han Chinese population (p&lt;0.001). In addition, haplotype analysis allowed 15 CYP2D6 haplotypes to be classified into three groups. In conclusion, our results provide basic information about CPY2D6 alleles in Tibetans and suggest that the enzymatic activities of CYP2D6 may differ among the diverse ethnic populations of China. Our results provide a basis for safer drug administration and better therapeutic treatment among Tibetans.</text></passage></document><document><id>1874</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The melanocortin system and insulin resistance in humans: insights from a patient with complete POMC deficiency and type 1 diabetes mellitus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>142</offset><text>The central melanocortin system is essential for the regulation of long-term energy homeostasis in humans.

We here describe the eighth individual with complete proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency and the first with coincidental concomitant type 1 diabetes, which provides a unique opportunity to determine the role of melanocortins in glucose homeostasis in human. Direct sequencing of the POMC gene in this severely obese patient with isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency identified a homozygous 5' untranslated region mutation -11C>A, which we find to abolish normal POMC protein synthesis, as assessed in vitro.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy participants received a daily dose of CETP inhibitor (n=10) or placebo (n=15) for 14 days in a randomized double-blind study. Insulin secretion and cholesterol efflux from MIN6N8 b-cells were determined after incubation with treated plasma. CETP inhibition increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI, and postprandial insulin. MIN6N8 b-cells incubated with plasma from CETP inhibitor-treated individuals (compared with placebo) exhibited an increase in both glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cholesterol efflux over the 14-day treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: CETP inhibition increased postprandial insulin and promoted ex vivo b-cell glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, potentially via enhanced b-cell cholesterol efflux.</text></passage></document><document><id>1876</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Frequent inactivation of PTEN/MMAC1 in primary prostate cancer. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>64</offset><text>Sporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the Western world , yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated .

This gene codes for acid ceramidase, a lysosomal heterodimeric enzyme that hydrolyzes ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acid. To date, less than 25 distinct mutations have been identified in Farber patients, but no large deletions have yet been reported. In this work, cultured fibroblasts from a Farber patient with the rare neonatal form of Farber disease were studied to elucidate the molecular basis of this extremely severe phenotype. Direct sequencing of ASAH1 genomic DNA revealed the causative heterozygous mutation in the donor splice site consensus sequence of intron 11, g.24491A > G (c.917 + 4A > G), that resulted in the absence of detectable mRNA. Subsequent analysis of ASAH1 mRNA showed total skipping of exons 3 to 5. Long-range PCR and sequencing led to the identification of a gross deletion of ASAH1 gene, g.8728_18197del (c.126-3941_382 + 1358del) predicting the synthesis of a truncated polypeptide, p.Tyr42_Leu127delinsArgfs*10. Accordingly, no molecular forms corresponding to precursor or proteolytically processed mature protein were observed. These findings indicate that any functionally active acid ceramidase is absent in patient cells, underscoring the severity of the clinical phenotype. Molecular findings in the non-consanguineous parents confirmed the compound heterozygous ASAH1 genotype identified in this Farber case. This work unravels for the first time the mutations underlying the neonatal form of Farber disease and represents the first report of a large deletion identified in the ASAH1 gene. Screening for gross deletions in other patients in whom the mutation present in the second allele had not yet been identified is required to elucidate further its overall contribution for the molecular pathogenesis of this devastating disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1879</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Linking distant relatives with BRCA gene mutations: potential for cost savings.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Thousands of individuals have undergone mutational analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2.

We hypothesized that some of the rarer recurrent mutations observed in our population were due to different branches of the same family being tested independently without knowledge of previous testing of relatives. We examined 90 pedigrees for individuals with the same mutations that were seen three or more times for shared reported family medical history or surnames. Familial links were made in four instances out of a total of 22 shared mutations despite the fact that individuals were not aware that another family member had been tested.

In this review, we are mainly focusing on the contribution of BRCA1/2 sequence variations to prostate cancer risk and disease progression. We will discuss the biological functions of BRCA1/2 and BRCA1/2-related signaling pathways in prostate cancer biology. The majority of studies supporting the link between BRCA1/2 mutations and prostate cancer are from populations with a high frequency of mutations, such as Ashkenazi Jewish, Icelandic, and U.K. population. BRCA1 can directly interact with the androgen receptor (AR) and Janus kinase (JAK), and can differentially regulate insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) expression in an AR-dependent manner. BRCA2 homeostasis in prostate cancer cells has been found to be critical in determining cell fates during prostate cancer progression.

It is thought that most of these variants have gene regulatory functions, but their precise roles in disease susceptibility are not well understood. Common variants account for only a small percentage of the risk of disease because they have low penetrance. Collectively, the breast cancer genes identified to date contribute only ~30% of the familial risk. Therefore, there is much interest in accounting for the missing heritability, and possible sources include loss of information through ignoring phenotype heterogeneity (disease subtypes have genetic differences), gene-gene and gene-environment interaction, and rarer forms of variation. Identification of these rarer variations in coding regions is now feasible and cost effective through exome sequencing, which has already identified high-penetrance variants for some rare diseases. Targeting more 'extreme' breast cancer phenotypes, particularly cases with early-onset disease, a strong family history (not accounted for by BRCA mutations), and with specific tumor subtypes, provides a route to progress using next-generation sequencing methods.</text></passage></document><document><id>1885</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A comparison of the detection of BRCA mutation carriers through the provision of Jewish population-based genetic testing compared with clinic-based genetic testing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>165</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Guidelines for genetic testing for BRCA1 or BRCA2 stipulate that a personal or family history of cancer is necessary to be eligible for testing. Approximately 2% of Ashkenazi Jewish women carry a mutation, but to date population-based testing has not been advocated. Little is known about the relative yield of a conventional genetic testing programme versus a programme of widespread testing in a population with common founder mutations. METHODS: We provided both referral-based and Jewish population-based testing between 2008 and 2012. We compared the numbers of BRCA mutation carriers identified through the two streams and estimated the number of genetic counselling hours devoted to each programme. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2012, 38 female carriers were identified through 487 referrals to our genetics centre (29 unaffected with cancer). During the same time, 6179 Jewish women were tested through our population-based programme and 93 mutation carriers were identified (92 unaffected with cancer). Fewer counsellor hours were devoted to the population-based than to the clinical referral-based testing programme. CONCLUSION: Genetic testing of all Jewish women above the age of 25 years will greatly expand the number of BRCA mutation carriers identified without a commensurate increase in the number of hours required for counselling.</text></passage></document><document><id>1886</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Human MLH1 deficiency predisposes to hematological malignancy and neurofibromatosis type 1. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>92</offset><text>Heterozygous germ-line mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes lead to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer .

Numerous mutant hNav1.5 channels have been characterized upon heterologous expression and patch-clamp recordings during the last decade. These studies revealed functionally important regions in hNav1.5 and provided insight into gain-of-function or loss-of-function channel defects underlying LQT3 or BrS, respectively. The N-terminal region of hNav1.5, however, has not yet been investigated in detail, although several mutations were reported in the literature. In the present study we investigated three mutant channels, previously associated with LQT3 (G9V, R18W, V125L), and six mutant channels, associated with BrS (R18Q, R27H, G35S, V95I, R104Q, K126E). We applied both the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique, using cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes, and the whole-cell patch clamp technique using transfected HEK293 cells. Surprisingly, four out of the nine mutations did not affect channel properties. Gain-of-function, as typically observed in LQT3 mutant channels, was observed only in R18W and V125L, whereas loss-of-function, frequently found in BrS mutants, was found only in R27H, R104Q, and K126E. Our results indicate that the hNav1.5 N-terminus plays an important role for channel kinetics and stability. At the same time, we suggest that additional mechanisms, as e.g., disturbed interactions of the Na(+) channel N-terminus with other proteins, contribute to severe clinical phenotypes.</text></passage></document><document><id>1888</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>TM4SF20 ancestral deletion and susceptibility to a pediatric disorder of early language delay and cerebral white matter hyperintensities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>138</offset><text>White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) of the brain are important markers of aging and small-vessel disease. WMHs are rare in healthy children and, when observed, often occur with comorbid neuroinflammatory or vasculitic processes. Here, we describe a complex 4 kb deletion in 2q36.3 that segregates with early childhood communication disorders and WMH in 15 unrelated families predominantly from Southeast Asia. The premature brain aging phenotype with punctate and multifocal WMHs was observed in ~70% of young carrier parents who underwent brain MRI. The complex deletion removes the penultimate exon 3 of TM4SF20, a gene encoding a transmembrane protein of unknown function. Minigene analysis showed that the resultant net loss of an exon introduces a premature stop codon, which, in turn, leads to the generation of a stable protein that fails to target to the plasma membrane and accumulates in the cytoplasm. Finally, we report this deletion to be enriched in individuals of Vietnamese Kinh descent, with an allele frequency of about 1%, embedded in an ancestral haplotype. Our data point to a constellation of early language delay and WMH phenotypes, driven by a likely toxic mechanism of TM4SF20 truncation, and highlight the importance of understanding and managing population-specific low-frequency pathogenic alleles.</text></passage></document><document><id>1889</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The assignment of the genes coding for human complement components C6 and C7 to chromosome 5.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>A panel of 19 somatic cell hybrids was tested for the presence of human sequences coding for complement components C6 and C7 by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blots probed with human C6 and C7 cDNA probes.

One of the best characterized ataxin-1 functional partners is Capicua (CIC), a transcriptional repressor involved in signalling pathways that regulate mammalian development, tumorigenesis and, through the interaction with ataxin-1, also neurodegeneration. Complex formation of ataxin-1 with CIC is important both for the function of the wild-type protein and for pathogenesis as transcriptional disregulation is observed since the early stages of the development of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare disease severity between adult FMF patients in Turkey (TR) and Germany (G). METHODS: Adult FMF patients of Turkish ancestry on colchicine living in Turkey (n = 40) or G (n = 35) were compared. Disease severity, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were assessed. RESULTS: Groups differed significantly in the following aspects: age at onset of disease (TR: 15.6, G: 10.8 years; P = 0.02), delay between onset and initiation of colchicine treatment (TR: 6.8 years, G: 14.9 years; P &lt; 0.001), female gender (TR: 80%, G: 57.1%; P = 0.04), and duration of disease (TR: 14.4 years, G: 23.4 years; P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in colchicine treatment concerning average dosing and duration of therapy. No significant difference could be found between the 2 groups in CRP and disease severity as assessed by the score of Pras et al. (Am J Med Genet. 1998;75:216-219) even after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate was significantly higher among patients living in G (TR: 13.2 mm/first hour, G: 26.3 mm/first hour; P &lt; 0.001). Among patients living in Germany, there was a significant difference in age at FMF onset depending on their country of birth (born in TR: 14.9 years, born in G: 6.9 years; P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In adult FMF patients living in Turkey or Germany, no difference in disease activity or CRP could be found. German patients were younger at onset of disease and had a longer delay between onset and initiation of colchicine treatment.</text></passage></document><document><id>1896</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>High school Tay-Sachs disease carrier screening: 5 to 11-year follow-up.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>The Melbourne high school Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carrier screening program began in 1997. The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of this screening program among those who had testing more than 5  years ago, to evaluate the long-term impact of screening. A questionnaire was used for data collection and consisted of validated scales and purposively designed questions. Questionnaires were sent to all carriers and two non-carriers for each carrier who were screened in the program between 1999 and 2005. Twenty-four out of 69 (34.8  %) carriers and 30/138 (21.7  %) non-carriers completed the questionnaire. Most participants (82  %) retained good knowledge of TSD and there was no evidence of a difference in knowledge between carriers and non-carriers. Most participants (83  %) were happy with the timing and setting of screening and thought that education and screening for TSD should be offered during high school. There was no difference between carriers and non-carriers in mean scores for the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and Decision Regret Scale. This evaluation indicated that 5-11  years post high school screening, those who were screened are supportive of the program and that negative consequences are rare.</text></passage></document><document><id>1897</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Redox-regulated cargo binding and release by the peroxisomal targeting signal receptor, Pex5.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>94</offset><text>In its role as a mobile receptor for peroxisomal matrix cargo containing a peroxisomal targeting signal called PTS1, the protein Pex5 shuttles between the cytosol and the peroxisome lumen. Pex5 binds PTS1 proteins in the cytosol via its C-terminal tetratricopeptide domains and delivers them to the peroxisome lumen, where the receptor  cargo complex dissociates. The cargo-free receptor is exported to the cytosol for another round of import. How cargo release and receptor recycling are regulated is poorly understood. We found that Pex5 functions as a dimer/oligomer and that its protein interactions with itself (homo-oligomeric) and with Pex8 (hetero-oligomeric) control the binding and release of cargo proteins. These interactions are controlled by a redox-sensitive amino acid, cysteine 10 of Pex5, which is essential for the formation of disulfide bond-linked Pex5 forms, for high affinity cargo binding, and for receptor recycling. Disulfide bond-linked Pex5 showed the highest affinity for PTS1 cargo. Upon reduction of the disulfide bond by dithiothreitol, Pex5 transitioned to a noncovalent dimer, concomitant with the partial release of PTS1 cargo. Additionally, dissipation of the redox balance between the cytosol and the peroxisome lumen caused an import defect. A hetero-oligomeric interaction between the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-110) of Pex5 and a conserved motif at the C terminus of Pex8 further facilitates cargo release, but only under reducing conditions. This interaction is also important for the release of PTS1 proteins. We suggest a redox-regulated model for Pex5 function during the peroxisomal matrix protein import cycle.</text></passage></document><document><id>1898</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Characterization of variants in the glucosylceramide synthase gene and their association with type 1 Gaucher disease severity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>The extreme phenotypic variability of patients with Gaucher disease (GD) is not completely explained by glucocerebrosidase gene mutations.

Five UGCG variants were significantly associated with disease severity, according to the DS3 scoring system: c.-295C>T, c.-232_-241ins10, c.98+50A>G, c.98+68A>T, and c.861A>G.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis showed an increased nuclear protein binding ability for the G allele at the cDNA position c.98+50, as well as an altered pattern for the c.-232_-241ins10 allele. The promoter activity of the haplotypes decreased significantly with respect to wild type activity in HepG2 and COS-7 cells (-14% and -16% for the c.[-232_-241ins10;98+50A] haplotype, -44% and -25% for c.[-222nonins;98+50G] haplotypes, and -64% and -75% for c.[-232_-241ins10;98+50G] haplotype, respectively).

B chromosomes are additional to standard karyotypes and may vary in size, number and morphology even between cells of the same individual. For many years it was generally believed that B chromosomes found in some plant, animal and fungi species lacked active genes. Recently, molecular cytogenetic studies showed the presence of additional copies of protein-coding genes on B chromosomes. However, the transcriptional activity of these genes remained elusive. We studied karyotypes of the Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) that possess up to 14 B chromosomes to investigate the presence and expression of genes on supernumerary chromosomes. RESULTS: Here, we describe a 2 Mbp region homologous to cattle chromosome 3 and containing TNNI3K (partial), FPGT, LRRIQ3 and a large gene-sparse segment on B chromosomes of the Siberian roe deer. The presence of the copy of the autosomal region was demonstrated by B-specific cDNA analysis, PCR assisted mapping, cattle bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone localization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). By comparative analysis of B-specific and non-B chromosomal sequences we discovered some B chromosome-specific mutations in protein-coding genes, which further enabled the detection of a FPGT-TNNI3K transcript expressed from duplicated genes located on B chromosomes in roe deer fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Discovery of a large autosomal segment in all B chromosomes of the Siberian roe deer further corroborates the view of an autosomal origin for these elements. Detection of a B-derived transcript in fibroblasts implies that the protein coding sequences located on Bs are not fully inactivated. The origin, evolution and effect on host of B chromosomal genes seem to be similar to autosomal segmental duplications, which reinforces the view that supernumerary chromosomal elements might play an important role in genome evolution.</text></passage></document><document><id>1900</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Bioenergetics of the calf muscle in Friedreich ataxia patients measured by 31P-MRS before and after treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>149</offset><text>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a GAA repeat expansion in the FXN gene leading to reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEPO) is suggested to increase frataxin levels, alter mitochondrial function and improve clinical scores in FRDA patients. Aim of the present pilot study was to investigate mitochondrial metabolism of skeletal muscle tissue in FRDA patients and examine effects of rhuEPO administration by phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS). Seven genetically confirmed FRDA patients underwent 31P MRS of the calf muscles using a rest-exercise-recovery protocol before and after receiving 3000 IU of rhuEPO for eight weeks. FRDA patients showed more rapid phosphocreatine (PCr) depletion and increased accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) during incremental exercise as compared to controls. After maximal exhaustive exercise prolonged regeneration of PCR and slowed decline in Pi can be seen in FRDA. PCr regeneration as hallmark of mitochondrial ATP production revealed correlation to activity of complex II/III of the respiratory chain and to demographic values. PCr and Pi kinetics were not influenced by rhuEPO administration. Our results confirm mitochondrial dysfunction and exercise intolerance due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle tissue of FRDA patients. MRS did not show improved mitochondrial bioenergetics after eight weeks of rhuEPO exposition in skeletal muscle tissue of FRDA patients.

Neuropsychological studies suggest that FRDA may be associated with specific cognitive impairment. Very little is known about the relation between cognitive performance, demographics and disease-related parameters, such as GAA repeat size, age of onset and disease duration. The present investigation aimed at assessing cognitive functions in a representative sample of FRDA patients and at identifying the most relevant disease-related parameters. Twenty-nine adult FRDA patients underwent neuropsychological tests assessing executive functions, attention, memory and visual perception. Performance was compared with 28 age- and education-matched controls as well as with standardized norms. The relation between neuropsychological outcome, demographical variables and disease-related parameters was assessed. Cognitive impairment affected only a subgroup of patients and mostly concerned attentional and executive functions. Good cognitive performance was associated with a later disease onset, shorter GAA repeat length and lower burden of disease. Age at disease onset has been found to be a good predictor when a cut-off of 14  years was chosen. No correlation was found between cognitive performance and education, age or disease duration. The present study extends earlier findings in FRDA showing that performance in attentional and executive function tasks is best predicted by the age at disease onset. Moreover, executive functions show a clear relationship to disease severity and repeat size of the shorter GAA allele. These findings therefore have important implications for patient counselling regarding education and career choices.</text></passage></document><document><id>1902</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Identification of novel KIT gene mutations in two Chinese families with piebaldism].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>86</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To screen for potential mutations of KIT gene for two Chinese families affected with piebaldism in order to facilitate genetic counseling and assisted reproduction.

PCR-sequencing and reverse transcription PCR-sequencing were used to screen KIT mutations. RESULTS: All of the patients from family 1 were found to carry heterozygous IVS12+2-+7delinsACATCTTTA, a splicing mutation undocumented in the human gene mutation data base (HGMD) database. This mutation has resulted in c.1765-1779del in cDNA and p.Gly592Ala/del:E12, which has led to skipping of exon 12 and no expression of cDNA.

Mutant ataxin-3, the genetic cause of Machado-Joseph Disease, also contains an expanded CAG repeat. We demonstrate here that ss-siRNAs are allele-selective inhibitors of ataxin-3 expression and then redesign ss-siRNAs to optimize their selectivity. We find that both RNAi-related and non-RNAi-related mechanisms affect gene expression by either blocking translation or affecting alternative splicing. These results have four broad implications: (i) ss-siRNAs will not always behave similarly to analogous RNA duplexes; (ii) the sequences surrounding CAG repeats affect allele-selectivity of anti-CAG oligonucleotides; (iii) ss-siRNAs can function through multiple mechanisms and; and (iv) it is possible to use chemical modification to optimize ss-siRNA properties and improve their potential for drug discovery.</text></passage></document><document><id>1905</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>SETX mutations are a frequent genetic cause of juvenile and adult onset cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>144</offset><text>OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia defines a group of genetically distinct recessive ataxias including ataxia-telangectasia (A-T, ATM gene), ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1, APTX gene) and type 2 (AOA2, SETX gene). Although, a few unique clinical features differentiate each of these forms, the patients also share common clinical signs, such as the presence of cerebellar atrophy, sensorimotor axonal neuropathy, and elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 22 Italian patients from 21 families, presenting progressive cerebellar ataxia, axonal neuropathy, and elevated serum AFP. We screened the coding regions of ATM, APTX and SETX genes for point mutations by direct sequencing or DHPLC, and searched genomic rearrangements in SETX by MLPA analysis. In selected cases, quantification of ATM and senataxin proteins was performed by Western blot. Clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging data were collected. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (12 families) carried SETX mutations (AOA2, 57%), two were mutated in ATM (A-T), and three in APTX (AOA1). In three remaining patients, we could not find pathogenic mutations, and in one case we found, in homozygosis, the SETX p.K992R polymorphism (population frequency 1-2%). In AOA2 cases, we identified 14 novel and three reported SETX mutations. Signs at onset were gait ataxia and facial dyskinesia, and the age ranged between 11 and 18 years. None had obvious oculomotor apraxia at the latest examination (age 14-45 years). The patient carrying the p.K992R SETX polymorphism had a phenotype similar to that of the diagnosed AOA2 patients, while the other three undiagnosed subjects had a very late onset and a few distinguishing clinical features. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We describe a large series of 13 AOA2 Italian patients. The phenotype was consistent with previous descriptions of AOA2, except for a higher frequency of strabism, and for the absence of oculomotor apraxia. In our survey ~60% of juvenile-to-adult cases with cerebellar ataxia, sensorimotor neuropathy and increased AFP are due to mutations in the SETX gene, and a smaller percentage to APTX and ATM gene mutations.</text></passage></document><document><id>1906</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Saethre   Chotzen syndrome with an atypical phenotype: identification of TWIST microdeletion by array CGH.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Saethre   Chotzen syndrome is a very rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by craniosynostosis and acrocephalosyndactyly.

RBPs therefore have opportunities to shape gene expression at multiple levels. This capacity is particularly important during development, when dynamic chemical and physical changes give rise to complex organs and tissues. This review discusses RBPs in the context of heart development. Since the targets and functions of most RBPs--in the heart and at large--are not fully understood, this review focuses on the expression and roles of RBPs that have been implicated in specific stages of heart development or developmental pathology. RBPs are involved in nearly every stage of cardiogenesis, including the formation, morphogenesis, and maturation of the heart. A fuller understanding of the roles and substrates of these proteins could ultimately provide attractive targets for the design of therapies for congenital heart defects, cardiovascular disease, or cardiac tissue repair.</text></passage></document><document><id>1909</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prenatal diagnosis of fetal peters' plus syndrome: a case report.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>Peters' plus syndrome is a rare but clinically recognizable autosomal recessive ocular genetic syndrome.

Thus, comparing receptor trafficking pathways in normal vs. cancer cells requires the ability to image cells expressing dramatically different receptor expression levels. Here, we have presented a significant technical advance to the analysis and processing of images collected using intensity based F  rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) confocal microscopy. An automated Image J macro was developed to select region of interests (ROI) based on intensity and statistical-based thresholds within cellular images with reduced FRET signal. Furthermore, SSMD (strictly standardized mean differences), a statistical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) evaluation parameter, was used to validate the quality of FRET analysis, in particular of ROI database selection. The Image J ROI selection macro together with SSMD as an evaluation parameter of SNR levels, were used to investigate the endocytic recycling of Tfn-TFR complexes at nanometer range resolution in human normal vs. breast cancer cells expressing significantly different levels of endogenous TFR. Here, the FRET-based assay demonstrates that Tfn-TFR complexes in normal epithelial vs. breast cancer cells show a significantly different E% behavior during their endocytic recycling pathway. Since E% is a relative measure of distance, we propose that these changes in E% levels represent conformational changes in Tfn-TFR complexes during endocytic pathway. Thus, our results indicate that Tfn-TFR complexes undergo different conformational changes in normal vs. cancer cells, indicating that the organization of Tfn-TFR complexes at the nanometer range is significantly altered during the endocytic recycling pathway in cancer cells. In summary, improvements in the automated selection of FRET ROI datasets allowed us to detect significant changes in E% with potential biological significance in human normal vs. cancer cells.</text></passage></document><document><id>1911</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1 gene Molecular Alterations in Omani Breast Cancer Patients.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer reported in females in Oman and usually occurs at a relatively younger age, presents at an advanced stage and behaves aggressively. BC occurs in hereditary and sporadic forms. Although germ-line mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are rare in sporadic cases compared with hereditary cases, molecular alterations, such as loss of heterozygosity, and CpG methylation, are common. In this study, we investigated the types of molecular alterations associated with hereditary and sporadic BRCA1-associated BC in Omani patients. Methods: We obtained clinical data and samples from 43 sporadic BC patients. The selection of cases was made based on the following criteria: aged  &lt;= 40 years, or bilateral breast cancer, or estrogen and progesterone receptor negative status, and HER-2/neu negative (Triple Negative phenotype) status. Screening for molecular alterations was performed by direct sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Results: Genomic deletions and duplication in the BRCA1 gene were identified in four female patients. Two patients carried exon 1 and 2 deletions and two showed exon 1 and 2 duplication. Screening for mutation by direct sequencing revealed three polymorphisms in exon 11. Two of these polymorphisms are nonsynonymous (rs1800704, rs799917) and one is synonymous (rs1800740). Conclusion: The current pilot study detected previously described gene rearrangements and polymorphisms involving the BRCA1 gene and no seemingly pathogenic missense mutations were elucidated.

Rhes is involved in the dopamine receptor-mediated signaling and behavior though adenylyl cyclase. The striatum-specific GTPase share a close homology with Dexras1, which regulates iron trafficking in the neurons when activated though the post-translational modification called s-nitrosylation by nitric oxide (NO). We report that Rhes physiologically interacted with Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein7 and participated in iron uptake via divalent metal transporter 1 similar to Dexras1. Interestingly, Rhes is not S-nitrosylated by NO-treatment, however phosphorylated by protein kinase A at the site of serine-239. Two Rhes mutants - the phosphomimetic form (serine 239 to aspartic acid) and constitutively active form (alanine 173 to valine) - displayed an increase in iron uptake compared to the wild-type Rhes. These findings suggest that Rhes may play a crucial role in striatal iron homeostasis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1913</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Psychosine, the cytotoxic sphingolipid that accumulates in globoid cell leukodystrophy, alters membrane architecture.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) is a neurological disease caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC). In the absence of GALC, the cytotoxic glycosphingolipid, psychosine (psy), accumulates in the nervous system. Psychosine accumulation preferentially affects oligodendrocytes, leading to progressive demyelination and infiltration of activated monocytes/macrophages into the CNS. GLD is characterized by motor defects, cognitive deficits, seizures, and death by 2-5 years of age. It has been hypothesized that psychosine accumulation, primarily within lipid rafts, results in the pathogenic cascade in GLD. However, the mechanism of psychosine toxicity has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we synthesized the enantiomer of psychosine (ent-psy) to use as a probe to distinguish between protein-psy (stereo-specific enantioselective) or membrane-psy (stereo-insensitive nonenantioselective) interactions. The enantiomer of psychosine has equal or greater toxicity compared with psy, suggesting that psy exerts its toxicity through a nonenantioselective mechanism. Finally, in this study we demonstrate that psy and ent-psy localize to lipid rafts, perturb natural and artificial membrane integrity, and inhibit protein Kinase C translocation to the plasma membrane. Although other mechanisms may play a role in disease, these data strongly suggest that psy exerts its effects primarily through membrane perturbation rather than through specific protein-psy interactions.</text></passage></document><document><id>1914</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Report of the first Outcome Measures in Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (OMMYD-1) international workshop: Clearwater, Florida, November 30, 2011.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>140</offset></passage></document><document><id>1915</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Frequent promoter methylation of CDH1 in non-neoplastic mucosa of sporadic diffuse gastric cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>BACKGROUND/AIM: To identify promoter methylation as a major silencing mechanism in potential precursor lesions of sporadic diffuse gastric cancer (DGC), we investigated promoter methylation of CDH1 (E-Cadherin gene) in a series of DGCs and matched normal mucosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extent of CDH1 gene promoter methylation was explored using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and pyrosequencing (PS) in 72 DGCs with a matched pair of normal mucosa. RESULTS: MSP and PS revealed CDH1 promoter methylation in 73.6% (53/72) and 77.8% (56/72) of DGC samples, respectively. PS detected CDH1 methylation in 70.8% (51/72) and 72.2% (52/72) of matched normal mucosa from adjacent and remote foci, respectively. In comparison, CDH1 promoter methylation was detected in 12/24 normal gastric mucosa samples without DGC, and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.016).

Segregation errors lead to chromosomal instability (CIN), with deleterious consequences. Mutations in the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) initiate most colon cancers and have also been suggested to promote disease progression through increased CIN, but the mechanistic role of APC in preventing CIN remains controversial. Using fly embryos as a model, we investigated the role of APC proteins in CIN. Our findings suggest that APC2 loss leads to increased rates of chromosome segregation error. This occurs through a cascade of events beginning with incomplete centrosome separation leading to failure to inhibit formation of ectopic cleavage furrows, which result in mitotic defects and DNA damage. We test several hypotheses related to the mechanism of action of APC2, revealing that APC2 functions at the embryonic cortex with several protein partners, including Axin, to promote mitotic fidelity. Our in vivo data demonstrate that APC2 protects genome stability by modulating mitotic fidelity through regulation of the cytoskeleton.</text></passage></document><document><id>1917</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evaluation of rare variants in the new fanconi anemia gene ERCC4 (FANCQ) as familial breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility alleles.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>Recently, it has been reported that biallelic mutations in the ERCC4 (FANCQ) gene cause Fanconi anemia (FA) subtype FA-Q.

The frequency of ERCC4 mutation carriers does not differ between cases and controls, suggesting that ERCC4 is not a cancer susceptibility gene. Interestingly, the prevalence of ERCC4 mutation carriers (one in 288) is similar to that reported for FANCA, whereas there are approximately 100-fold more FA-A than FA-Q patients, indicating that most biallelic combinations of ERCC4 mutations are embryo lethal.

We report a family including 10 males and 1 female affected with profound non-specific intellectual disability (ID) which was linked to a 30-cM region extending from Xp11.21 (ALAS2) to Xq22.3 (COL4A5). Parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons identified a frameshift mutation (c.5898dupC) of MED12. Mutated mRNA was not affected by non-sense mediated RNA decay and induced an additional abnormal isoform due to activation of cryptic splice-sites in exon 41. Dysmorphic features common to most affected males were long narrow face, high forehead, flat malar area, high nasal bridge, and short philtrum. Language was absent or very limited. Most patients had a friendly personality. Cognitive impairment, varying from borderline to profound ID was similarly observed in seven heterozygous females. There was no correlation between cognitive function and X-chromosome inactivation profiles in blood cells. The severe degree of ID in male patients, as well as variable cognitive impairment in heterozygous females suggests that the duplication observed in the present family may have a more severe effect on MED12 function than missense mutations. In a cognitively impaired male from this family, who also presented with tall stature and dysmorphism and did not have the MED12 mutation, a 600-kb duplication at 17p13.3 including the YWHAE gene, was found in a mosaic state.</text></passage></document><document><id>1919</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>C3 deficiencies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>17</offset></passage></document><document><id>1920</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Colchicine in breast milk of patients with familial Mediterranean fever. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>OBJECTIVE .

METHODS: We investigated 57 patients with early-treated classical PKU aged 19 to 41 years (mean age 31 years) and 46 matched healthy controls, matched for age and socioeconomic status. Patients and controls were assessed for their intelligence quotient (IQ), and attention and information-processing abilities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed in all patients. Neuropsychological assessments and MRI were repeated at a five-year-follow-up. RESULTS: In the five-year interval IQ, information processing and attention of patients and controls remained constant. At both assessment times the IQ scores were significantly lower in patients compared to controls. Older adult patients (>32 years) showed poorer information processing and attention at both assessment times compared to young adult patients (&lt;32 years) and controls. IQ, information processing and attention showed no correlation to imaging results but were significantly correlated to blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in patients' childhood and adolescence, and Phe levels had been higher in the adolescent years of older adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive performance in adult patients with early-treated PKU does not seem to be subject to deterioration observable in a five-year interval. Neuropsychological assessment in adults with PKU revealed neurocognitive impairment particularly in older adult patients. This seems to refer to an early relaxation of diet that was recommended when the older patients were adolescents. Results indicate a benefit of dietary control during adolescence in PKU.</text></passage></document><document><id>1923</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Insulin gene region contributes to genetic susceptibility to, but may not to low incidence of, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Japanese. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>144</offset><text>In the Caucasian population , it has been demonstrated that the insulin gene ( INS ) region contains the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus locus ( IDDM2 ) .

Patients with HCP show &lt;50% of normal activity and those with the rare autosomal recessive harderoporphyria accumulate harderoporphyrinogen, an intermediate porphyrin of the CPOX reaction. To clarify the relationship of the low enzyme activity with these diseases, we expressed mutant CPOX carrying His-tag from these porphyria patients and co-expressed mutant CPOX carrying His-tag and normal CPOX carrying HA-tag in a tandem fashion in Escherichia coli. Purification of the His-tag-containing enzyme revealed that the His-enzyme forms a heterodimer in association with the HA-enzyme, and analysis using a cross-link reagent confirmed that the enzyme is a dimer (   70 kDa). Then, we expressed homo- and heterodimers composed of the wild-type (wt) and engineered mutants of the enzyme or mutants from HCP patients. The monomer form of mutated CPOX did not show any activity and homodimeric enzymes derived from HCP mutant showed low activity (&lt;20% of the control). Some mutations of amino acids 401-404 were associated with marked accumulation of harderoporphyrinogen, with a decrease in the production of protoporphyrinogen, whereas K404E derived from patients with harderoporphyria produced less harderoporphyrinogen. The heterodimers with wt and mutated subunits from HCP patients showed low protoporphyrinogen producing activity. These results show that the substitution of amino acids from R401 to K404 results in extremely low enzyme activity with either mutant homodimer or heterodimers containing normal and mutated subunits and can be linked to HCP disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1927</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Clinical and imaging features and genetic analysis of a case with adult-onset Krabbe disease].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical and imaging features of a patient with adult-onset Krabbe disease and to detect the underlying genetic mutations.

RESULTS: The patient had presented asymmetric limb weakness and difficulty in walking. Electromyography suggested peripheral nerve demyelination. Cranial MRI showed increased signal intensity in white matter with involvement of the corticospinal tracts. Screening of GALC gene mutation has found the patient to be heterozygous for T1685C (Ile562Thr) and homozygous for A1921G (Thr641Ala), both of which were considered to be polymorphisms. In addition, he was heterozygous for G136T (Asp46Tyr), which had not been described previously. CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations of adult-onset Krabbe disease may be atypical. Cranial MRI and galactocerebroside activity assay should be carried out for patients featuring chronic progressive corticospinal tract injury.

Among these patients, three had de novo pure 2pter deletions, one presented with a paternal derivative der(2)t(2;15)(p25.3;q26) with deletion in the 2pter region and the last patient presented with an interstitial 2p25 deletion. The size of the deletions was characterized by SNP array or array-CGH and was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. Four patients shared a 2p25.3 deletion with a minimal critical region estimated at 1.97   Mb and encompassing seven genes, namely SH3HYL1, ACP1, TMEMI8, SNTG2, TPO, PXDN, and MYT1L genes. The fifth patient had a smaller interstitial deletion encompassing the TPO, PXDN, and MYT1L genes. Paternal origin of the deletion was determined by genotyping using microsatellite markers. Analysis of the genes encompassed in the deleted region led us to speculate that the ACP1, TMEM18, and/or MYT1L genes might be involved in early-onset obesity. In addition, intellectual deficiency and behavioural troubles can be explained by the heterozygous loss of the SNTG2 and MYT1L genes. Finally, we discuss the parent-of-origin of the deletion.</text></passage></document><document><id>1930</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Alternatives to risk-reducing surgery for ovarian cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>58</offset><text>BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have an 18%-60% and 11%-27% lifetime risk of developing ovarian carcinoma, respectively.

Gynecological screening programs with periodical trans-vaginal ultrasound and serum CA125 assay have been widely used in women at hereditary high risk of ovarian carcinoma, but clinical results have been conflicting. These surveillance protocols have often fallen short of expectations because of the advanced stage of ovarian carcinoma in the identified screened women. Several investigations have been addressed to the detection of additional tumor markers able to generate more reliable screening tools. The combined serum assay of leptin, prolactin, osteopontin, CA125, macrophage inhibiting factor and insulin-like growth factor-II appears to have a significant better diagnostic reliability compared with serum CA125 alone in discriminating healthy individuals from ovarian carcinoma patients, and therefore, it could have a role in the screening of women at high risk for this malignancy.

BRCA carriers had significantly prolonged median overall survival (93.6 months) compared with noncarriers (66.6 months; 95% confidence interval 44.5-91.7, P = 0.0081). There was no difference in progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a wide variety of BRCA mutations in a highly ethnically diverse EOC population, and confirm that EOC BRCA mutation carriers have better prognosis with longer median survival than patients with nonhereditary disease. The contribution of unclassified BRCA variants to cancer etiology remains undetermined.</text></passage></document><document><id>1933</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cowden syndrome and the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome: how to define rare genetic syndromes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset></passage></document><document><id>1934</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>BRCA1/2 and clinical outcome in a monoinstitutional cohort of women with hereditary breast cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset><text>The clinical outcome of BRCA mutation carriers and non-carriers still remains a topic of discussion. In order to interpret controversial data, in the present study, we analyzed a large consecutive monoinstitutional series of breast cancer patients and relatives with familial features carrying or not carrying BRCA mutations. The intense research in recent years regarding the clinical genetics of patients with breast or ovarian cancer and their relatives has allowed the organization of a unique database comprising anamnestic, clinical, pathological and molecular data. Families with two or more cases of breast cancer under the age of 50 years, or with three cases at any age, were identified. From June, 2003 to June, 2010, a total of 202 patients (136 probands + 66 relatives) from 45 families were included in the analysis. A total of 136 (49 carrier and 87 non-carrier) cases had a cancer diagnosis at the time of their genetic testing. Twenty and 24 events were observed in the carrier and control group, respectively. The 10-year disease-free suvival rate was 57% for patients in the control group compared with 50% for patients carrying a BRCA mutation (P=0.15 by log-rank test). Finally, 66 (32 genetic and 34 control) cases were unaffected at the time of molecular analysis, and 6 new cases of cancer were observed in the carriers, while no new cases were detected in the control cohort. Thus, at age 50, 40% of carriers had a high risk of disease (P=0.0069 by log-rank test). Our data support the hypothesis that the presence of BRCA mutations does not alter the clinical outcome for hereditary breast cancer patients. Conversely, BRCA mutations are proven to be crucial for prediction of risk in healthy relatives from carrier families.</text></passage></document><document><id>1935</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Dual targeting of peroxisomal proteins.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>40</offset><text>Cellular compartmentalization into organelles serves to separate biological processes within the environment of a single cell. While some metabolic reactions are specific to a single organelle, others occur in more than one cellular compartment. Specific targeting of proteins to compartments inside of eukaryotic cells is mediated by defined sequence motifs. To achieve multiple targeting to different compartments cells use a variety of strategies. Here, we focus on mechanisms leading to dual targeting of peroxisomal proteins. In many instances, isoforms of peroxisomal proteins with distinct intracellular localization are encoded by separate genes. But also single genes can give rise to differentially localized proteins. Different isoforms can be generated by use of alternative transcriptional start sites, by differential splicing or ribosomal read-through of stop codons. In all these cases different peptide variants are produced, of which only one carries a peroxisomal targeting signal. Alternatively, peroxisomal proteins contain additional signals that compete for intracellular targeting. Dual localization of proteins residing in both the cytoplasm and in peroxisomes may also result from use of inefficient targeting signals. The recent observation that some bona fide cytoplasmic enzymes were also found in peroxisomes indicates that dual targeting of proteins to both the cytoplasm and the peroxisome might be more widespread. Although current knowledge of proteins exhibiting only partial peroxisomal targeting is far from being complete, we speculate that the metabolic capacity of peroxisomes might be larger than previously assumed.</text></passage></document><document><id>1936</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Deletion of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) in Prader-Willi syndrome detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization: two sibs with the typical phenotype without a cytogenetic deletion in chromosome 15q. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>225</offset><text>The small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N ( SNRPN ) gene is regarded as one of the candidates for Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) .

Here, we show how partner recognition of the AXH domain of the transcriptional co-regulator ataxin-1 is fine-tuned by a subtle balance between self- and hetero-associations. Ataxin-1 is the protein responsible for the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, a disease linked to protein aggregation and transcriptional dysregulation. Expansion of a polyglutamine tract is essential for ataxin-1 aggregation, but the sequence-wise distant AXH domain plays an important aggravating role in the process. The AXH domain is also a key element for non-aberrant function as it intervenes in interactions with multiple protein partners. Previous data have shown that AXH is dimeric in solution and forms a dimer of dimers when crystallized. By solving the structure of a complex of AXH with a peptide from the interacting transcriptional repressor CIC, we show that the dimer interface of AXH is displaced by the new interaction and that, when blocked by the CIC peptide AXH aggregation and misfolding are impaired. This is a unique example in which palindromic self- and hetero-interactions within a sequence with chameleon properties discriminate the partner. We propose a drug design strategy for the treatment of SCA1 that is based on the information gained from the AXH/CIC complex.</text></passage></document><document><id>1939</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Anti-factor H autoantibodies assay.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>36</offset><text>Non-Shiga-toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (atypical HUS) is a rare form of thrombotic microangiopathy which associates hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. In 10 % of cases the disease is linked to presence of autoantibodies directed against Factor H (FH), the main plasmatic alternative complement pathway regulatory protein. Their presence induces an acquired functional FH deficiency. The anti-FH autoantibodies screening must be performed at the very onset of the disease in all cases of HUS, in order, first, to make the proper diagnosis as early as possible, and second to support an appropriate therapy including early plasma exchanges and immunosuppressive treatments. Thus, anti-CFH IgG represents a diagnostic marker and the titer determination is useful for assessing disease evolution, because changes precede clinical symptoms, and for monitoring of treatment. Presence of anti-FH IgG has been recently reported to be associated with other clinical context such as C3 glomerulopathies, but their pathogenicity in these conditions remains to be assessed. Here we describe the ELISA assay allowing the detection of these autoantibodies and report the analysis which can be performed concomitantly to improve the diagnosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1940</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Advances in clinical and molecular genetics studies on argininemia].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>Argininemia is a rare, autosomal recessive, metabolic disorder caused by an hereditary deficiency of hepatocytes arginase due to ARG1 gene defect. Arginase is the final enzyme in the urea cycle, catalyzing the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea. Research advances in the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prenatal diagnosis and genetics of argininemia were reviewed in this paper. The clinical manifestations of patients with argininemia are complicated and nonspecific so that clinical diagnosis is usually difficult and delayed. Progressive spastic tetraplegia, seizures and cerebella atrophy are common clinical features of the disease. Blood amino acids analysis, arginase assay and ARG1 gene analysis are important to the diagnosis of argininemia. Early diagnosis and a protein-restricted diet with citrulline and benzoate supplements can contribute a lot to improve patient prognosis. With the application of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in selective screening and newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism, an ever-increasing number of patients with argininemia are detected at the asymptomatic or early stages.</text></passage></document><document><id>1941</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>High resolution SNP array profiling identifies variability in retinoblastoma genome stability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>95</offset><text>Both hereditary and nonhereditary retinoblastoma (Rb) are commonly initiated by loss of both copies of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1), while additional genomic changes are required for tumor initiation and progression. Our aim was to determine whether there is genomic heterogeneity between different clinical Rb subtypes. Therefore, 21 Rb tumors from 11 hereditary patients and 10 nonhereditary Rb patients were analyzed using high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and gene losses and gains were validated with Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification. In these tumors only a few focal aberrations were detected. The most frequent was a focal gain on chromosome 2p24.3, the minimal region of gain encompassing the oncogene MYCN. The genes BAZ1A, OTX2, FUT8, and AKT1 were detected in four focal regions on chromosome 14 in one nonhereditary Rb. There was a large difference in number of copy number aberrations between tumors. A subset of nonhereditary Rbs turned out to be the most genomic unstable, while especially very young patients with hereditary Rb display stable genomes. Established Rb copy number aberrations, including gain of chromosome arm 1q and loss of chromosome arm 16q, turned out to be preferentially associated with the nonhereditary Rbs with later age of diagnosis. In contrast, copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity was detected mainly on chromosome 13, where RB1 resides, irrespective of hereditary status or age. Focal amplifications and deletions and copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity besides chromosome 13 appear to be rare events in retinoblastoma.</text></passage></document><document><id>1942</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of WASP mutations, mutation hotspots and genotype-phenotype disparities in 24 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>137</offset><text>The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , an X-linked immunodeficiency disease caused by mutation in the recently isolated gene encoding WAS protein ( WASP ) , is known to be associated with extensive clinical heterogeneity .

To address this issue we characterized WASP mutations in 24 unrelated WAS patients , including 18 boys with severe classical WAS and 6 boys expressing mild forms of the disease , and then examined the degree of correlation of these as well as all previously published WASP mutations with disease severity .

Consequently, offspring may inherit a new mutation and develop the disease later in life. Over the last 5   years there has been a renewed interest in IAs. This article provides an overview of the latest research on IAs, including their clinical implications, frequency, haplotype, and likelihood of CAG repeat expansion, as well as patient understanding and current genetic counselling practices.

We studied the clinical and radiological features in 81 patients from the literature and 5 own patients trying to identify distinct subgroups . In addition , we tested genetic linkage to the SJS locus on chromosome 1 in one family with two affected sibs .

Accordingly, protein interactions and the structural knowledge on interacting surfaces of proteins (interfaces) have an important role in predicting the genotype-phenotype relationship. We have built the phenotype specific sub-networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving the relevant genes responsible for lung and brain metastasis from primary tumor in breast cancer. First, we selected the PPIs most relevant to metastasis causing genes (seed genes), by using the "guilt-by-association" principle. Then, we modeled structures of the interactions whose complex forms are not available in Protein Databank (PDB). Finally, we mapped mutations to interface structures (real and modeled), in order to spot the interactions that might be manipulated by these mutations. Functional analyses performed on these sub-networks revealed the potential relationship between immune system-infectious diseases and lung metastasis progression, but this connection was not observed significantly in the brain metastasis. Besides, structural analyses showed that some PPI interfaces in both metastasis sub-networks are originating from microbial proteins, which in turn were mostly related with cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is a key mechanism in metastasis, therefore these PPIs may be involved in similar molecular pathways that are shared by infectious disease and metastasis. Finally, by mapping the mutations and amino acid variations on the interface regions of the proteins in the metastasis sub-networks we found evidence for some mutations to be involved in the mechanisms differentiating the type of the metastasis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1948</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Compound loss of muscleblind-like function in myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a multi-systemic disease that impacts cardiac and skeletal muscle as well as the central nervous system (CNS). DM is unusual because it is an RNA-mediated disorder due to the expression of toxic microsatellite expansion RNAs that alter the activities of RNA processing factors, including the muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins. While these mutant RNAs inhibit MBNL1 splicing activity in heart and skeletal muscles, Mbnl1 knockout mice fail to recapitulate the full-range of DM symptoms in these tissues. Here, we generate mouse Mbnl compound knockouts to test the hypothesis that Mbnl2 functionally compensates for Mbnl1 loss. Although Mbnl1(-/-) ; Mbnl2(-/-) double knockouts (DKOs) are embryonic lethal, Mbnl1(-/-) ; Mbnl2(+/-) mice are viable but develop cardinal features of DM muscle disease including reduced lifespan, heart conduction block, severe myotonia and progressive skeletal muscle weakness. Mbnl2 protein levels are elevated in Mbnl1(-/-) knockouts where Mbnl2 targets Mbnl1-regulated exons. These findings support the hypothesis that compound loss of MBNL function is a critical event in DM pathogenesis and provide novel mouse models to investigate additional pathways disrupted in this RNA-mediated disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>1949</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic mapping in papillon-lef  vre syndrome: a report of two cases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>70</offset><text>Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) is a rare autosomal recessive heterogeneous trait which is characterized by erythematous palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, early-onset periodontitis, and associated calcification of dura mater.

Only a few RCM-causing mutations have been described. Most mutations causing RCM are located in sarcomere protein genes which also cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Other genes associated with RCM include the desmin and familial amyloidosis genes. In the present study we describe familial RCM with severe heart failure triggered by a de novo mutation in TTN, encoding the huge muscle filament protein titin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Family members underwent physical examination, ECG and Doppler echocardiogram studies. The family comprised 6 affected individuals aged 12-35 years. Linkage to candidate loci was performed, followed by gene sequencing. Candidate loci/gene analysis excluded 18 candidate genes but showed segregation with a common haplotype surrounding the TTN locus. Sequence analysis identified a de novo mutation within exon 266 of the TTN gene, resulting in the replacement of tyrosine by cysteine. p.Y7621C affects a highly conserved region in the protein within a fibronectin-3 domain, belonging to the A/I junction region of titin. No other disease-causing mutation was identified in cardiomyopathy genes by whole exome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows, for the first time, that mutations in TTN can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy. The giant filament titin is considered to be a determinant of a resting tension of the sarcomere and this report provides genetic evidence of its crucial role in diastolic function.</text></passage></document><document><id>1953</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a novel synonymous mutation in the human b -Ureidopropionase Gene UPB1 affecting pre-mRNA splicing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>b-Ureidopropionase is the third enzyme of the pyrimidine degradation pathway and it catalyzes the conversion of N-carbamyl-b-alanine and N-carbamyl-b-aminoisobutyric acid to b-alanine and b-aminoisobutyric acid, respectively, and ammonia and CO2.

Here, we report the clinical, biochemical, and molecular analysis of a newly identified patient with b-ureidopropionase deficiency. Mutation analysis of the UPB1 gene showed that the patient was compound heterozygous for a novel synonymous mutation c.93C >T (p.Gly31Gly) in exon 1 and a previously described missense mutation c.977G >A (p.Arg326Gln) in exon 9. The in silico predicted effect of the synonymous mutation p.Gly31Gly on pre-mRNA splicing was investigated using a minigene approach. Wild-type and the mutated minigene constructs, containing the entire exon 1, intron 1, and exon 2 of UPB1, yielded different splicing products after expression in HEK293 cells. The c.93C >T (p.Gly31Gly) mutation resulted in altered pre-mRNA splicing of the UPB1 minigene construct and a deletion of the last 13 nucleotides of exon 1. This deletion (r.92_104delGCAAGGAACTCAG) results in a frame shift and the generation of a premature stop codon (p.Lys32SerfsX31). Using a minigene approach, we have thus identified the first synonymous mutation in the UPB1 gene, creating a cryptic splice-donor site affecting pre-mRNA splicing.</text></passage></document><document><id>1954</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A role for the human peroxisomal half-transporter ABCD3 in the oxidation of dicarboxylic acids.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>96</offset><text>Peroxisomes play a major role in human cellular lipid metabolism, including fatty acid b-oxidation. Free fatty acids (FFAs) can enter peroxisomes through passive diffusion or by means of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including HsABCD1 (ALDP, adrenoleukodystrophy protein), HsABCD2 (ALDRP) and HsABCD3 (PMP70). The physiological functions of the different peroxisomal half-ABCD transporters have not been fully determined yet, but there are clear indications that both HsABCD1 and HsABCD2 are required for the breakdown of fatty acids in peroxisomes. Here we report that the phenotype of the pxa1/pxa2/\ yeast mutant, i.e. impaired oxidation of oleic acid, cannot only be partially rescued by HsABCD1, HsABCD2, but also by HsABCD3, which indicates that each peroxisomal half-transporter can function as homodimer. Fatty acid oxidation measurements using various fatty acids revealed that although the substrate specificities of HsABCD1, HsABCD2 and HsABCD3 are overlapping, they have distinctive preferences. Indeed, most hydrophobic C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids are preferentially transported by HsABCD1, C22:0 and C22:6 by HsABCD2 and most hydrophilic substrates like long-chain unsaturated-, long branched-chain- and long-chain dicarboxylic fatty acids by HsABCD3. All these fatty acids are most likely transported as CoA esters. We postulate a role for human ABCD3 in the oxidation of dicarboxylic acids and a role in buffering fatty acids that are overflowing from the mitochondrial b-oxidation system.</text></passage></document><document><id>1955</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Lysosome-associated protein 1 (LAMP-1) and lysosome-associated protein 2 (LAMP-2) in a larger family carrier of Fabry disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>This study investigated the potential relationship between the expression levels of lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP) 1 and 2 and responses to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in the members of a single family with Fabry disease (FD).

Previous reports have indicated that in Chinese girls, the detection rate of WT1 mutations is 16.7% for early onset isolated nephrotic syndrome. The detection rate of WT1 mutations in Chinese girls with sporadic isolated SRNS is unknown. We examined WT1 mutations in 14 Chinese girls with sporadic isolated SRNS using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing and studied a control group of 38 boys with sporadic isolated SRNS. We identified a WT1 mutation in 1 of 14 (7.1% detection rate) Chinese girls with sporadic isolated SRNS. No mutations occurred in WT1 in the remaining 13 girls or the control group. Our investigation supports the necessity of genetic examination for mutations in WT1 in girls with sporadic isolated SRNS.</text></passage></document><document><id>1958</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular and clinical investigation of Iranian patients with Friedreich ataxia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) triplet expansions in the FXN gene. Its product, frataxin, which severely reduces in FRDA patients, leads to oxidative damage in mitochondria. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the triple nucleotide repeated expansions in Iranian FRDA patients and to elucidate distinguishable FRDA clinical differences in these patients. METHODS: A number of 22 Iranian patients (8 females and 14 males) from 16 unrelated families were studied. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of patients. The frequency and length of (GAA)n repeats in intron 1 of the FXN gene were analyzed using long-range PCR. In this study, the clinical criteria of FRDA in our patients and the variability in their clinical signs were also demonstrated. RESULTS: An inverse relationship was observed between GAA repeat size and the age of onset. Although some distinguishable clinical features (such as limb ataxia and lower limb areflexia) were found in our patients, 90-95% of them had extensor plantar response and dysarthria. The results showed only one positive diabetes patient and also different effects on eye movement abnormality among our patients. CONCLUSION: The onset age of symptoms showed a significant inverse correlation with allele size in our patients (P>0.05). Based on comparisons of the clinical data of all patients, clinical presentation of FRDA in Iranian patients did not differ significantly from other FRDA patients previously reported.</text></passage></document><document><id>1959</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Giant axon formation in mice lacking Kell, XK, or Kell and XK: animal models of McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>117</offset><text>McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome (MLS) is a rare X-linked multisystem disease caused by XK gene mutations and characterized by hematological and neurological abnormalities. XK, a putative membrane transporter, is expressed ubiquitously and is covalently linked to Kell, an endothelin-3-converting enzyme (ECE-3). Absence of XK results in reduction of Kell at sites where both proteins are coexpressed. To elucidate the functional roles of XK, Kell, and the XK-Kell complex associated with pathogenesis in MLS, we studied the pathology of the spinal cord, anterior roots, sciatic nerve, and skeletal muscle from knockout mouse models, using Kel(-/-), Xk(-/-), Kel(-/-)Xk(-/-), and wild-type mice aged 6 to 18 months. A striking finding was that giant axons were frequently associated with paranodal demyelination. The pathology suggests probable anterograde progression from the spinal cord to the sciatic nerve. The neuropathological abnormalities were found in all three genotypes, but were more marked in the double-knockout Kel(-/-)Xk(-/-) mice than in either Kel(-/-) or Xk(-/-) mice. Skeletal muscles from Xk(-/-) and Kel(-/-)Xk(-/-) mice showed mild abnormalities, but those from Kel(-/-) mice were similar to the wild type. The more marked neuropathological abnormalities in Kel(-/-)Xk(-/-) mice suggest a  possible functional association between XK and Kell in nonerythroid tissues.</text></passage></document><document><id>1960</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Neonatal jaundice and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in Basrah.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>78</offset><text>In a study on a group of 186 newborn babies presenting with jaundice, erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was detected in 95 (51%) of the patients.

Histologically, the tumor is composed of blue round cells with frequent expression of CD56 in addition to myogenic markers. Recent studies of ARMS have shown two specific recurrent translocations: PAX3-FKHR [t(2;13)(q35;q14)] or PAX7-FKHR [t(1;13)(p36;q14)]. Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) occurs most frequently in the upper aerodigestive tract with a male preference in East Asia and Central and South Americas with neoplastic cells frequently expressing CD56. We report a 53-year-old Taiwanese man presenting with a nasopharyngeal mass, cervical lymphadenopathy, and multiple bone metastases. Histologically, the nasopharyngeal biopsy revealed diffuse sheets of small blue round tumor cells without obvious alveolar pattern, angioinvasion or tumor necrosis. An initial erroneous diagnosis of ENKTL was made due to CD56 expression using fresh tumor tissue with flow cytometric analysis and the patient was treated accordingly. Retrospective study showed that the tumor cells expressed CD56, desmin, and myogenin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the tumor cells were positive for FKHR gene rearrangement, confirming the diagnosis of ARMS. Our case illustrates that a diagnosis of ENKTL based solely on CD56 expression can be misleading for a nasopharyngeal small blue round cell tumor. ARMS should be included as a differential diagnosis, and a correct diagnosis can be reached only after a high index of suspicion and a thorough histological examination with the aid of ancillary studies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1962</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Somatic CTNNB1 mutation in hepatoblastoma from a patient with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome and germline GPC3 mutation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>121</offset><text>Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome is a rare overgrowth syndrome caused by the GPC3 mutation at Xq26 and is clinically characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities, intellectual disability, pre/postnatal overgrowth, distinctive craniofacial features, macrocephaly, and organomegaly. Although this syndrome is known to be associated with a risk for embryonal tumors, similar to other overgrowth syndromes, the pathogenetic basis of this mode of tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we report a boy with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome who had a germline loss-of function mutation in GPC3. At 9 months of age, he developed hepatoblastoma. A comparison of exome analysis results for the germline genome and for the tumor genome revealed a somatic mutation, p.Ile35Ser, within the degradation targeting box of b-catenin. The same somatic mutation in CTNNB1 has been repeatedly reported in hepatoblastoma and other cancers. This finding suggested that the CTNNB1 mutation in the tumor tissue represents a driver mutation and that both the GPC3 and the CTNNB1 mutations contributed to tumorigenesis in a clearly defined sequential manner in the propositus. The current observation of a somatic CTNNB1 mutation in a hepatoblastoma from a patient with a germline GPC3 mutation supports the notion that the mutation in GPC3 may influence one of the initial steps in tumorigenesis and the progression to hepatoblastoma.</text></passage></document><document><id>1963</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The interaction of the atm genotype with inflammation and oxidative stress.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>In ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) the death of neurons is associated with the loss of neuronal cell cycle control. In most Atm(-/-) mouse models, however, these cell cycle anomalies are present but the phenotype of neuronal cell loss found in humans is not. Mouse Atm(-/-) neurons re-enter a cell cycle and replicate their DNA, but they do not die--even months after initiating the cycle. In the current study, we explore whether systemic inflammation or hypoxia-induced oxidative stress can serve as second stressors that can promote cell death in ATM-deficient neurons. We find that after either immune or hypoxic challenge, the levels of cell cycle proteins--PCNA, cyclin A and cyclin B--are significantly elevated in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Both the number of cells that express cell cycle proteins as well as the intensity of the expression levels in each cell is increased in the stressed animals. The cell cycle-positive neurons also increasingly express cell death markers such as activated caspase-3, y-H2AX and TUNEL staining. Interestingly, nuclear HDAC4 localization is also enhanced in Atm(-/-) Purkinje neurons after the immune challenge suggesting that both genetic and epigenetic changes in Atm(-/-) mice respond to environmental challenges. Our findings support the hypothesis that multiple insults are needed to drive even genetically vulnerable neurons to die a cell cycle-related cell death and point to either inflammation or oxidative stressors as potential contributors to the A-T disease process.</text></passage></document><document><id>1964</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The imprinted NPAP1 gene in the Prader-Willi syndrome region belongs to a POM121-related family of retrogenes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>111</offset><text>We have recently shown that the human Nuclear pore-associated protein (NPAP1)/C15orf2 gene encodes a nuclear pore-associated protein. This gene is one of several paternally expressed imprinted genes in the genomic region 15q11q13. Because the Prader-Willi syndrome is known to be caused by the loss of function of paternally expressed genes in 15q11q13, a phenotypic contribution of NPAP1 cannot be excluded. NPAP1 appears to be under strong positive Darwinian selection in primates, suggesting an important function in primate biology. Interestingly, however, in contrast to all other protein-coding genes in 15q11q13, NPAP1 has no ortholog in the mouse. Our investigation of the evolutionary origin of NPAP1 showed that the gene is specific to primate species and absent from the 15q11q13-orthologous regions in all nonprimate mammals. However, we identified a group of paralogous genes, which we call NPAP1L, in all placental mammals except rodents. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NPAP1, NPAP1L, and another group of genes (UPF0607), which is also restricted to primates, are closely related to the vertebrate transmembrane nucleoporin gene POM121, although they lack the transmembrane domain. These three newly identified groups of genes all lack conserved introns, and hence, are likely retrogenes. We hypothesize that, in the common ancestor of placentals, the POM121 gene retrotransposed and gave rise to an NPAP1-ancestral retrogene NPAP1L/NPAP1/UPF0607. Our results suggest that the nuclear pore-associated gene NPAP1 originates from the vertebrate nucleoporin gene POM121 and--after several steps of retrotransposition and duplication-has been subjected to genomic imprinting and positive selection after integration into the imprinted SNRPN-UBE3A chromosomal domain.</text></passage></document><document><id>1965</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of novel point mutations in splicing sites integrating whole-exome and RNA-seq data in myeloproliferative diseases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>131</offset><text>Point mutations in intronic regions near mRNA splice junctions can affect the splicing process.

By SpliceFinder, we identified somatic mutations affecting RNA splicing in a colon cancer sample, in eight atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), and eight CML patients. A novel homozygous splicing mutation was found in APC (NM_000038.4:c.1312+5G>A) and six heterozygous in GNAQ (NM_002072.2:c.735+1C>T), ABCC 3 (NM_003786.3:c.1783-1G>A), KLHDC 1 (NM_172193.1:c.568-2A>G), HOOK 1 (NM_015888.4:c.1662-1G>A), SMAD 9 (NM_001127217.2:c.1004-1C>T), and DNAH 9 (NM_001372.3:c.10242+5G>A). Integrating whole-exome and RNA sequencing in aCML and CML, we assessed the phenotypic effect of mutations on mRNA splicing for GNAQ, ABCC 3, HOOK 1. In ABCC 3 and HOOK 1, RNA-Seq showed the presence of aberrant transcripts with activation of a cryptic splice site or intron retention, validated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the case of HOOK 1. In GNAQ, RNA-Seq showed 22% of wild-type transcript and 78% of mRNA skipping exon 5, resulting in a 4-6 frameshift fusion confirmed by RT-PCR. The pipeline can be useful to identify intronic variants affecting RNA sequence by complementing conventional exome analysis.</text></passage></document><document><id>1966</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Development and Validation of a Fast and Homogeneous Cell-Based Fluorescence Screening Assay for Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1/SLC11A2) Using the FLIPR Tetra.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>164</offset><text>Divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1) is a proton-coupled Fe(2+) transporter that is essential for iron uptake in enterocytes and for transferrin-associated endosomal iron transport in many other cell types. DMT1 dysfunction is associated with several diseases such as iron overload disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The main objective of the present work is to develop and validate a fluorescence-based screening assay for DMT1 modulators. We found that Fe(2+) or Cd(2+) influx could be reliably monitored in calcium 5-loaded DMT1-expressing HEK293 cells using the FLIPR Tetra fluorescence microplate reader. DMT1-mediated metal transport shows saturation kinetics depending on the extracellular substrate concentration, with a K0.5 value of 1.4   M and 3.5   M for Fe(2+) and Cd(2+), respectively. In addition, Cd(2+) was used as a substrate for DMT1, and we find a Ki value of 2.1   M for a compound (2-(3-carbamimidoylsulfanylmethyl-benzyl)-isothiourea) belonging to the benzylisothioureas family, which has been identified as a DMT1 inhibitor. The optimized screening method using this compound as a reference demonstrated a Z' factor of 0.51. In summary, we developed and validated a sensitive and reproducible cell-based fluorescence assay suitable for the identification of compounds that specifically modulate DMT1 transport activity.</text></passage></document><document><id>1967</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>miR-205 down-regulation promotes proliferation of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tumor cells by regulating LRP-1 and ERK phosphorylation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>139</offset><text>Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an intermediate malignancy of the skin.

In this study, we investigated the role of microRNAs in the tumor. microRNA PCR array showed several microRNAs increased or decreased in DFSP in vivo compared with dermatofibroma (DF) and normal skin. Among them, the expression of miR-205 was down-regulated in DFSP compared with DF and normal skin. In situ hybridization showed that miR-205 expression was evident in dermal fibroblasts of normal skin although hardly detected in tumor cells of DF or DFSP. miR-205 inhibitor increased cell proliferation and the luciferase activity of 3'UTR of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) in cultured normal dermal fibroblasts. Immunohistochemistry showed the expression of LRP-1 was increased in DFSP tissue. Knockdown of LRP-1 suppressed cell growth and down-regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation without affecting MEK phosphorylation in cultured DFSP cells. Taken together, LRP-1 overexpression caused by the miR-205 down-regulation may play a role in the abnormal proliferation of DFSP cells via directly regulating ERK phosphorylation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1968</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Revisiting p53 for cancer-specific chemo- and radiotherapy: ten years after.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>Despite intense studies, highly effective therapeutic strategies against cancer have not yet been fully exploited, because few true cancer-specific targets have been identified. Most modalities, perhaps with the exception of radiation therapy, target proliferating cells, which are also abundant in normal tissues. Thus, most current cancer treatments have significant side effects. More than 10 years ago, the tumor suppressor p53 was first explored as a cancer-specific target. At the time, the approach was to introduce a normal p53 gene into mutant p53 (mp53) tumor cells to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, this strategy did not hold up and mostly failed in subsequent clinical studies. Recent research developments have now returned p53 to the limelight. Several studies have reported that mutant or null p53 tumor cells undergo apoptosis more easily than genetically matched, normal p53 counterparts when inhibiting a specific stress kinase in combination with standard chemotherapy or when exposed to an ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor and radiation, thus achieving true cancer specificity in animal tumor models. This short review highlights several of these recent studies, discusses possible mechanism(s) for mp53-mediated "synthetic lethality," and the implications for cancer therapy.</text></passage></document><document><id>1969</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Exonal deletion of SLC24A4 causes hypomaturation amelogenesis imperfecta.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>Amelogenesis imperfecta is a heterogeneous group of genetic conditions affecting enamel formation.

Sequencing of the candidate genes identified a 10-kb deletion, including exons 15, 16, and most of the last exon of the SLC24A4 gene. Interestingly, this deletion was caused by homologous recombination between two 354-bp-long homologous sequences located in intron 14 and the 3' UTR.

The study included 22 probands with at least one of the potential CRB1-associated phenotypes for retinal dystrophy. Variants were detected using Sanger sequencing. The complete sequences of the coding and adjacent intronic regions of CRB1 were analyzed, revealing homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in CRB1 in seven of 22 probands, involving six novel (c.136delA, c.1841G>T, c.3017C>A, c.3488G>T, c.3991C>T and c.4089dupTGTTGCTT) and four known (c.2222T>C, c.2671T>G, c.3676G>T and c.4005+2T>G) mutations.

In particular, ELISA proved to be a technically simple method and its sensitivity was enhanced by using avidin-biotin complex. In this study, DAF levels in extracts of erythrocytes from 30 healthy donors and in extracts of PMN and platelets from 15 healthy donors were measured by ELISA. The DAF content of blood cells from eight patients with PNH and erythrocytes from 13 patients with anaemia were also measured. The DAF levels of normal erythrocytes, PMN and platelets were 3110 +/- 960, 28,000 +/- 13,900 and 3100 +/- 1370 (mean +/- SD) molecules/cell, respectively. In general, the DAF content of PNH cells was below the normal range, although it was within the normal range in some cases of PNH. The DAF levels of PNH-I and -II erythrocytes were estimated from the ratio of PNH-I, -II and -III erythrocytes. And, in four cases of PNH, the DAF levels of PNH-I erythrocytes separated by acidified serum lysis were measured by ELISA.

High percentage GalT gene-trapped chimera obtained were used to generate heterozygous and subsequently, homozygous GalT gene-trapped mice. Biochemical assays confirmed total absence of galactose-1 phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) activity in the homozygotes. Although the homozygous GalT gene-trapped females could conceive and give birth when fed with normal chow, they had smaller litter size (P=0.02) and longer time-to-pregnancy (P=0.013) than their wild-type littermates. Follicle-stimulating hormone levels of the mutant female mice were not significantly different from the age-matched, wild-type females, but histological examination of the ovaries revealed fewer follicles in the homozygous mutants (P=0.007). Administration of a high-galactose (40% w/w) diet to lactating homozygous GalT gene-trapped females led to lethality in over 70% of the homozygous GalT gene-trapped pups before weaning. Cerebral edema, abnormal changes in the Purkinje and the outer granular cell layers of the cerebellum, as well as lower blood GSH/GSSG ratio were identified in the galactose-intoxicated pups. Finally, reduced growth was observed in GalT gene-trapped pups fed with normal chow and all pups fed with high-galactose (20% w/w) diet.

This case-control study was implemented in the NICU and Newborn Ward of Amirkola Children Hospital in 2007-2008. Available sampling approach was used and 50 icteric as well as 50 non-icteric newborns, both with G6PD deficiency, were selected as the case and the control group respectively. G6PD deficiency was diagnosed using FST (Fluorescent Spot Test) method. All samples were first evaluated in terms of Mediterranean mutation and the negative cases were then examined for Chatham mutation; all remaining samples were finally tested for Cosenza mutation. G6PD mutations were compared in the two groups and P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. In icteric group, 76% were male and 24% were female and in non-icteric group, 70% were male and 30% were female.

It acts as a transcriptional activator and repressor. Loss-of-function of Pax6 results in down- and upregulation of a comparable number of genes, although many are secondary targets. Recently, we found a prototype of a Pax6-binding site that acts as a transcriptional repressor. We also identified the Trpm3 gene as a Pax6-direct target containing the miR-204 gene located in intron 6. Thus, there are multiple Pax6-dependent mechanisms of transcriptional repression in the cell. More than 50 Pax6 missense mutations have been identified in humans and mice. Two of these mutations, N50K (Leca4) and R128C (Leca2), were analyzed in depth resulting in different numbers of regulated genes and different ratios of down- and upregulated targets. Thus, additional studies of these mutants are warranted to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the mutants' action. METHODS: Mutations in PAX6 and PAX6(5a), including G18W, R26G, N50K, G64V, R128C, and R242T, were generated with site-directed mutagenesis. A panel of ten luciferase reporters driven by six copies of Pax6-binding sites representing a spectrum of sites that act as repressors, moderate activators, and strong activators were used. Two additional reporters, including the Pax6-regulated enhancer from mouse Trpm3 and six copies of its individual Pax6-binding site, were also tested in P19 cells. RESULTS: PAX6 (N50K) acted either as a loss-of-function or neutral mutation. In contrast, PAX6 (R128C) and (R242T) acted as loss-, neutral, and gain-of-function mutations. With three distinct reporters, the PAX6 (N50K) mutation broke the pattern of effects produced by substitutions in the surrounding helices of the N-terminal region of the paired domain. All six mutations tested acted as loss-of-function using the Trpm3 Pax6-binding site. CONCLUSIONS: These studies highlight the complexity of Pax6-dependent transcriptional activation and repression mechanisms, and identify the N50K and R128C substitutions as valuable tools for testing interactions between Pax6, Pax6 (N50K), and Pax6 (R128C) with other regulatory proteins, including chromatin remodelers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1976</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical features and an atypical WT1 mutant site in a child with incomplete Denys-Drash syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>99</offset></passage></document><document><id>1977</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Coronary heart disease risks associated with high levels of HDL cholesterol.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>77</offset><text>BACKGROUND: The association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and coronary heart disease (CHD) events is not well described in individuals with very high levels of HDL-C (>80 mg/dL). METHODS AND RESULTS: Using pooled data from 6 community-based cohorts we examined CHD and total mortality risks across a broad range of HDL-C, including values in excess of 80 mg/dL. We used Cox proportional hazards models with penalized splines to assess multivariable, adjusted, sex-stratified associations of HDL-C with the hazard for CHD events and total mortality, using HDL-C 45 mg/dL and 55 mg/dL as the referent in men and women, respectively. Analyses included 11 515 men and 12 925 women yielding 307 245 person-years of follow-up. In men, the association between HDL-C and CHD events was inverse and linear across most HDL-C values; however at HDL-C values >90 mg/dL there was a plateau effect in the pattern of association. In women, the association between HDL-C and CHD events was inverse and linear across lower values of HDL-C, however at HDL-C values >75 mg/dL there were no further reductions in the hazard ratio point estimates for CHD. In unadjusted models there were increased total mortality risks in men with very high HDL-C, however mortality risks observed in participants with very high HDL-C were attenuated after adjustment for traditional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe further reductions in CHD risk with HDL-C values higher than 90 mg/dL in men and 75 mg/dL in women.</text></passage></document><document><id>1978</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mandibuloacral Dysplasia Caused by LMNA Mutations and Uniparental Disomy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, craniofacial anomalies, skeletal malformations, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation. Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is characterized by the clinical features of accelerated aging in childhood. Both MAD and HGPS can be caused by mutations in the LMNA gene. In this study, we describe a 2-year-old boy with overlapping features of MAD and HGPS. Mutation analysis of the LMNA gene revealed a homozygous missense change, p.M540T, while only the mother carries the mutation. Uniparental disomy (UPD) analysis for chromosome 1 showed the presence of maternal UPD. Markers in the 1q21.3-q22 region flanking the LMNA locus were isodisomic, while markers in the short arm and distal 1q region were heterodisomic. These results suggest that nondisjunction in maternal meiosis followed by loss of the paternal chromosome 1 during trisomy rescue might result in the UPD1 and homozygosity for the p.M540T mutation observed in this patient.</text></passage></document><document><id>1979</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Recurrent SMARCA4 mutations in small cell carcinoma of the ovary.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>66</offset><text>Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare, highly aggressive form of ovarian cancer primarily diagnosed in young women.

Here, we have investigated nuclear protein spreading and its potential consequences in two of the three most prevalent neuromuscular diseases. By performing co-cultures between diseased or control human myoblasts and murine C2C12 myoblasts, we demonstrate that in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, although the transcription of the toxic protein DUX4 occurs in only a limited number of nuclei, the resulting protein diffuses into nearby nuclei within the myotubes, thus spreading aberrant gene expression. In myotonic dystrophy type 1, we observed that in human-mouse heterokaryons, the expression of a mutated DMPK from human nuclei titrates splicing factors produced by neighboring nuclei, inducing the mis-splicing of several pre-mRNAs in murine nuclei. In both cases, the spreading of the pathological phenotypes from one nucleus to another is observed, highlighting an additional mechanism that contributes to the dissemination and worsening of the muscle pathogenesis. These results indicate that nuclear protein spreading may be an important component of pathophysiology of gain of function muscular diseases which should be taken into consideration in the design of new therapeutic approaches.</text></passage></document><document><id>1981</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Skin tumors with matrical differentiation: lessons from hair keratins, beta-catenin and PHLDA-1 expression.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>108</offset><text>BACKGROUND: Pilomatricomas are tumors that emulate the differentiation of matrix cells of the hair follicle, showing cortical differentiation, with sequential expression of K35 and K31 keratins. Beta-catenin gene is frequently mutated in pilomatricoma, leading to beta-catenin nuclear accumulation, and to downstream expression of LEF1. Skin matrical tumors other than pilomatricoma are very rare, and comprise purely matrical tumors and focally matrical tumors. We aimed at studying cortical differentiation, beta-catenin pathway and expression of the follicular stem-cell marker PHLDA1 in a series of matrical tumors other than pilomatricoma. METHODS: In 36 prospectively collected tumors, K31, K35, CK17, LEF1, HOXC13, beta-catenin and PHLDA1 expressions were evaluated. Five pilomatricomas were used as controls. RESULTS: In 18 purely matrical tumors (11 matrical carcinomas, 4 melanocytic matricomas, 3 matricomas) and 18 focally matrical tumors (11 basal cell carcinomas, 3 trichoepithelioma/trichoblastomas, 4 others), sequential K35, HOXC13 and K31 expressions were found, indicating cortical differentiation. Germinative matrix cells were always CK17-, and showed nuclear beta-catenin accumulation, with LEF1 and PHLDA1 expressions. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear beta-catenin and LEF1 expression was highly conserved in matrical tumors, and suggested a common tumorigenesis driven by Wnt pathway activation. PHLDA1 was consistently expressed in matrical tumors and in areas of matrical differentiation.</text></passage></document><document><id>1982</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Deep sequencing with intronic capture enables identification of an APC exon 10 inversion in a patient with polyposis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>118</offset><text>PURPOSE: Single-exon inversions have rarely been described in clinical syndromes and are challenging to detect using Sanger sequencing. We report the case of a 40-year-old woman with adenomatous colon polyps too numerous to count and who had a complex inversion spanning the entire exon 10 in APC (the gene encoding for adenomatous polyposis coli), causing exon skipping and resulting in a frameshift and premature protein truncation. METHODS: In this study, we employed complete APC gene sequencing using high-coverage next-generation sequencing by ColoSeq, analysis with BreakDancer and SLOPE software, and confirmatory transcript analysis. RESULTS: ColoSeq identified a complex small genomic rearrangement consisting of an inversion that results in translational skipping of exon 10 in the APC gene. This mutation would not have been detected by traditional sequencing or gene-dosage methods. CONCLUSION: We report a case of adenomatous polyposis resulting from a complex single-exon inversion. Our report highlights the benefits of large-scale sequencing methods that capture intronic sequences with high enough depth of coverage-as well as the use of informatics tools-to enable detection of small pathogenic structural rearrangements.Genet Med 16 10, 783-786.</text></passage></document><document><id>1983</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mutants TP53 p.R273H and p.R273C but not p.R273G enhance cancer cell malignancy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset><text>Mutation of the tumor suppressor TP53 gene occurs in greater than half of all human cancers. In addition to loss of tumor suppressor function of wild-type TP53, gain-of-function mutations endow cancer cells with more malignant properties. R273 is a mutation hotspot with the p.R273H, p.R273C, and p.R273G variants occurring most commonly in patient samples. To better understand the consequences of these R273 mutations, we constructed cancer cell lines expressing TP53 p.R273H, p.R273C, or p.R273G and explored their characteristics. We found that p.R273H and p.R273C, but not p.R273G, enhanced proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance in vitro. Furthermore, breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 was upregulated by mutant TP53 p.R273H and p.R273C in response to DNA damage and repair. Transcriptional analysis of the TP53-R273 mutants by RNA-seq confirmed that the apoptosis pathway was less active in p.R273H and p.R273C, compared with R273G. Molecular dynamics simulation further revealed that TP53-R273G binds more tightly to DNA than TP53-R273H or TP53-R273C. These findings indicate that mutation of TP53 at a single codon has different effects, and likely clinical implications. p.R273H and p.R273C lead to a more aggressive phenotype than p.R273G. These findings may contribute to future diagnosis and therapy in TP53 mutant cancers.</text></passage></document><document><id>1984</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with mutation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene despite increased HDL levels. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>149</offset><text>Plasma high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) levels are strongly genetically determined and show a general inverse relationship with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) .

Thus , genetic CETP deficiency appears to be an independent risk factor for CHD , primarily due to increased CHD prevalence in men with the D442G mutation and HDL cholesterol between 41 and 60 mg / dl .

Currently, there is no effective treatment for retinoschisis, though viral vector-mediated gene replacement therapies offer promise. We used intravitreal delivery of three different AAV vectors to target delivery of the RS1 gene to M  ller glia, photoreceptors or multiple cell types throughout the retina. M  ller glia radially span the entire retina, are accessible from the vitreous, and remain intact throughout progression of the disease. However, photoreceptors, not glia, normally secrete retinoschisin. We compared the efficacy of rescue mediated by retinoschisin secretion from these specific subtypes of retinal cells in the Rs1h-/- mouse model of retinoschisis. Our results indicate that all three vectors deliver the RS1 gene, and that several cell types can secrete retinoschisin, leading to transport of the protein across the retina. The greatest long-term rescue was observed when photoreceptors produce retinoschisin. Similar rescue was observed with photoreceptor-specific or generalized expression, although photoreceptor secretion may contribute to rescue in the latter case. These results collectively point to the importance of cell targeting and appropriate vector choice in the success of retinal gene therapies.</text></passage></document><document><id>1986</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of COL3A1 and RAB2A as novel translocation partner genes of PLAG1 in lipoblastoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset><text>Lipoblastoma is a rapidly growing, benign neoplasm in children. Surgical excision is usually curative, with a recurrence rate of about 20%. Because the histology of lipoblastoma is heterogeneous and overlaps with other lipomatous tumors, some lipoblastoma cases have been difficult to diagnose. The detection of PLAG1 gene rearrangement is useful for the diagnosis of lipoblastoma. Three fusion partner genes are known in relation to PLAG1 in lipoblastoma HAS2 at 8q24.1, COL1A2 at 7q22, and RAD51L1 at 14q24. Herein, we describe another two novel fusion genes in lipoblastoma tumor specimens. We checked six tumors for the presence of two known fusion genes, HAS2-PLAG1 and COL1A2-PLAG1. Only HAS2-PLAG1 was found in one of the cases. Next, we attempted to identify potential PLAG1 fusion partners using 5'RACE. Sequence analysis revealed two novel fusion genes, COL3A1-PLAG1 in three cases and RAB2A-PLAG1 in one case, respectively. As a result of the translocations, the constitutively active promoter of the partner gene drives the ectopic expression of PLAG1. We also evaluated whether a high level of PLAG1 expression can be used to help differentiate lipomatous tumors. PLAG1 expression was evaluated by real-time PCR in five lipoblastoma tumor specimens. The expressions were 70-150 times higher in lipoblastomas than in human adipocytes. However, PLAG1 expression was low in one case of lipoma. These results demonstrate that PLAG1 overexpression is a potential marker of lipoblastoma. Our findings, in agreement with previous studies, show that lipoblastoma is a group of lipomatous tumors with PLAG1 rearrangement and overexpression.    2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</text></passage></document><document><id>1987</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Clinical evaluation of a melting curve analysis-based PCR assay for glucose phosphate dehydrogenase gene mutation detection].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of multicolor melting curve analysis(MMCA) for detecting genetic mutations in G6PD deficiency. METHODS: A total of 402 peripheral blood samples(256 males and 146 females) were collected from suspected patients or their relatives at the Prenatal Diagnosis Center of Liuzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital between March 2012 and May 2012. The samples were screened by G6PD/6PGD quantitative ratio testing. The reliability of the assay was evaluated by multiplex probe melting curve assay(which can detect 16 G6PD mutations) and DNA sequencing through a double blind study. RESULTS: One hundred seventy cases with G6PD/6PGD ratio &lt; 1.0 and 232 cases with G6PD/6PGD ratio >=  1.0 were detected by the enzymological method. DNA sequencing has identified 182 wild type samples, 151 hemizygous mutation samples, 5 female homozygous mutation samples, 54 female heterozygous mutation samples and 10 female double heterozygous mutation samples. Multicolor melting curve analysis has detected 185 wild type samples, 148 hemizygous mutation samples, 5 female homozygous mutation samples, 55 female heterozygous mutation samples and 9 female double heterozygous mutation samples. The specificity and sensitivity of G6PD gene mutation detection by multicolor melting curve analysis were 100%(182/182) and 98.6%(217/220), respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 99.5%(216/217) and 98.4%(182/185), respectively, and the Youden's index was 0.986. The concordance rate of the sample detection between the melting curve assay and DNA sequencing was 99.0%(398/402). Twenty-one different genotypes were detected by the multicolor melting curve analysis and 24 different genotypes were detected by DNA sequencing. Four samples containing mutations(c.196T>A or c.406C>T) were not detected by multicolor melting curve analysis, which can be attributed to different technical settings of the two methods. CONCLUSION: Multicolor melting curve analysis for G6PD gene mutation detection is a simple, rapid, sensitive and specific method, which can be used for clinical diagnosis of G6PD deficiency.</text></passage></document><document><id>1988</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Wilms tumor: an update.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>24</offset><text>Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common neoplasm of the kidney in children. It is an embryologic tumor that histologically mimics renal embryogenesis and is composed of a variable mixture of stromal, blastemal, and epithelial elements. Nephrogenic rests, generally considered to be precursor lesions of the WT, are foci of the embryonic metanephric tissue that persist after the completion of renal embryogenesis. These are classified as perilobar and intralobar based on their location and maybe present as single or multiple foci. Intralobar and perilobar rests and the tumors arising from these rests differ morphologically and are characterized by 2 different sets of genetic abnormalities involving 2 adjacent foci, WT1 and WT2, on the short arm of chromosome 11. WTs arising in the intralobar rests tend to be stromal predominant and have a mutation or deletion of WT1. Germline mutation in WT1 may be associated with syndromic conditions such as WAGR and Denys-Drash syndromes. Perilobar rests and their corresponding tumors usually have loss of imprinting/loss of heterozygosity involving WT2, which contains several parentally imprinted genes. Loss of function of these genes, if present constitutionally, may be associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or may result in isolated hypertrophy. Abnormalities in several other genes may also be seen in WT. These include WTX, (on chromosome X), CTNNB1 (chromosome 3), and TP53 (chromosome 17) among others. WT with loss of heterozygosity at 1p and 16q may have poor prognosis, requiring aggressive therapy. Treatment modalities for WT have evolved over many decades, primarily through the efforts of Dr J Bruce Beckwith at National WT study. This work is now being carried out by Children Oncology Group in North America and International Society of Pediatric Oncology in Europe. Although their therapeutic approaches are somewhat different, both have reported excellent results with equally high cure rates.</text></passage></document><document><id>1989</id><infon key="annotator_ids">[6]</infon><infon key="n_annotators">1</infon><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a novel nonsense mutation and a missense substitution in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene in two Spanish kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>186</offset><text>Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( FNDI ) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) encoded by the AVP-neurophysin II ( AVP-NPII ) gene on chromosome 20p13 .

The combination of serum iron, transferrin saturation and serum ferritin determination will detect iron overload in an early, precirrhotic stage. Liver biopsy and the determination of hepatic iron concentration provide the definitive proof. Where HC is recognized sufficiently early to permit adequate removal of iron before cirrhosis has developed, the prognosis is excellent. Thus haemochromatosis as a clinical disease should be preventable in a large proportion of patients. Severe iron overload has been described in juveniles and also in neonates. These conditions are familial but whether they are HLA-related has not been determined. Cardiac and endocrine disorders are frequently the presenting manifestations of parenchymal iron overload in the young and, at least in neonates, the condition is usually fatal in early infancy. It is not possible at present, to say whether these rare juvenile and neonatal forms of haemochromatosis are related to the much more common adult form.

There is increasing evidence that there exist germ-line variants of the APC gene that predispose to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinoma , but without the florid phenotype of classical FAP , and possibly with importance for colorectal cancer risk in the general population . . </text></passage></document><document><id>1998</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Targeted correction of a major histocompatibility class II E alpha gene by DNA microinjected into mouse eggs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>110</offset><text>DNA molecules containing the 5' end of a functional major histocompatibility class II E alpha gene were injected into mouse eggs bearing E alpha genes with 630-base-pair (bp) deletions encompassing the promoter and first exon. The deletion was corrected by homologous recombination in 1 of about 500 transgenic mice that incorporated the injected DNA. The corrected E alpha gene was transmitted to progeny, which were bred to homozygosity. Southern blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction amplification of the DNA spanning the deletion, and sequence analysis revealed that the corrected allele resembles the wild-type E alpha gene. At sites of single-base-pair polymorphisms, there was apparently random conversion to either the donor or recipient sequence. In addition, many point mutations were introduced. mRNAs were produced from the corrected allele in a tissue-specific manner, but their sizes were different from the wild-type allele, and they did not produce detectable E alpha protein. This experiment demonstrates the feasibility of targeting foreign DNA to a gene that is completely inactive in fertilized mouse eggs.</text></passage></document><document><id>1999</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Prenatal and perinatal diagnosis of peroxisomal disorders.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>59</offset><text>Peroxisomes play an essential role in human cellular metabolism. Peroxisomal disorders, a group of genetic diseases caused by peroxisomal dysfunction, can be classified into three groups: (1) disorders of peroxisome biogenesis with a generalized loss of peroxisomal functions (Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, hyperpipecolic acidaemia); (2) disorders with a loss of multiple peroxisomal functions (rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and Zellweger-like syndrome; (3) disorders with loss of a single peroxisomal function (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, peroxisomal thiolase deficiency, bifunctional protein deficiency, acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency, classic Refsum disease, hyperoxaluria type I and acatalasaemia). Prenatal diagnosis is indicated in all these genetic disorders with the exception of classic Refsum disease, most types of hyperoxaluria type I and acatalasaemia. A variety of techniques is available now for the prenatal diagnosis of peroxisomal disorders in the first or second trimester of gestation. Prenatal diagnosis was performed by us in 70 pregnancies at risk for a disorder of peroxisome biogenesis, three for rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, four for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and two for a defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Fourteen affected fetuses were identified; no false negative cases were obtained.</text></passage></document><document><id>2000</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[The May-Hegglin anomaly in a family].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>39</offset></passage></document><document><id>2001</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Cytogenetic characterization of a colon adenocarcinoma from a familial polyposis coli patient.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>95</offset><text>We report on the cytogenetic findings in a fresh biopsy of a colorectal adenocarcinoma in a patient with familial polyposis coli (FAP).

The gene, which is present in a single copy in the chicken genome, is 18 kilobase pairs long and comprises eight exons and seven introns. It has two transcription initiation sites, 8 base pairs from each other. A sequence very homologous to the consensus nuclear factor III binding-site sequence, a CAT- and a TATA-like sequence are found in the promoter region and ATTAAA is used as a polyadenylation signal. The nucleotide sequence defines a primary translation product of 493 amino acids which consists of a 23-amino acid signal peptide and two large repeated domains connected by an epidermal growth factor module. Amino acid sequences homologous to those of the repeated domains are present in the type A repeats of von Willebrand factor, complement factors B and C2, and in the alpha chains of the integrins Mac-1, p150,95, and LFA-1. The exon-intron structure indicates that the CMP gene may have arisen by exon duplication and exon shuffling during evolution. The GT-AG splice rule cannot be applied for the excision of the last intron of the CMP pre-mRNA. The donor splice site of intron G is basically different from the consensus sequence indicating that a novel type of splicing mechanism might exist in cartilage.</text></passage></document><document><id>2003</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Aarskog syndrome in Hungary.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>29</offset></passage></document><document><id>2004</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Comparison of gamma-radiation-induced accumulation of ataxia telangiectasia and control cells in G2 phase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Recent reports from a number of laboratories have linked radiosensitivity in ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) to a large and prolonged block of some cells in G2 phase.

We describe here a study of the effect of gamma-radiation on G2 phase delay in several A-T cell lines. Based on previous results with several cell lines 24 h post irradiation was selected as the optimum time to discriminate between G2 phase delay in control and A-T cells. All A-T homozygotes showed a significantly greater number of cells in G2 phase, 24 h post irradiation, than observed in controls. A more prolonged delay in G2 phase after irradiation was seen in different A-T cell types that included lymphoblastoid cells, fibroblasts and SV40-transformed fibroblasts. At the radiation dose used it was not possible to distinguish A-T heterozygotes from controls.</text></passage></document><document><id>2005</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>CpG island clones from a deletion encompassing the gene for adenomatous polyposis coli.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a dominantly inherited disorder, has been mapped to chromosome 5q15-q21 by family linkage studies.

The identification and characterization of additional DNA probes closely linked to the DM locus continue to be priorities. In this study, we report on the linkage between a new DNA marker, designated p alpha 1.4P, and the DM locus in 50 families. The probe p alpha 1.4P was derived from a cloned breakpoint junction fragment from the chromosomal translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13.1). This translocation has been previously described in some cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We have identified a BanI restriction fragment length polymorphism that is detected by p alpha 1.4P. Segregation analysis between this RFLP and DM revealed close linkage between the two loci (lod = 10.95, theta = 0). Furthermore, statistical evidence for linkage disequilibrium between p alpha 1.4P and the DM locus in a French Canadian population was found. Finally, by means of a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, p alpha 1.4P was sublocalized to 19q12----19q13.2.</text></passage></document><document><id>2010</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Norrie disease: linkage analysis using a 4.2-kb RFLP detected by a human ornithine aminotransferase cDNA probe.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>112</offset><text>Previous study has shown that the usual DNA marker for Norrie disease, the L1.28 probe which identifies the DXS7 locus, can recombine with the disease locus. In this study, we used a human ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) cDNA which detects OAT-related DNA sequences mapped to the same region on the X chromosome as that of the L1.28 probe to investigate the family with Norrie disease who exhibited the recombinational event. When genomic DNA from this family was digested with the PvuII restriction endonuclease, we found a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 4.2 kb in size. This fragment was absent in the affected males and cosegregated with the disease locus; we calculated a lod score of 0.602, at theta = 0.00. No deletion could be detected by chromosomal analysis or on Southern blots with other enzymes. These results suggest that one of the OAT-related sequences on the X chromosome may be in close proximity to the Norrie disease locus and represent the first report which indicates that the OAT cDNA may be useful for the identification of carrier status and/or prenatal diagnosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>2011</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Restriction fragment length polymorphisms within proximal 15q and their use in molecular cytogenetics and the Prader-Willi syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>133</offset><text>Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) are described in detail for 6 DNA probes (D15S9-13, D15S18) that localize to the proximal long arm of human chromosome 15 (15q11-15q13: this report and Tantravahi et al., Am. J. Med. Genet. 33:78-87. Multiple RFLPs are detected by the probe that identifies locus D15S13, and these RFLPs are shown by genomic mapping to result from a nearby insertion or deletion of 1.8 kilobases (kb) of DNA. This set of RFLPs detected by proximal 15q probes can be used for studies on the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and on mentally retarded individuals with a supernumerary inv dup(15) chromosome. Five of the polymorphic loci (D15S9-13) map to the region implicated in the cause of the PWS (15q11.2-15q12). Each of 4 families tested with these probes, as well as an additional "PWS-like" patient, was informative by RFLP analysis. The two PWS deletions studied, which occurred de novo, were inherited from the chromosome 15 provided by the father. By contrast, the 2 inv dup(15) chromosomes analyzed were of maternal origin. The use of RFLPs can also simplify the molecular determination of copy number in chromosomal aneuploidy, as exemplified by analysis of individuals with the PWS and a deletion, patients with an inv dup(15), and one patient with a more complex rearrangement involving chromosome 15. Our studies demonstrate the application of DNA probes for both molecular cytogenetic studies on this chromosome region and the development of diagnostic molecular markers to aid early clinical diagnosis of the PWS.</text></passage></document><document><id>2012</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Advances in the study of inherited metabolic disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>54</offset></passage></document><document><id>2013</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hypervariable microsatellite for genetic diagnosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset></passage></document><document><id>2014</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Individuals with IgA deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency share polymorphisms of major histocompatibility complex class III genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>142</offset><text>IgA deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency are heritable disorders that can occur within the same family.

In search of a genetic linkage between the two immunodeficiencies, we examined the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III genes encoding complement components C2, C4A, and C4B and steroid 21-hydroxylase in addition to the HLA serotypes in individuals with either common variable immunodeficiency or IgA deficiency. Twelve of 19 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (63%, P less than 0.001) and 9 of 16 patients with IgA deficiency (56%, P less than 0.01) had rare C2 alleles and/or C4A and 21-hydroxylase A deletions, whereas these gene features were seen in only 5 of 34 healthy individuals (15%) in the control group. Nine of 11 patients with C4A deletion had an HLA haplotype consistent with the MHC supratype HLA-A1, Cw7, B8, C4AQ0, C4B1, BfS, DR3 previously found to be associated with IgA deficiency.

The early recognition of the condition is essential because the insertion of a cardiac pacemaker can be life saving. The disorder is usually inherited as an X linked recessive trait (linked to DNA markers around Xq28). However, occasionally it can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and there is an indication that this and the X linked form may in some cases have a neurogenic basis. For these reasons it has recently been proposed that the appellation 'Emery-Dreifuss syndrome' be used for this triad of symptoms and signs.</text></passage></document><document><id>2027</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Inherited sensitivity to X-rays in man.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>40</offset><text>Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), an inherited disorder giving radiation sensitivity and cancer-proneness, is discussed in terms of a defect in ability to repair DNA damage.

The prominent findings are large pigment granules from 3.5 to 8 microns protruding towards the apical cellular surface. These macromelanosomes do not exhibit coalescence as noted by others, but show a concentric lamellar structure that may be the result of a disturbed development sequence in melanin granule formation. The authors' observation of CHRPE in a newborn and in an infant suggests that the term congenital HRPE is appropriate. The presence of these changes at this early age is consistent with the condition being a primary failure of differentiation.

Thus, our data do not support the conclusions of others regarding the existence of a "hotspot" for deletion breakpoints in this gene. In 4 of the tumors, we sequenced 200 base pairs surrounding each deletion breakpoint. Three deletions had termini within pairs of short, direct repeats ranging in size from 4 to 7 base pairs. These results indicate that the "slipped mispairing" mechanism may predominate in the generation of deletions at this locus. Our review of deletion breakpoints at other genetic loci reveals that the nature of the sequences present at deletion breakpoints (short, direct repeats versus middle repetitive elements) varies according to the genetic locus under study.</text></passage></document><document><id>2035</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Aspartylglucosamine excretion in heterozygous carriers of aspartylglycosaminuria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset></passage></document><document><id>2036</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>G6PD Vientiane: a new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant with increased stability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>A new G6PD variant, called G6PD Vientiane, has been discovered in a patient from Laos.

The entire primary structure of C6 was determined by sequencing C6 cDNA that was cloned from a human liver lambda gt11 library. The polypeptide chain of C6 contains 913 amino acids. The protein is homologous with the other terminal components of complement, C7-C9. Specifically, C6 has 29% of its residues identical with C7, and 55 of the 56 cysteines found in C7 match those in C6. The C6 polypeptide chain is cross-linked by 32 disulfide bonds, and most of the cysteines are located in short (34-77 amino acids) discrete segments that exhibit homology with a wide variety of other proteins such as thrombospondin, the low density lipoprotein receptor, epidermal growth factor, and complement factors H and I. C6 is a glycoprotein, and it has two oligosaccharide groups attached to asparagines located near the amino and the carboxyl termini of the molecule. The organization of secondary structural elements in C6 was elucidated using circular dichroism spectroscopy and an empirical method based on sequence analysis. C6 has an estimated 12% alpha-helix, but is comparatively richer in beta-sheet (29%) and beta-turns (21%). Most of the predicted alpha-helical structure resides in a portion of the polypeptide chain that is free of cysteine and which shares homology with C9 and perforin. The tertiary structure of the C6 molecule was visualized by transmission electron microscopy; it has a sickle shape with dimensions of 144 x 66 A. The combined results are discussed and comparisons made with the other late acting components of complement and perforin.</text></passage></document><document><id>2044</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[A case of congenital myotonic dystrophy with infantile autism].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset><text>An 11-year-old girl with congenital myotonic dystrophy and infantile autism was reported. Her mother also suffered from typical myotonic dystrophy. Since her birth, the patient had been floppy, and showed bilateral talipes equinus at 1 year of age. Her subsequent psychomotor and speech development has been retarded. She showed autistic behavior and persistence to the sameness before 2 years old. She was admitted to Sawarabien at the age of 10 years. She could not talk anything but could understand simple, oral messages. Although she had severe degree of mental retardation, her ability for matching figures was relatively well reserved. Her autism was so manifest that it could not be explained by the degree of mental retardation. Neurological examinations revealed that she had facial diplegia, inverted V-shaped mouth, high-arched palate, talipes equinus, percussion myotonia of the tongue, generalized muscular atrophy and weakness, lordosis, areflexia, and congenital cataracta. The serum CPK was slightly elevated. EMG showed a myopathic pattern but did not show any myotonic discharge yet. The brachioradial muscle was biopsied and examined by light- and electron-microscopy. It mainly showed mild varieties of muscle fiber diameter and internal nuclei. Ultrastructurally, irregularly indented central nuclei and perinuclear degeneration of myofibrils associated with secondary lysosomes, lipid droplets and glycogen granules were revealed. Ventricular dilatation and some dysfunction of the brain were also revealed by CT scan and EEG respectively. The present case suggests that congenital myotonic dystrophy can be added into the disease group associated with infantile autism.</text></passage></document><document><id>2045</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Recent trends in studies on carcinogenesis in familial adenomatous polyposis].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>80</offset><text>Familial adenomatous polyposis is rare disease, but it is considered as the most important clinical model for studying cancer control and carcinogenesis in general, by its extremely high risk for colorectal cancer as well as for malignancies of diverse organs which is transmitted by autosomal dominant mode.

The recent studies by Bodmer et al and by Solomon et al which reported on FAP locus in chromosome 5 and on loss of heterozygosity of this locus in the colorectal cancer have made an important break through in proving the Knudson's hypothesis.

U.S.A. 82, 2024-2028] and two additional full-length cDNAs overlapping with p16 alpha-1 (p16 alpha-2 and p16 alpha-16) were sequenced. p16 alpha-2 contained a single open reading frame of 1512 nucleotides, consisting of 71 base pairs of the 5'-noncoding region and 63 base pairs of the 3'-noncoding region with an additional poly(A) tract. From this DNA sequence, C-P-450(16) alpha was deduced to contain 504 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56,948 daltons. p16 alpha-1 showed a nucleotide sequence identical with that of p16 alpha-2 but lacked nine amino acid residues from the N-terminus. Another cDNA clone, p16 alpha-16, also exhibited the same coding sequence with the exception of a 142 base pair deletion spanning from nucleotide 853 to nucleotide 994 of p16 alpha-2. This deletion seems to be a whole exon of this gene, resulting in a shift of reading frame and an early termination codon at 10 amino acid residues from the deletion. The expected translation product of this mRNA is calculated to be 294 amino acids and 33,300 daltons.

In the encephalomyopathic form, RRF were seen in 5 of 12 muscles mostly in patients more than 6 years of age.

The size of this contiguous region is such that the X-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mouse mutation probably maps within this segment. This in turn suggests that it is highly improbable that the mouse mdx locus represents a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It is, however, compatible with the idea that this mutation may correspond in man to Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. The high frequency of restriction fragment length polymorphisms found in this interspecific system for all the human cross-reacting probes examined up until now, using only a limited number of restriction enzymes, suggests that the Mus spretus mapping system may be of great potential value for establishing the linkage relationships existing in man when conserved chromosomal regions are concerned and human/mouse cross-reacting probes are available or can be obtained.</text></passage></document><document><id>2057</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mapping the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>51</offset><text>The X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is triggered by Epstein-Barr virus infection and results in fatal mononucleosis, immunodeficiency, and lymphoproliferative disorders.

Kunkel and his colleagues isolated genomic sequences (PERT 87) from within a large deletion causing DMD, whereas our group isolated genomic sequences (XJ) spanning the junction of an X-autosome translocation causing the disease. Chromosome walking by both groups has led to the isolation of over 400 kilobases of the PERT 87 and XJ region. Subclones of PERT 87 and XJ reveal restriction fragment length polymorphisms that segregate with the DMD gene in 95% of meioses, and fail to hybridize with DNA from about 8% of male patients. Selected subclones of PERT 87 and XJ contain exons that hybridize to muscle-derived complementary DNA (cDNA) clones. The cDNA clones detect a large (16 kilobase) message. Analysis of deletions, mutations and translocations suggests a DMD gene of between two million and three million base pairs. The clones obtained so far are useful for attempts to generate antibody against the gene product and for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis.</text></passage></document><document><id>2064</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic evidence from two families that the apolipoprotein B gene is not involved in abetalipoproteinemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>107</offset><text>Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a recessive disorder in which affected individuals have extremely low or undetectable levels of serum apo B-containing lipoproteins.

Congenital absence of one of the terminal proteins in the complement system impairs a patient's ability to eradicate bacteria, and increases susceptibility to recurring infections caused by meningococci and other Neisseria species. Though the serum of complement-deficient patients promotes normal opsonization of bacteria, it is unable to kill meningococci directly. The currently available meningococcal vaccine may augment type-specific antibody, but it does not correct the underlying complement deficiency. The role of self-administered antibiotics in preventing recurrent Neisseria infection remains uncertain.</text></passage></document><document><id>2067</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Allele loss at the c-Ha-ras1 locus in human ovarian cancer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>60</offset><text>Recent reports have shown allele loss at the c-Ha-ras1 locus on the short arm of chromosome 11 in some types of tumors. To determine whether loss of heterozygosity occurs at the c-Ha-ras1 locus in uncultured human ovarian carcinomas we used Southern blot analysis to study DNA from 17 pairs of ovarian tumors and matched white blood cell samples from the same patients. In one of these 17 tumors, the c-Ha-ras1 locus was rearranged, and in five tumor DNAs from ten informative patients, a c-Ha-ras1 allele was lost. This loss, of relatively high incidence, appears to be an important characteristic of human ovarian cancer and may provide a useful tool for understanding its biological behavior.</text></passage></document><document><id>2068</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Obesity and abnormal behaviour associated with interstitial deletion of chromosome 18 (q12.2q21.1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>100</offset></passage></document><document><id>2069</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Differentiation between papillary and nonpapillary renal cell carcinomas by DNA analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset><text>Recent studies have shown that the deletion of chromosome 3p or the loss of DNA sequences at 3p is generally associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, chromosome analysis of some papillary RCCs suggested that this type of tumor differs genotypically from the most common nonpapillary RCCs. Therefore, by using cytogenetic and molecular genetic approaches, we examined human papillary and nonpapillary RCCs for the loss of heterozygosity or homozygosity at the short arm of chromosome 3. The constitutional heterozygosity for the DNF15S2 locus and for one allele of the c-erbA beta and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogenes was lost in nonpapillary RCCs, whereas both alleles were retained in each papillary RCC analyzed. We conclude that the loss of DNA sequences at the chromosome 3p region is a genomic change occurring consistently in nonpapillary RCCs, but never occurring in papillary RCCs.</text></passage></document><document><id>2070</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nucleotide sequence of the cynomolgus monkey apolipoprotein E cDNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset></passage></document><document><id>2071</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The golden tapetal sheen reflex in retinal disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset><text>A mother and son with dominant cone dystrophy manifested the retinal reflexes seen in Oguchi's disease (mother) and the carrier female of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (son).

The other, found in a non-Jewish man, was characterized by uniformly low levels of HEX A activity in leukocytes, fibroblasts, and serum against artificial substrate. In all cases, the pH optimum of HEX A was normal, there was no increased lability at 37 degrees C, and no inhibitor was detected to account for the deficiency of activity. Cultured fibroblasts of these individuals were capable of synthesizing and processing alpha- and beta-subunits of HEX A and capable of cleaving GM2 ganglioside. The patients, ranging in age from 6 to 30 years, are clinically normal.

We have studied the effect of caffeine on the expression of the fra(X) and common folate-dependent fragile sites in PBLC from two fra(X) expressing individuals and in five lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) established from individuals in families in which the fra(X) is segregating. Caffeine did not enhance the expression of the fra(X) in the PBLC or in the three LCL from fra(X) expressing individuals nor did it elicit fra(X) expression in LCL from a non-expressing obligate-carrier female and a transmitting male. However, in all cultures there was a marked increase of common fragile site expression due to caffeine treatment.

The estimates have been made directly, with data from 22,043 Jewish and 32,342 non-Jewish individuals measured for total serum hexosaminidase activity and the heat-labile fraction. These values have been shown to identify potential carriers of the Sandhoff allele(s) with 95% sensitivity. Subsequent leukocyte assays of total hexosaminidase activity and the heat-labile fraction in those identified in serum tests have been shown to provide a much finer discrimination between those who carry the allele(s) and those who do not. Results from such assays were used to generate these carrier frequency estimates. Carrier frequency estimates have also been made indirectly from Sandhoff disease incidence data collected during the period 1979-84. These estimates are in agreement with data for the Jewish population under analysis, but in the non-Jewish population the estimate derived from data on screened individuals is greater than the estimate derived from incidence figures. The possible causes for such a difference are discussed. In a study of non-Jewish individuals each of whose grandparents derives from a single country of origin, the distribution of countries among Sandhoff disease carriers differs significantly from that in the non-Jewish sample under analysis, indicating possible ethnic groups with increased or decreased carrier frequencies. These analyses suggest an increased Sandhoff disease carrier frequency among Mexican and Central-American populations and a decreased carrier frequency among non-Jewish German populations.</text></passage></document><document><id>2077</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Linkage of G8 (D4S10) in two Swedish families with Huntington's disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>73</offset><text>Two Swedish families with Huntington's disease (HD) have been investigated for linkage with G8 (D4S10).

The lod scores were 1.531 for Family 1 and 2.057 for Family 2, and the combined lod score was 3.59. The HD gene was segregating with the haplotype C in Family 1 and with haplotype A in Family 2. The predictive value of the test was obvious. Before the testing with the G8 probe, 84.2% of the family members in Family 1 had a theoretical risk of 25% or 50% of having the HD gene. After the testing with the G8 probe, only 23.7% of the family members remained at the same risk, and it could also be certified that 63.2% had no or little risk of having the HD gene.

The diagnosis was initially obscured by a lack of family history due to the early death of both parents and siblings. The presence of symptoms at the age of 59 in one offspring is consistent with the intrafamilial transmission of late onset HD disease. The early neuropsychometric data were consistent with the cognitive changes of HD, particularly with the loss of higher cognitive functions, memory and the relative decline in the performance IQ with the preservation of language skills. The psychiatric symptoms of emotional lability and apathy were also congruent with the diagnosis of HD. The atypical features of this patient's course, including progressively severe dementia, seizures and rigidity, may have provided clinical clues to the coexistence of both AD and HD. The absence of caudate atrophy on serial CT scans in this patient, although inconsistent with the gross findings reported on postmortem exam, perhaps could be explained by the 3 1/2-year interval between the last CT scan and death. Further, it has been noted previously that pathological changes tend to lag behind the clinical manifestations of the disease. The pathologic findings on autopsy were confirmatory for the presence of both AD and HD in this patient. Genetic counseling for this family is now most appropriate.</text></passage></document><document><id>2079</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Serum complement activation pathways and circulating anti-streptolysin-0 antibodies: diagnostic value in glomerulonephritis in children].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>139</offset></passage></document><document><id>2080</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Feline glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cellular mosaicism.

The early stages of this process are difficult to study because of the lack of sensitive and specific markers of clonal evolution in an experimental system. We have developed a cat model using cellular mosaicism for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). Our findings confirm that the structural locus for feline G-6-PD is on the X-chromosome and demonstrate that it is randomly inactivated in somatic cells. Heterozygous cats have balanced ratios of G-6-PD enzyme types in peripheral blood cells and hematopoietic progenitors that remain stable over time. In our initial studies, we used the model to analyze the events surrounding marrow failure experimentally induced by selected strains of feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Two G-6-PD heterozygous cats, one F1 male hybrid and one domestic cat were infected with FeLV (C or KT) and developed pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Colonies arising from the more mature erythroid colony-forming cell were not detected in marrow culture of anemic animals although erythroid bursts persisted, suggesting that the differentiation of early erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) was inhibited in vivo. The ratio of G-6-PD types in hematopoietic progenitors and peripheral blood cells from the heterozygous cats did not change when the animals developed PRCA. Thus, the anemia did not result from the clonal expansion of a transformed myeloid stem cell. With this experimental approach, one may prospectively assess clonal evolution and cellular interactions in other FeLV-induced diseases.</text></passage></document><document><id>2081</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic locus (stmF) associated with cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity in Dictyostelium discoideum maps in linkage group II.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>129</offset><text>Previous attempts to map the stmF locus in Dictyostelium discoideum, by using only clone morphology as a marker, have led to equivocal results.

(1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2501-2508). Southern hybridization of human genomic DNA with an opal suppressor tRNA probe suggested that the gene and pseudogene are present in single copy. In this study, we have determined the chromosome location of the human gene and pseudogene by utilizing a 193-base pair fragment encoding the opal suppressor phosphoserine tRNA gene as probe to examine DNAs isolated from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids that have segregated human chromosomes. These studies show that the probe hybridized with two regions in the human genome; one is located on chromosome 19 and the second on chromosome 22. By comparing the restriction sites within these two regions to those previously determined for the human opal suppressor phosphoserine tRNA gene and pseudogene, we tentatively assigned the gene to chromosome 19 and the pseudogene to chromosome 22. These assignments were confirmed by utilizing a 350-base pair fragment which was isolated from the 5'-flanking region of the human gene as probe. This fragment hybridized only to chromosome 19, demonstrating unequivocally that the opal suppressor phosphoserine tRNA gene is located on chromosome 19. The flanking probe hybridized to a single homologous band in hamster and in mouse DNA to which the gene probe also hybridized, demonstrating that the 5'-flanking region of the opal suppressor tRNA gene is conserved in mammals. Restriction analysis of DNAs obtained from the white blood cells of 10 separate individuals demonstrates that the gene is polymorphic. This study provides two additional markers for the human genome and constitutes only the second set of two tRNA genes assigned to human chromosomes.</text></passage></document><document><id>2093</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Primary dystonias: a review of the pathology and suggestions for new directions of study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>90</offset></passage></document><document><id>2094</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Update: Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>37</offset></passage></document><document><id>2095</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Emery-Dreifuss disease.

Moreover, an Mab directed at the CD4 molecule (66.1) inhibited OKT3-induced T4 but not T8 cell proliferation, whereas an Mab directed at the CD8 molecule (OKT8) inhibited T8 but not T4 cell responses. With the exception of 66.1, each inhibited OKT3-induced T cell proliferation when added as late as 15 hr after the initiation of culture. Inhibition could not be explained by competition for Fc receptors on the AC. A variety of other Mab including OKT11 and those directed at other HLA-DR and DQ determinants were not inhibitory. The inhibitory Mab were found to diminish T4 cell IL 2 production and IL 2 receptor expression. Consequently, IL 2 reversed some but not all of the Mab-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation. In contrast to the effects noted with M phi-supported responses, 60.3 and 66.1 but neither L243 nor 4F2 inhibited OKT3-induced T4 cell proliferation supported by Ia- or IFN-gamma-treated Ia+ endothelial cells. None of the Mab tested inhibited T cell proliferation induced by the AC-independent stimuli OKT3 and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or calcium ionophore and PMA in the presence or absence of added AC. The data therefore suggest that the Mab inhibit OKT3-induced activation of T4 and T8 cells by preventing necessary interactions between AC and T cell surface proteins. Moreover, the results suggest that different arrays of interaction molecules are involved in OKT3-induced T cell proliferation depending on the nature of the AC and the responding T cell subset.</text></passage></document><document><id>2100</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Norrie-Warburg syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>25</offset></passage></document><document><id>2101</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Acquired von Willebrand's syndrome due to an inhibitor of IgG specific for von Willebrand's factor in polycythemia rubra vera.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>127</offset><text>A patient with acquired von Willebrand's syndrome associated with polycythemia rubra vera is described.

Transient increase of vWF:Ag after DDAVP infusion showed less anodic forms and in the relative proportion as normal plasma.

The gene for von Hippel-Lindau syndrome has not yet been localized and the cytogenetics of this cancer-prone genetic disease have not been fully explored. Therefore, we did high-resolution chromosome banding of lymphocytes from patients from 14 kindreds with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. There were 18 patients (eight male, and ten female). None of the male patients showed a detectable chromosome abnormality. However, three of the ten female patients had 45,X/46,XX/47,XXX chromosome mosaicism with predominance of the normal cell line. Fragile sites at 10q25 and 16q22 were found but both segregated independently of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The location of this disease gene, thus, is still unknown. The tendency to chromosome mosaicism manifest in this study suggests that there is a possible error in controlling somatic chromosome division and that error in mitosis may be causally related to the predisposition to tumor formation in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.</text></passage></document><document><id>2106</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Some retinoblastomas, osteosarcomas, and soft tissue sarcomas may share a common etiology.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset><text>DNA and RNA were extracted from primary human osteosarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas obtained from patients without retinoblastoma and were analyzed by hybridization with a cDNA probe for RB mRNA; absence or alterations of the RB gene are associated with development of retinoblastoma.

Mutant mice exhibit a golden coat color on the agouti background, easily distinguishable from the darker wild type. The golden phenotype segregates as an autosomal recessive, showing no linkage to the sex-linked enzyme marker glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Obligate heterozygotes are phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type. At birth, homozygotes have poorly pigmented eyes, which darken with age to become indistinguishable from the wild type. Pigmentation of the ears, tail, and footpads is reduced in intensity. Preliminary studies indicate that the phenotype may be due to an alteration in the shape and pigmentation of the eumelanosomes. The viability and fertility of both heterozygotes and homozygotes, as measured by litter size, sex ratio, or frequency of survival to weaning, appear to be normal for M. caroli. Spectrophotometric analysis of hair samples from the mouse variant at the putative golden locus (gdn) suggests that this mutant is not homologous to at least six independent pigment mutants previously identified in M. musculus.</text></passage></document><document><id>2108</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Increase in surface expression of transferrin receptors on cultured hepatocytes of adult rats in response to iron deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>126</offset><text>The effect of changes in cellular iron metabolism on the surface expression of transferrin receptors (TfR) was examined in primary cultures of hepatocytes from adult rats. Untreated control hepatocytes exhibited a single class of high affinity receptors for transferrin (KD = 40 nM), with approximately 17,000-18,000 receptors per cell. Following 24 h of treatment with the iron chelator, desferrioxamine, or with succinylacetone, an inhibitor of heme synthesis, the number of TfR at the cell surface was increased severalfold, with no significant change in receptor affinity (KD) for transferrin. When combined, the enhancing effects of the two agents were additive. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide abolished the increase in TfR expression mediated by either agent. Hemin decreased surface TfR expression and counteracted the enhancing effects of desferrioxamine or succinylacetone on TfR expression. These results indicate that, under the culture conditions employed, 1) iron deficiency induces an increase in surface TfR and 2) modulation of the receptor population is mainly dependent on de novo synthesis of TfR.</text></passage></document><document><id>2109</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A new variant form of phenylketonuria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>39</offset><text>We report a family (parents and two sets of twin girls) in which the propositus presented as a case of phenylketonuria with a somewhat less severe degree of phenylalanine intolerance than occurs in patients with classical phenylketonuria and whose phenylalanine tolerance was further impaired by giving cotrimoxazole. The trimethoprim component of cotrimoxazole reduces the phenylalanine tolerance of normal subjects but does not augment the degree of phenylalanine intolerance in patients with classical phenylketonuria. The results of the present study of the phenylalanine tolerance and the way in which cotrimoxazole modifies it in the members of this family are compatible with the segregation of an abnormal gene which causes a previously unrecognized type of phenylketonuria when it is present in the homozygous state.

We have isolated a cloned segment of the gene for chick 14K type beta-galactoside-binding lectin from a genomic DNA library. Analysis of the structure of the cloned gene as well as the results of genomic Southern blot hybridization revealed that the gene is unique and that the mRNA for the lectin is encoded by four exons separated by three introns. The whole sequence spans 3.1 kilobases in the gene. The first exon encodes only two amino acid residues of the N-terminus of the mature protein and the other three exons encode, respectively, one of the three repeating sequences found in this lectin. These facts strongly support the idea that gene duplications have occurred during the evolution of this lectin. The previous study (Y. Ohyama et al. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 134, 51-56) suggested that this lectin is not synthesized as a precursor molecule with a cleavable signal sequence at its amino terminus, although it is known to be secreted into the extracellular matrix. Sequence determination of the upstream region of the mRNA indicated that the ATG located just before the codon for the N-terminal amino acid of the mature protein is the actual translation initiator. Thus it was proved that this lectin is synthesized without an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence, as suggested before.</text></passage></document><document><id>2114</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Leukoencephalopathy in HTLV-I-associated myelopathy: MRI and EEG data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>71</offset><text>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and electroencephalography (EEG) were carried out for patients with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy (HAM).

Thirteen patients showed high signal intensity lesions scattered in the cerebral white matter, as seen on the T2-weighted MRI images. The lesions were mostly located in the subcortical and deep cerebral white matter and were not contiguous with the lateral ventricles. Patients with abnormalities on the brain MRI had a longer duration of disease and a greater disability than did those without MRI abnormalities.

This is surprising because in the LDL receptor the same sequence is precisely bounded by introns, and it has been assumed that this sequence is present in both proteins as a result of exon shuffling. We deduce that substantial rearrangement of the exon-intron structure of the C9 gene must have occurred before the exchange of cysteine-rich domains, possibly linked to the process of exon duplication which was required to generate the repeats in the LDL receptor.</text></passage></document><document><id>2116</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Type II collagen deficiency in achondrogenesis (Langer-Saldino).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>65</offset></passage></document><document><id>2117</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in a Druze family].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset></passage></document><document><id>2118</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Central sensory and motor conduction in adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) and tabes dorsalis].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>163</offset></passage></document><document><id>2119</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Regional mapping of the creatine kinase b (CKBB) gene in rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and man using a rat cDNA probe.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>120</offset><text>Using a rat creatine kinase (brain form) cDNA clone for in situ hybridization, we have localized the gene in both the human and the rabbit complement.

This cell line, J1, does not appear to segregate human chromosome 11 during growth. A series of deletion segregants were isolated from J1 which had lost a portion of either the long, short, or both arms of chromosome 11. This panel of deletion segregants was used for mapping a number of genetic markers on the short arm of chromosome 11. Karyotypic analysis led to the interpretation that derivatives of J1 selected for the loss of cell surface antigens encoded by genes on the short arm of the chromosome had simple terminal deletions of this chromosome arm. More recently, we have applied recombinant DNA and in situ hybridization techniques to the analysis of the structure of chromosome 11. In the course of this analysis, we have obtained data that indicate that all J1 deletion segregants retain a small chromosomal segment containing the structural genes for insulin and HRAS1. Analysis of in situ hybridization data indicates that in cell lines in which a chromosome 11 fragment cannot be identified by karyotype analysis, human DNA has been translocated to a Chinese Hamster chromosome. These results suggest that the original interpretation of the karyotypes of deletion segregants derived from J1 as simple terminal deletions is not correct. A reanalysis of gene localization studies based on these deletion segregants suggests that some assignments of genes to specific bands on chromosome 11 should be reconsidered. In particular, data on additional deletion segregants are consistent with localization of the beta-globin gene complex to band 11p15. The data presented here suggest that in several hybrid derivatives of J1, a continuous DNA segment of approximately 10(7) base pairs in length which includes the insulin and HRAS1 (cellular homolog of retroviral oncogene Harvey ras) genes has been isolated from the remainder of the human genome. We propose that the stability of chromosome 11 in the original hybrid was due to complementation of a genetic defect in the original CHO cell parent by a gene located in close physical proximity to the insulin and HRAS1 genes on chromosome 11. Data are presented which test and support this hypothesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>2127</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Chromosomal mechanisms in the initiation of human familial mixed cancers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>74</offset><text>A strong case for a genetic diathesis in human cancer can be made through the analysis of familial aggregations of mixed tumor types.

Here are described studies designed to apply molecular genetic analysis toward defining the lesions which predispose to human cancer. We found that the clinically associated tumors retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma share a pathogenetic mechanism entailing aberrant chromosomal segregation events during mitosis which lead to tumor cells homozygous for recessive mutant alleles at the RB1 locus on human chromosome 13 band q14.

The first infant (case 1) presented with neonatal hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, and mild hyperbilirubinemia; she rapidly deteriorated and died of multisystem failure. Autopsy showed cirrhosis. Her sister (case 2) presented similarly; liver biopsy showed giant cell hepatitis, which is consistent with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INHP). However, iron staining revealed that case 1 had extensive iron deposits in the liver, pancreas, heart, thymus, and bone, but none in bone marrow or spleen.

At 16 months of age, the growth, development, and serum measures of iron status in case 2 were normal; liver biopsy showed fibrosis, negative iron staining, and normal tissue iron concentration. NHC is compatible with survival, has clinicopathologic features that overlap with INHP, and may frequently be misdiagnosed as INHP.

On electron microscopy, the vacuoles lacked limiting membranes and were adjacent to the mitochondria. Total and free carnitines in muscle were normal levels. Production rate of 14CO2 or acid-soluble [14C]metabolites from [1-14C]palmitate in the patient's cells was decreased to about 50% of that in control cells, whereas that from [1-14C]butyrate was normal.

Although the underlying metabolic defect has not been elucidated, this disease seems to be an autosomal-recessively inherited disorder of systemic triglyceride storage, probably due to an impaired regulation of lipolysis and triacylglycerol synthesis.</text></passage></document><document><id>2136</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Hexose monophosphate shunt enzymes in lung tumors from normal and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficient subjects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>120</offset><text>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate, dehydrogenase the key enzymes of the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway, were measured in both surrounding and tumoral lung tissues from normal and G6PD-deficient subjects.

The frequency of aggravated heredity in the patients' parents was significantly higher than that in the healthy persons' parents (21.3 +/- 1.8 and 12.1 +/- 1.2%, respectively, P less than 0.05), this predominance being associated with such diseases as chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma. A study of a type of familial aggravation has shown that the probability of CB development in descendants increases substantially if mother suffers from CB, CB morbidity among girls being significantly higher than that among boys. The results of a sib analysis also confirm an important role of the genetic mechanisms in CB development. Investigations using a twin method (14 pairs of monozygotic and 39 pairs of dizygotic twins) have demonstrated that genetic factors account for 41% in the formation of the leading CB symptoms while exogenous factors account for 59%. A study of the blood antigens ABO, Rh, MN, P, Hp has revealed different sensitivity of persons with different genetic blood markers to CB. Differences in the frequency of antigen combinations were also revealed in the patients and in the healthy persons. The results obtained indicate the appropriateness of further development of genetic investigations in pulmonology.</text></passage></document><document><id>2138</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Survival and causes of death in hemochromatosis.

Mean followup was 10.5 +/- 5.6 years (+/- SD). Cumulative survival was 76% at 10 years and 49% at 20 years. Life expectancy was reduced in patients who presented with cirrhosis or diabetes compared to patients who presented without these complications at the time of diagnosis. Patients who could be depleted of iron during the first 18 months of venesection therapy had a markedly better prognosis compared to those patients who could not be depleted during this time period, probably due to greater amounts of excessive iron. Prognosis was not influenced by sex. Patients without cirrhosis or diabetes had a life expectancy that was virtually identical to that of an age-matched normal population. Analysis of the causes of death in 53 patients showed that liver cancer (n = 16) was 219 times more frequent, cardiomyopathy (n = 3) was 306 times more frequent, liver cirrhosis (n = 10) was 13 times more frequent, and diabetes mellitus (n = 3) was seven times more frequent compared to death rates expected for an age-matched normal population. The risk of death from other causes, including extrahepatic cancer (n = 7), did not differ from rates expected. Thus, patients with hemochromatosis diagnosed in a precirrhotic stage and treated by venesection have a normal life expectancy. Cirrhotic patients had a shortened life expectancy and a high risk of death from liver cancer even when complete iron depletion has been achieved.</text></passage></document><document><id>2139</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Studies on the mechanism of zinc uptake by human fibroblasts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>62</offset><text>The mechanisms of zinc uptake from a complete culture medium by human fibroblasts have been studied. The metal is accumulated in a biphasic pattern; an initial rapid phase followed by a slower linear phase. We suggest that the former represents binding to carriers or receptors on the cell surface followed by uptake to within the cell, or at least to a compartment inaccessible to proteolytic digestion. The uptake correlates well with estimates of the zinc requirement of a growing fibroblast. The process of uptake is saturable, with an apparent association constant of 1.1 X 10(7) M-1. Interestingly, there appears to be a very large number of binding sites, 2 X 10(7) per cell. No explanation for this observation is immediately apparent. The mechanism of uptake is not dependent on metabolic energy, or at least on ATP levels within the cell, but N-ethyl maleimide does block uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Weak bases and ionophores, apart from nigericin, do not affect uptake. The results suggest that zinc is not taken up by a receptor-mediated endocytic pathway as has been described for transferrin and iron.</text></passage></document><document><id>2140</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A screening test for detecting iron overload in population studies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><text>A simple, robust, inexpensive and reasonably accurate screening test, which involves colorimetric assessment of the unsaturated iron-binding capacity, was used to detect significant degrees of iron overload in a field setting. It was used in a survey of 152 men aged over 40 years who had previously been identified as having serum ferritin values above 400 micrograms/l and who were therefore potentially homozygous carriers of the HLA-linked iron-loading gene responsible for the clinical disorder idiopathic haemochromatosis (IHC). Such individuals almost always have a raised transferrin saturation and the screening test was compared with a standard method of measurement. The screening test accurately identified 7 out of 10 subjects with transferrin saturations above 62%. It also accurately identified 137 out of 142 subjects with saturation below 62%. There were 5 false-positive results; in all these subjects saturations were at the upper limit of normal or marginally raised. The test thus had a sensitivity of 77%, a specificity of 97%, an accuracy of 95% and a positive predictive accuracy of 67%. The test successfully identified a subgroup of subjects with serum ferritin values above 400 micrograms/l who appeared to have more severe degrees of iron overload. The screening test, which requires only 200 microliter serum and costs only 6.2 c, should not only be of potential value in identifying subjects at risk of developing the clinical manifestations of IHC but may prove even more useful in defining the prevalence of significant iron overload in the rural black population of South Africa.</text></passage></document><document><id>2141</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Freeze-fracture studies of myofiber plasma membrane in X chromosome-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>106</offset><text>The structure of the muscle plasma membrane of extensor digitorum longus muscles of X chromosome-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mice was studied by freeze-fracture technique at several time points after birth.

The only known kindred with XS2 segregating was examined for polymorphic DNA markers with known regional localisations on the X chromosome. Two point linkage analysis suggested linkage of XS to DXS14 (p58.1) with theta = 0.00, z = 1.96. DXS14 is situated near the centromere at Xp11. Recombinants with DXS84 (distal to DXS14 on Xp) and recombinants with DXYS1 (pDP34) (on the proximal part of Xq) suggests a localisation for XS near the centromere, between DXS84 and DXYS1 (Xp21.2-Xq21.1).

This antibody precipitates the two chains of C5 from normal mouse serum and inhibits C5-dependent hemolysis in a functional complement test. In this study we describe its application in an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA assay) for the detection of anti-C5 antibodies in serum. Monoclonal anti-C5 coupled to wells of an ELISA plate specifically binds C5 from unfractionated normal mouse serum. This subsequently serves as antigen to bind anti-C5 serum antibodies. By this approach we have circumvented the need for extensive purification of C5 from serum which would be required if C5 was directly coupled to ELISA plates as antigen. Serum antibodies from C5-immunized mice bound with high avidity to wells containing normal serum as antigen source in amounts representing 1 microgram to 250 ng C5. There was no antibody binding to wells containing C5-deficient serum as antigen source. The immune reaction was detected by development with enzyme-coupled goat-anti mouse Ig antibodies specific for various mouse Ig subclasses. This method allows the qualitative characterization of immune responses to mouse C5 which is an ideal model for a natural self antigen in studies of immunological tolerance.</text></passage></document><document><id>2148</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Complete reactivation of X chromosomes from human chorionic villi with a switch to early DNA replication.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>106</offset><text>Mammalian sex-dosage compensation is mediated by maintaining activity of only one X chromosome. The asynchronous DNA synthesis characterizing the silent human X chromosome is thought to be reversible only during ontogeny of oocytes. We have previously shown that the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) locus (G6PD) on the allocyclic X chromosome in chorionic villi is partially expressed. We now show that in hybrids derived from a clone of chorionic villi cells (heterozygous for G6PD A) and mouse A9 cells, the loci for G6PD, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and phosphoglycerate kinase are expressed on both human X chromosomes; the human X chromosomes carrying either G6PD A or B replicate synchronously with each other and with murine chromosomes. The X chromosome with G6PD A was identified as the original late-replicating X, because methylation in the body of the HPRT gene on this chromosome remained characteristic of the inactive X chromosome. These results indicate that X-chromosome inactivation is completely reversible in cells of trophoblast origin; induction of full transcriptional activity is accompanied by acquisition of isocyclic replication, showing an intimate relationship between these processes. The molecular events responsible for this reversal may be similar to those occurring during maturation of oocytes. Chorionic villi and derivative hybrids provide in vitro models for exploring early events that program the single active X chromosome.</text></passage></document><document><id>2149</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mapping the locus for hereditary hemochromatosis: localization between HLA-B and HLA-A.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>We studied a family with HLA-linked hereditary hemochromatosis in which an informative recombination occurred within the HLA region. The father, an obligate heterozygote for hereditary hemochromatosis, had HLA haplotypes A2,B13 and A11,B27. The mother, also an obligate heterozygote, had HLA haplotypes A29,B44 and A2,B7. Three haplotypes were found among three homozygous affected offspring. Two affected siblings were HLA-identical with haplotypes A2,B13 and A29,B44. The proband had HLA haplotypes A2,B13 and A2,B44, the latter a recombinant haplotype inherited from her mother. Since the maternal hemochromatosis allele was linked to the A29,B44 haplotype, and since the proband has hemochromatosis, the maternal hemochromatosis allele was transmitted to the proband with the B44 antigen. This is the first known example of recombination in an individual with HLA-linked hemochromatosis in whom the hemochromatosis allele appeared to segregate with the HLA-B antigen instead of the -A antigen. The possibility of either a double reciprocal recombination event or a gene conversion event cannot be excluded. Combined with earlier observations of segregation of the hemochromatosis allele with the A locus in HLA recombinants, the findings in this pedigree map the hemochromatosis locus between the HLA-B and HLA-A loci rather than outside the HLA region.</text></passage></document><document><id>2150</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding rat and human medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and assignment of the gene to human chromosome 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>136</offset><text>Rat liver mRNA encoding the precursor of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was purified to near homogeneity by polysome immunoadsorption using a polyclonal, monospecific antibody. A single-stranded, 32P-labeled cDNA probe was synthesized using the enriched mRNA as template and was used to screen directly 15,000 colonies from a total rat liver cDNA library constructed in pBR322. One clone [600 base pairs (bp)] was positively identified by hybrid-selected translation combined with mitochondrial processing of translated products. Using the isolated rat cDNA as probe, 43,000 colonies from a human liver cDNA library were screened. Three overlapping clones (1100 bp, 500 bp, and 400 bp) were isolated and positively identified by hybrid-selected translation. The largest human cDNA clone was subcloned into the transcription vector pGEM-2, which contains a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. In vitro transcription of this recombinant, followed by in vitro translation, showed that the cDNA clone coded for approximately 80% of the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein. The sizes of rat and human mRNAs encoding the precursor of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase were 2.2 and 2.4 kilobases long, respectively, as determined by blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated poly(A)+ RNA. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids with an isolated human cDNA assigned the gene coding for this enzyme to the short arm of chromosome 1, band p31. The chromosomal assignment was confirmed by in situ hybridization of the probe to human metaphase cells. Direct screening of cDNA libraries using a highly enriched mRNA to generate a probe, as demonstrated in this study, may provide the most rapid and convenient approach to cDNA cloning of low-abundance mRNAs.</text></passage></document><document><id>2151</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Machado-Joseph disease: linkage analysis between the loci for the disease and 18 protein markers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset></passage></document><document><id>2152</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Sixteen clones were completely karyotyped with the G-banding technique. The unique markers 1p-q+, 16p- found in all clones, as well as in the parallel uncloned line, U-343 MG, provided evidence of their common origin. The deduced early, possibly partly primary, deviations had the formula 44, XY, 1p-q+, -14, 16p-, -22, where loss of one chromosome 22 is in accordance with previous reports on early chromosomal deviations in gliomas. Two clones, the hypodiploid 26L and 5H, represented early progressional changes. The other clones followed two patterns of late progressional changes, probably starting from the karyotype of 5H, with additional markers and doubling of the stemlines. In late progressional line I 12q+ and in II +7 were the most characteristic findings. Northern blot analysis using complementary DNA clones for the A and B chains of PDGF showed that both PDGF chains were expressed in 26L and 5H indicating that activation of the PDGF genes could have been an early event in the development of this glioma. Clones with late progression pattern II had been subjected to the highest selective pressure in vitro, and they secreted the highest amount of PDGF-like activity to the extracellular medium. Among them were the most rapidly and tightly growing cells and some clones with high 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor binding. Possibly these findings reflect progressional changes including defective regulation of the growth factor/growth factor receptor genes, selected for in vitro, without involving gross rearrangements or amplifications of the genes. The possible significance of extra chromosomes 7, with the PDGF A chain and epidermal growth factor receptor genes, and of the 12q+ marker, located near the gamma interferon gene is discussed.</text></passage></document><document><id>2160</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetics of ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and Reiter's syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>79</offset></passage></document><document><id>2161</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The capillary thrombometer and von Willebrand factor.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>54</offset><text>A modified capillary thrombometer was constructed to study the rate of thrombus formation using heparinized whole blood (2 U/ml) from 4 different groups of pigs: normal, heterozygous von Willebrand's disease (vWD), homozygous vWD, and platelet storage pool disease (SPD).

These assays also revealed a propensity of patient serum to form an activated complex of the fifth and sixth components of C, C56. Each of the C component hemolytic activities was present in normal or elevated amounts with the exception of C7, which was undetectable; addition of purified C7 led to the restoration of hemolytic activity. C-dependent phagocytosis, immune adherence, and neutrophil chemotaxis were normal. Family studies demonstrated that the defect was transmitted as an autosomal codominant apparently not linked with alleles at the HLA-A or HLA-B loci. Persisting C56 was readily formed in this as compared to normal serum upon incubation with multiple C activators including zymosan, inulin, immune complexes, heat-aggregated human gamma globulin, endotoxin, and agarose. A heat-stable (56 degrees C, 30 min) activity which consumed C7 with time-and temperature-dependent kinetics was detected in plasma and serum, and seemed to be similar to a "C7 inactivator" previously described in another C7-deficient individual. However, this activity was found to have properties identical to those of C56 during low ionic strength precipitation and chromatography on Sephadex G-200, to be specifically removed upon passage through an anti-C5 immunoadsorbent column, and to be associated with a small amount of C56, suggesting that it represents an expression of small amounts of C56 rather than a new C-inhibitory activity. Thus, an individual with chronic nephritis lacking C7 is reported; the utility of a hemolytic screen assay in agarose plates for the detection of such patients is emphasized; persisting C56 is shown readily to be formed in this serum; and the presence of C7-consuming activity which is associated with and in all likelihood attributable to C56 is shown.</text></passage></document><document><id>2163</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The morbid anatomy of the human genome: a review of gene mapping in clinical medicine (1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>91</offset></passage></document><document><id>2164</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An inherited deficiency of the third component of complement, C3, in guinea pigs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>82</offset><text>Hereditary deficiency of the third component of complement, C3, is found very seldom in the human. C3 deficiency is associated with severe bacterial infections revealing the central role of C3 in complement activation via the classical or alternative pathway. We describe a new hereditary C3 deficiency in strain 2 guinea pigs. Serum from these animals had a markedly reduced lytic activity in a standard assay for complement-dependent, antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. In functional assays of individual components, the hemolytic activity of the components C4, C2, C5 and of factors B, D and H was in the normal range. The functional C3 titer, and similarly C3 antigenic activity in the serum of these C3-deficient animals (C3D) was on average only 5.7% of normal activity. Typing the animals with alloantisera or monoclonal antibodies to guinea pig Ia-antigens revealed that the C3D animals had the major histocompatibility complex-haplotype of inbred strain 2 guinea pigs (B.1, Ia.2,4). The C3 defect is not linked to the major histocompatibility complex and, in addition, is not linked to a C3a receptor deficiency. Macrophages and hepatocytes of the C3D animals have an unimpaired capacity for synthesis and secretion of C3 as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was no indication for hypercatabolism of normal C3 by the animals as shown by plasma clearance of 125I-radiolabeled C3. Thrombocytes of the C3D animals responded normally to stimulation with purified C3a in an ATP-release assay without an indication for a desensitization in vivo. Possibly the fault resides in an enhanced susceptibility of their own C3 to proteolysis. However, C3 partially purified from the plasma of the C3D animals or secreted by hepatocytes exhibited no obvious structural differences to purified normal C3 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or in immunoblotting. The C3D serum had a reduced bactericidal activity compared to normal or to C4-deficient serum. Nevertheless, the animals are apparently healthy without an indication for increased frequency of bacterial infections. These guinea pigs provide an unique model for analysis of the biological functions of C3 in vivo and in vitro without the need for artificial C3-depletion procedures with all their known and unknown side-effects.</text></passage></document><document><id>2165</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Bone marrow transplantation in Lesch-Nyhan disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>52</offset></passage></document><document><id>2166</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The generalized atrophic benign form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa.

Prior to the performance of definitive diagnostic studies, each patient had been thought for at least a decade to have either a dystrophic or simplex form of epidermolysis bullosa. Each patient had generalized blisters since birth that healed with atrophy and mild scarring but without milia or contractures. Two of the four patients had experienced laryngeal involvement during childhood. In each patient, correct diagnosis was finally established by either electron microscopic examination or immunofluorescence mapping of skin sections from induced blisters.</text></passage></document><document><id>2167</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Bilateral Coats' disease in an infant (a clinical, angiographic, light and electron microscopic study).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>104</offset><text>The clinical, angiographic, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features of a bilateral and asymmetrical case of Coats' disease in a three year old girl are described.

Examples of genetic models are dogs and pigs with von Willebrand's disease. The homozygous von Willebrand pig appears to be resistant to arteriosclerosis, presumably due to impairment of the platelet aggregating function. Among acquired models, pigs are gaining in favor, perhaps because their clotting and platelet characteristics resemble those in humans. Species vary markedly in their normal plasma levels of platelet aggregating factor/von Willebrand factor (PAF/vWF). One promising approach to the study of thrombosis is using platelet anti-aggregating drugs to inhibit PAF/vWF dependent platelet thrombus formation; a drug-induced von Willebrand state seems feasible.</text></passage></document><document><id>2169</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic analysis of human breast cancer: a synthesis of contributions to GAW IV.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>81</offset></passage></document><document><id>2170</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Anaesthesia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Extrahepatic tissues lack the enzymes required for the degradation of sterols to the excretable form of bile acids. Cholesterol synthesized in these tissues in excess of that needed for the synthesis of cell membranes or steroid hormones must accordingly be returned through the plasma to the liver for catabolism. The series of reactions involved has been termed reverse cholesterol transport. Catalysed steps of this pathway are believed to include an efflux from peripheral cells, which generates a diffusion gradient between these membranes and extracellular fluid; esterification of this cholesterol by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase) acting on species of high-density lipoproteins; transfer of the cholesteryl esters formed (largely to low- and very low-density lipoproteins) (LDL and VLDL) by a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP); and removal of these lipoproteins, together with their cholesteryl ester content, by the liver through receptor-mediated and nonspecific endocytosis. Of these steps, the CETP reaction is the least characterized. Several laboratories have reported the purification from human plasma of proteins active on cholesteryl ester transfer between lipoprotein particles and possibly between cells and plasma. However, the reported relative molecular mass (Mr), abundance and specificity of the purified activities have differed considerably. We have recently described the preparation of a highly active CETP of Mr 74,000 purified about 100,000-fold from human plasma, which may represent the functional component of earlier preparations. Using a partial amino-acid sequence from this purified protein, CETP complementary DNA derived from human liver DNA has been cloned and sequenced and the cloned DNA used to detect CETP messenger RNA in a number of human tissues.</text></passage></document><document><id>2175</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Effect of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase on distribution of apolipoprotein A-IV among lipoproteins of human plasma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>122</offset><text>The effect of cholesterol esterification on the distribution of apoA-IV in human plasma was investigated. Human plasma was incubated in the presence or absence of the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) inhibitor 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and immediately fractionated by 6% agarose column chromatography. Fractions were monitored for apoA-IV, apoE, and apoA-I by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Incubation resulted in an elevated plasma concentration of cholesteryl ester and in an altered distribution of apoA-IV. After incubation apoA-IV eluted in the ordinarily apoA-IV-poor fractions of plasma that contain small VLDL particles, LDL, and HDL2. Inclusion of DTNB during the incubation resulted in some enlargement of HDL; however, both cholesterol esterification and lipoprotein binding of apoA-IV were inhibited. Addition of DTNB to plasma after incubation and prior to gel filtration had no effect on the apoA-IV distribution when the lipoproteins were immediately fractionated. Fasting plasma apoE was distributed in two or three peaks; in some plasmas there was a small peak that eluted with the column void volume, and, in all plasmas, there were larger peaks that eluted with the VLDL-LDL region and HDL2. Incubation resulted in displacement of HDL apoE to larger lipoproteins and this effect was observed in the presence or absence of DTNB. ApoA-I was distributed in a single broad peak that eluted in the region of HDL and the gel-filtered distribution was unaffected by incubation either in the presence or absence of DTNB. Incubation of plasma that was previously heated to 56 degrees C to inactivate LCAT resulted in no additional movement of apoA-IV onto lipoproteins, unless purified LCAT was present during incubation. The addition of heat-inactivated LCAT to the incubation, had no effect on movement of apoA-IV. These data suggest that human apoA-IV redistribution from the lipoprotein-free fraction to lipoprotein particles appears to be dependent on LCAT action. The mechanism responsible for the increased binding of apoA-IV to the surface of lipoproteins when LCAT acts may involve the generation of "gaps" in the lipoprotein surface due to the consumption of substrate from the surface and additional enlargement of the core. ApoA-IV may bind to these "gaps," where the packing density of the phospholipid head groups is reduced.</text></passage></document><document><id>2176</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Specific inhibitor of complement (C5)-derived chemotactic activity in systemic lupus erythematosus related antigenically to the Bb fragment of human factor B.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>159</offset><text>Serum and plasma from patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus contain a specific inhibitor of complement (C5)-derived chemotactic activity. We found that the inhibitor is antigenically related to the Bb fragment of complement factor B. Lupus plasma and purified inhibitor significantly reduced the chemotactic activity of zymosan-treated normal serum, an effect that was abolished by antibodies to factor B. Similar results were obtained when purified Bb was used. Neither purified inhibitor nor Bb inhibited the chemotactic activity of purified human C5a or C5a des Arg. As reported previously, the chemotactic activity of C5a des Arg was enhanced significantly by the addition of an anionic polypeptide (cochemotaxin) present in normal serum and plasma. Interestingly, both purified lupus inhibitor and Bb inhibited the chemotactic activity exhibited by mixtures of C5a des Arg and its cochemotaxin. This effect was due, most likely, to their ability to neutralize the enhancing effect of the cochemotaxin on the chemotactic activity of C5a des Arg. Immunoelectrophoresis and western blots revealed that the purified inhibitor reacted with anti-factor B and exhibited a similar charge and molecular weight as purified Bb.</text></passage></document><document><id>2177</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic epidemiology of myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset><text>Prevalence rate of myotonic dystrophy (DM) was estimated in a large sample of the Italian population.

Onset is in childhood with slow progression of weakness. The disease is often associated with cardiac involvement, mainly with bradyarrhythmias which might be responsible for sudden death. The most striking finding derived from the literature is the high incidence of sudden death; in the 7 large families described, out of the 79 reported patients 32 died suddenly at a young age (between 25 and 56 years). We performed a cardiologic evaluation of 11 subjects of a large italian family with affected males in four generations: 5 affected males (3 adults and 2 boys), 3 carriers and 3 healthy relatives (2 females and 1 male). Supraventricular arrhythmias were documented either in the dystrophic males or in the carriers. There was no correlation between the severity of cardiac rhythm abnormality and the severity of muscular weakness in the affected males, 3 of whom required pacemaker insertion. All the carriers were free of muscular involvement, but showed arrhythmias of variable degree, in one case requiring pacemaker insertion. In conclusion our data indicate an extremely high incidence of bradyarrhythmias, sometimes serious, in patients with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Holter monitoring is therefore mandatory and electrophysiological study is sometime necessary. Because of the high risk of sudden death in adult patients, we recommend permanent pacemaker implantation even in asymptomatic subjects, as soon as bradyarrhythmias are detected.</text></passage></document><document><id>2180</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Deficiency of the sixth component of complement and susceptibility to Neisseria meningitidis infections: studies in 10 families and five isolated cases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>153</offset><text>Complement component C6 deficiency (C6D) was diagnosed in 15 patients who presented, independently, with recurrent meningococcal infection.

Segregation analysis showed that C6D occurred more frequently among the siblings of affected individuals than would be expected for co-dominant inheritance. The possible reasons for this are discussed. We also observed that the 12 non-proband C6D siblings included only four with a history suggestive of meningococcal infection, and thus C6D individuals apparently differ in susceptibility to Neisseria meningitidis infection. We confirmed previous observations that primary infection occurs later in C6D individuals than amongst susceptible complement-sufficient individuals. Among 123 patients presenting with primary meningitis, one case of C6D was diagnosed.

Regional mapping of the genes by in situ hybridization to human chromosomes indicated that the lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) resides in the p22 region of chromosome 8, while hepatic lipase gene (HL) resides in the q21 region of chromosome 15. We previously reported, on the basis of nucleotide and amino acid homologies, that these genes are members of a gene family of lipases, and, thus, the present findings indicate that the members of this family are dispersed. The results are also of significance with respect to disorders involving deficiencies of the enzymes.

We have developed several new tools for the study of hereditary enzymopathies and we report here their use in the study of genetic defects in lysosomal acid lipase. Lymphoid cell lines established by Epstein-Barr Virus transformation represent a new experimental model system in culture. The validity of such cell lines is demonstrated from the triple point of view of enzymology, metabolism and morphology (microscopic studies). Those lines are characterized by the deficiency in acid lipase whereas other lipases and carboxylesterases are not deficient. The study of lipid composition demonstrated the accumulation of neutral lipids (cholesterylesters and triglycerides). The use of fluorescent lipids for enzymatic studies and for diagnosing acid lipase deficiencies is reported and the reliability of these new substrates is demonstrated by comparison with currently used natural or synthetic substrates. For the enzymatic assays, these fluorescent substrates showed similar advantages as the radioactively labelled substrates, but not their disadvantages: thus, they can be easily used in the clinical laboratories. A new area in the field of research on lysosomal genetic diseases, is the experimental study of the metabolism in the intact living cell. The lipoproteins route is the best way to the lysosomal compartment and fluorescent lipids incorporated into lipoproteins allow to examine the lysosomal metabolism of these lipids simultaneously, by microscopic and biochemical techniques.</text></passage></document><document><id>2198</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Adenomatoid leiomyoma and papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset></passage></document><document><id>2199</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Normal mRNA content in a phosphoglycerate kinase variant with severe enzyme deficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>88</offset><text>A phosphoglycerate kinase variant, PGK-Matsue, was associated with a severe enzyme deficiency, congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, and mental disorders. The variant enzyme exhibited a slower cathodal electrophoretic mobility and lower affinity toward the substrates. The enzyme activity in the variant's red cells, muscles, and fibroblasts was about 5% of that of normal cells. The content of mRNA in the variant fibroblasts was compared to that of normal cells by the semiquantitative dot hybridization method, and, more accurately, by the liquid hybridization method, using a human PGK cDNA as a probe. It was found that the mRNA level in the variant fibroblasts was comparable to that of normal fibroblasts. The results strongly suggest that the major cause of enzyme deficiency in PGK-Matsue is a seven- to 10-fold increase in the mutant enzyme degradation.</text></passage></document><document><id>2200</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial myasthenia gravis: a study of three families.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>55</offset><text>Six patients suffering from familial myasthenia gravis belonging to three different families are described.

Heterodimers were present in clonal populations of cells with normal diploid karyotype and a late replicating X chromosome. The expression of the two X chromosomes was unequal, based on ratios of homodimers and heterodimers in clones. Studies of DNA, digested with Hpa II and probed with cloned genomic G6PD sequences, indicate that expression of the locus in chorionic villi is associated with hypomethylation of 3' CpG clusters. These findings suggest that dosage compensation, at least at the G6PD locus, has not been well established or maintained (or both) in placental tissue. Furthermore, the active X chromosome in these human cells of trophoblastic origin can be either the paternal or maternal one; therefore, paternal X inactivation in extraembryonic lineages is not an essential feature of mammalian X dosage compensation.</text></passage></document><document><id>2203</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Haptoglobin subtypes in Berlin, GDR.

All but 3 of the patients had confirmed ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in accordance with established criteria. The sacro-iliac joints were scored by a recently developed grading system. The prevalence of grade V sacro-iliits--extensive ankylosis--was greater in HLA B27-positive than in HLA B27-negative patients, and ankylosis of apophyseal joints, ossification of the interspinous ligament, or block vertebrae were not seen in HLA B27-negative patients. Shining corners and/or squared vertebrae were the most frequent findings of the dorsolumbar spine in patients with a disease course of less than 10 years. Mixed osteophytes were rare in patients below 40 years of age. All radiographic inflammatory changes scored in the spine-except for shining corners--were most often seen in patients with a disease history exceeding 20 years. Syndesmophytes and/or ankylosed apophyseal joints were less extensive in female than in male patients. No differences in the severity of radiographic changes in sacro-iliac joints or in frequency, severity or localization of different radiographic changes of the dorsolumbar spine were observed between HLA B27-positive patients with and those without psoriasis or acute anterior uveitis. Definite sacro-iliitis was restricted to HLA B27-positive relatives of HLA B27-positive probands and demonstrated in one-fifth of them. Shining corners and/or squared vertebrae were frequent findings in relatives with sacro-iliitis (45%), whereas apophyseal joint ankylosis, ossification of the interspinous ligament, block vertebrae and bridging syndesmophytes were not seen. Our results support the view that AS is not a defined disease entity and should be regarded as a syndrome. AS is an improper name for all patients fulfilling the Rome and/or New York criteria for definite AS, since many of them will probably never develop ankylosis of the spine or sacro-iliac joints.</text></passage></document><document><id>2209</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The genetics of acute anterior uveitis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>40</offset><text>Acute anterior uveitis (AAU), and the many diseases with which it is associated, may be inherited.

Mortality is high, especially amongst those babies born prematurely, but muscle strength and tone improve rapidly in survivors. Nevertheless, most survivors have physical deformities and mental retardation and are thought to develop myotonic dystrophy later. We propose that alterations in maternal insulin secretion (usual in myotonic dystrophy subjects) alter fetal blood glucose and amino acid levels and retard growth and maturation of fetal skeletal muscle. This leads to severe muscular hypotonia in affected infants. Also, we suggest that infants who die during the perinatal period may not have inherited the defective autosomal dominant gene that causes myotonic dystrophy.</text></passage></document><document><id>2211</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Rapid differential diagnosis of carboxylase deficiencies and evaluation for biotin-responsiveness in a single blood sample.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>124</offset><text>We have developed a method for rapid differential diagnosis of isolated or multiple deficiencies of the 3 mitochondrial biotin-dependent carboxylases: propionyl-CoA (PCC), 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MCC) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC), and for simultaneous evaluation of biotin-responsiveness using a single blood sample.

The noninvasive evaluation included the Rose questionnaire for angina, a resting electrocardiogram, and a graded treadmill exercise test. The presence of manifestations of CHD was assessed by a combination of these findings. Multiple linear regression and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between CHD and DLP, with adjustments for the following covariates: age, body mass, systolic blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and cigarette use. There were no consistent associations in women or in men 30 to 49 years old. In men 50 to 69 years old, the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) values and HDL-C/cholesterol ratio were significantly lower in the definite CHD and angina categories, compared with the negative (no evidence of CHD) group. Higher odds ratios for CHD were present in those classified as having type IIa, type IV, and hypoHDL DLPs, relative to those classified as normal by the phenotyping algorithm. These associations were consistent across the several categories of CHD manifestations, but did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for multiple testing. A statistically significant lower odds ratio for CHD was observed in men 50 to 69 classified as having hyperHDL when compared with those without DLPs. The associations between CHD and the various forms of DLP were consistent with those observed between CHD and the plasma lipid and lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations. The Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study confirmed the relationship between elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased HDL-C, and noninvasively determined CHD in a free-living asymptomatic population of older men.</text></passage></document><document><id>2215</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Consistent chromosomal translocation in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>67</offset></passage></document><document><id>2216</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase polymorphism in the Saudi population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>72</offset><text>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) exhibits extensive heterogeneity in the Saudi population.

These radiographic grading systems were used in a study comprising 48 patients with psoriasis (group A), 19 patients with AS and psoriasis (group B), 103 patients with AS (group C) and 231 first-degree relatives of the patients belonging to groups B and C (group D). Radiographic abnormalities of the spine were found totally in 80 per cent of the patients belonging to groups B and C. In these groups sclerotic anterior borders of vertebrae (SABS) and/or straightened anterior surfaces of vertebrae were seen totally in 66 per cent. SABS were earlier findings than syndesmophyte formation which was found in 60 per cent of the patients belonging to groups B and C. Except for ankylosis of the apophyseal joints and ossified interspinous ligament most frequently found in the lower lumbar region in patients with duration of disease more than 20 years, all abnormalities of the spine were most frequent in the dorsolumbar junction. Grade V sacro-iliitis was associated with ankylosis of two or more segments of the spine. Such spinal changes were infrequently seen in patients with grade IV sacro-iliitis. This finding supports the previous notion that among patients fulfilling the criteria for AS, there is a group with a non-ankylosing disease. Thus two different subgroups of AS could be identified. Except for frequent unilateral sacro-iliitis and slight changes of the spine in group A no radiographic differences were found between the groups A, B and C. Sacro-iliitis was found in 22 (9%) in group D, and 11 of those with sacro-iliitis had abnormalities of the spine compatible with AS.</text></passage></document><document><id>2219</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The molecular structure of different polymorphic forms of canine C3 and C4.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>76</offset><text>The subunit composition of different electrophoretic forms of canine C3 and C4 was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of reduced immune precipitates.

The findings are compared with those of two previous surveys covering the periods 1960-1965 (746 cases) and 1966-1971 (911 cases). The incidence during the 17-year period ranged between 15 and 19/100,000 women over the age of 15. The disease was three to five times more prevalent in women of European/American origin than in those of Asian/African descent. Seventy-five percent of the patients were between the ages of 45 and 74. The majority (50-71%) were already in stage III or stage IV at diagnosis. Factors affecting the prognosis are the age of the patient and clinical stage of the malignancy when first diagnosed, histology of the tumor, and type of treatment. Although the time interval between onset of the disease and its detection has remained protracted, the 5-year survival rate was improved from 15% during the period 1960-1965 to 31% between the years 1972-1976.

During the follow-up period, there was an increase in number or size of polyps, or both, in 5 patients (aged 8-27 yr), a decrease or disappearance in 2 patients (aged 36 and 41 yr), an initial decrease or disappearance followed by a late-occurring increase in 2 patients (aged 28 and 35 yr), In addition, malignant or adenomatous changes of fundic gland polyps were not observed in any patient. Therefore, fundic gland polyposis in patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome may appear as early as 8 yr of age.

A numerical score based on the number and extent of abnormal findings was developed for grading clinical and histological severity. Multiple linear regression, utilizing a forward stepwise selection procedure, was used to find the best combination of laboratory tests for prediction of disease severity. The best predictive model for both clinical and histological severity was found for lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), total plasma cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase and bile acids. Of the routine tests prothrombin time and albumin/globulin were useful if the four-test combination listed above was not used. There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between the clinical and the histological score, confirming validity of clinical scoring. In conclusion, this study shows LCAT to rank as first in predicting severity of liver disease. Cholesterol metabolism appears to be affected by liver disease even more than prothrombin time, albumin and globulins. LCAT and bile acids have a place in routine testing of severity of liver disease.</text></passage></document><document><id>2229</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Fatty aldehyde dehydrogenases in Acinetobacter sp. strain HO1-N: role in hexadecanol metabolism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>97</offset><text>The role of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenases (FALDHs) in hexadecane and hexadecanol metabolism was studied in Acinetobacter sp. strain HO1-N.

The NADP-dependent FALDH exhibited apparent Km and Vmax values for decyl aldehyde of 5.0, 13.0, 18.0, and 18.3 microM and 537.0, 500.0, 25.0, and 38.0 nmol/min in hexadecane-, hexadecanol-, ethanol-, palmitate-grown cells, respectively.

Dodecyl aldehyde-negative mutants were isolated and grouped into two phenotypic classes based on growth: class 1 mutants were hexadecane and hexadecanol negative and class 2 mutants were hexadecane and hexadecanol positive. Specific activity of NADP-dependent FALDH in Ald21 (class 1 mutant) was 85% lower than that of wild-type FALDH, while the specific activity of Ald24 (class 2 mutant) was 55% greater than that of wild-type FALDH. Ald21R, a dodecyl aldehyde-positive revertant able to grow on hexadecane, hexadecanol, and dodecyl aldehyde, exhibited a 100% increase in the specific activity of the NADP-dependent FALDH. The oxidation of [3H]hexadecane byAld21 yielded the accumulation of 61% more fatty aldehyde than the wild type, while Ald24 accumulated 27% more fatty aldehyde, 95% more fatty alcohol, and 65% more wax ester than the wild type. This study provides genetic and physiological evidence for the role of fatty aldehyde as an essential metabolic intermediate and NADP-dependent FALDH as a key enzyme in the dissimilation of hexadecane, hexadecanol, and dodecyl aldehyde in Acinetobactor sp. strain HO1-N.</text></passage></document><document><id>2230</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[The TAR syndrome in 3 unrelated children].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>44</offset></passage></document><document><id>2231</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The clinical significance of platelet volume analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>55</offset></passage></document><document><id>2232</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Familial cranial diabetes insipidus: a report of five families.

In the pedigrees presented, the disease clearly followed an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Linkage analysis was performed in one large family by calculating lod scores for linkage between loci for cranial diabetes insipidus and 18 polymorphic markers and chromosome heteromorphisms. No significant genetic linkage was found and only one of the polymorphic markers gave a positive hint of linkage. A water deprivation test was performed in nine patients from three of the families and in healthy control subjects. The plasma concentration of arginine vasopressin was very low or undetectable in the patients, and unlike the control subjects did not increase significantly during water deprivation. Arginine vasopressin and serum osmolality (Sosm) were significantly positively correlated in the controls, but not in the patients. The results indicated that an arginine vasopressin-level lower than 2 pg/ml strongly suggests a diagnosis of cranial diabetes insipidus if at the same time Sosm is higher than 295 mosmol/kg. Studies with different intranasal dosages of 1-deamino-D-arginine-vasopressin (DDAVP) given once or twice a day showed that 20 micrograms effectively reduced urinary output and that administration once a day could be sufficient.</text></passage></document><document><id>2233</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Neutral and acid lipase of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts with increased adipose conversion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>84</offset><text>In the resting state, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts become adipose converted and increase their fatty acid and triglyceride synthetase.

A highly purified inactivator of the third component of complement (C3) from human serum inhibited the proteolysis of Factor B in the properdin system (glycine-rich beta-glycoprotein) by glycine-rich beta-glycoproteinase. The inhibition was by the enzymatic destruction of glycine-rich beta-glycoproteinase activity. The major fragment of C3, C3b, which is the only known substrate of the C3 inactivator, blocked the destruction of glycine-rich beta-glycoproteinase by the C3 inactivator. Thus, in its inhibition of the porperdin pathway, the C3 inactivator destroys both the active form of glycine-rich beta-glycoproteinase and a protein involved in the conversion of the zymogen form of this enzyme (proglycine-rich beta-glycoproteinase) to its active form. The increased susceptibility to infections in a patient homozygous for deficiency of the C3 inactivator demonstrates the biologic significance of this protein.</text></passage></document><document><id>2247</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Drugs and genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>17</offset></passage></document><document><id>2248</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Progressive decline in potentials recorded in the ERG in a case of tapeto-retinal degeneration].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>98</offset></passage></document><document><id>2249</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Colchicine therapy for familial mediterranean fever.

Conversion of immunologic reactivity correlated with clinical benefit. Thirteen of the patients who received transfer factor are alive, and 17 have died (43 per cent survival). Clinical benefit was correlated with survival. The median survival was greater than five years in the patients who showed clinical benefit, whereas it was 18 months in those who did not show clinical benefit. We conclude that transfer factor caused conversion of immunologic parameters, apparent clinical benefit and prolonged survival in some, but not all, patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.</text></passage></document><document><id>2254</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Type 3 mixed xanthomatosis].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>30</offset></passage></document><document><id>2255</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The dermatopathology of Cowden's syndrome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>43</offset><text>During the past 2 years we have studied eighty-nine biopsy specimens from nineteen patients with Cowden's syndrome.

All fourteen oral mucosal biopsy specimens were benign fibromas. Nineteen of twenty-two biopsy specimens from the hands and feet showed the pattern of benign keratosis. Multiple trichilemmomas were found in all patients with Cowden's syndrome, but at times several biopsy specimens were required before a diagnostic picture was uncovered. All patients with multiple facial trichilemmomas were found to have Cowden's syndrome.

This proportion is significantly more than the 9.4% observed or the 22.2% expected in Jamaican neonates who are not moderately or severely jaundiced (P less than 0.003), and significantly more than the 12.6% observed or the 21.0% expected in older Jamaican children and adults (P less than 0.003). Phenobarbitone therapy and phototherapy reduced the need for exchange transfusion but this was necessary in eight patients. Two babies developed kernicterus and one died. On the other hand, only two of 21 neonates who were identified as G6PD deficient at birth subsequently became moderately or severely jaundiced, and this could be attributed to other causes in both cases. These findings indicate that apparently spontaneous neonatal jaundice is important in infants who have the G6PD A--enzyme. However, the jaundice is probably precipitated by unknown factors to which the G6PD deficient neonate is more susceptible than the infant who is not G6PD deficient. THere is also a slightly increased incidence of G6PD deficiency in neonates who develop jaundice because of ABO or Rh(D) iso-immune disease, infection or prematurity.</text></passage></document><document><id>2275</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Studies on diabetes insipidus in children.

In the dominantly inherited form, one mutation is inherited via the germinal cells and the second occurs in somatic cells. In the nonhereditary form, both mutations occur in somatic cells. The second mutation produces an average of three retinoblastomas per individual inheriting the first mutation. Using Poisson statistics, one can calculate that this number (three) can explain the occasional gene carrier who gets no tumor, those who develop only unilateral tumors, and those who develop bilateral tumors, as well as explaining instances of multiple tumors in one eye. This value for the mean number of tumors occurring in genetic carriers may be used to estimate the mutation rate for each mutation. The germinal and somatic rates for the first, and the somatic rate for the second, mutation, are approximately equal. The germinal mutation may arise in some instances from a delayed mutation.</text></passage></document><document><id>2280</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>X-linked haematological traits.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>32</offset></passage></document><document><id>2281</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Von Wllebrands disease.

Applied most often to sira, a traditional ailment involving somatic and anxiety symptoms, these explanations are construed as a two-level ordered sequence of steps including elements from both ordinary reality and the demonic world. Traditional patients are usually more aware of the manifest chain of precipitating events centering around emotional consequences of a real trauma. Their rabbi-healers, however, are predisposed towards molding these events into a covert-demonic pattern, the core of which involves a human injuring a jinn and the latter's retaliation. In the explanatory scheme the real-traumatic and the demonic plots are intermingled and this fusion lends the etiological sequence a meaningful rationale as exemplified by two case illustrations. Nevertheless, our analysis renders the demonic substratum quite vulnerable, since the manifest-traumatic plot may be singled out as an autonomous explanation under the impact of the mainstream of modern Israeli society. Reasons for the hitherto tenacious preservation of the demonic component among traditional segments in Israel are presented by comparing the explanatory status of demons and psychoanalytic concepts. Certain vulnerabilities of the denomic explanation which throw doubt upon its long-term survival in modern context are discussed as well.</text></passage></document><document><id>2285</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase and galactokinase activity in cultured human diploid fibroblasts and peripheral blood leukocytes.

Growth curves were obtained for fibroblasts based on three different parameters: direct cell counts, total protein, and total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content. At the time in culture when the specific activity of both enzymes was maximal and least variable, the ratio of transferase to galactokinase correlated well with the transferase genotypes of the original tissue donors. Leukocyte transferase: galactokinase ratios gave a similar distribution pattern. Whereas transferase activity in both fibroblasts and leukocytes was similar, galactokinase was approximately three times as active in fibroblasts as in leukocytes. All fibrobast cell strains tested had similar galactokinase activity regardless of transferase genotype.The kinetic properties of fibroblast galactokinase were examined. Galactose-1-phosphate inhibits galactokinase activity in both normal and galactosemic cell strains, whereas other glycolytic intermediates have no effect. There was no detectable transferase activity in eight galactosemic (Gt(G)/Gt(G)) cell strains when transferase activity was maximal in cell strains of other transferase genotypes. Inhibitors responsible for the absence of transferase activity could not be demonstrated. In addition, transferase activity in galactosemic cell lysates was not observed in cells during logarithmic growth; measurable uridine diphosphate galactose (UDPgal) pyrophosphorylase activity was found in human diploid fibroblast cultures, as well as significant levels of endogenous uridine triphosphate (UTP) in lysates of fibroblast cultures.</text></passage></document><document><id>2286</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>New glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants observed in Israel and their association with congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>138</offset></passage></document><document><id>2287</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[A familial case of Thomsen's disease with early onset].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>57</offset></passage></document><document><id>2288</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The hereditary torsion dystonias (dystonia musculorum deformans): Geographical distribution and IQ in dominant and recessive forms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>132</offset></passage></document><document><id>2289</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Hemolytic anemia caused by glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency: 2 familial cases].</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>93</offset></passage></document><document><id>2290</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Perifollicular fibromas.

At least two types of particles are present, one large and the other small. The large particles predominate in a LDL subfraction of large molecular weight isolated by gel filtration on 2% agarose gel. They appear to be flattened structures with diameters mainly in the range of 900-1200 A. The small particles predominate in a LDL subfraction of smaller molecular weight isolated by filtration on the same type of gel. They are 210-250 A in diameter and are similar to normal LDL in size and shape. The high density lipoproteins (HDL) also are heterogeneous. The majority of particles are disc-shaped structures 150-200 A in diameter. The discs are mainly present in stacks which have a periodicity of 50-55 A and a variable length. Each disc appears to be made up of a rosette of smaller globular units 50 A in diameter. The appearance of these large molecular weight HDL contrasts with that of normal HDL, which are 70-100 A in diameter and aggregate in monolayers that show hexagonal packing of particles. A small percentage of the patients' HDL consists of structures 45-60 A in diameter. These predominate in a smaller molecular weight HDL subfraction isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G200. The particles are present in monolayer aggregates but never form stacked structures similar to those seen in the large molecular weight HDL subfraction.</text></passage></document><document><id>2299</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Comparison of clinical features in HLA-B27 positive and negative patients with ankylosing spondylitis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>103</offset><text>The clinical features of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were compared in 63 HLA-B 27 positive (+) and 15 B27 negative (-) individuals with this disease. There were no differences in age at onset, functional class, degree of deformity, pain, severity of X-ray changes, or frequency of peripheral joint involvement or of reconstructive orthopedic surgery. These data demonstrated that skeletal manifestations of AS were essentially the same in B27(+) and (-) patients, and provide no evidence for the speculation that AS in B27(-) patients is milder or is a different disease from that occurring in B27(+) patients. On the other hand, acute anterior uveitis was found to be significantly more common in B27(+) patients, a fact suggesting that the "uveitis of AS" may in fact be an independent condition occurring in B27(+) individuals, rather than a manifestation of AS per se.</text></passage></document></collection>

% Abstract
\begin{abstract}

\noindent A wide range of economic and social situations are decided by either a
race or a tournament. In such contests, agents choose whether and how
much to exert some costly effort to increase the probability of being
awarded a prize under uncertainty about the other agents types or
actions. In theory, whenever the sponsor of the competition prefers
competitors' performance over the time to complete a particular task,
the expected outcomes of a tournament setup should be either equal or
greater than those of a race. Yet, a race might be more efficient from
an economic point of view as it may prevent unnecessary costs due to an
excess of participation. We examine this trade-off empirically. We
report the results of a field experiment conducted on a leading
crowdsourcing platform where we compare the outcomes (efforts, quality,
and diversity of outputs) of three alternative competitive situations
motivated by theory: the race, the tournament, and the tournament with a
quality requirement.

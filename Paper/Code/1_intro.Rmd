Introduction
============

Organizations use often prizes as incentive schemes for innovation. Inside firms, contests are useful tools for exploiting and expanding the internal innovative capacity of the company. Contests are also sponsored by various institutions as a means to source innovative ideas from outside the boundaries of the organization, including the members of large online communities of practitioners.^[In the United States, for instance, the government routinely sponsors open calls for innovation tackling important issues of public policy (public health, education, environment protection).] And a growing number of platforms like Challenge.gov, Innocentive, Topcoder, and XPRIZE, have become available to help organize and connect these institutions with potential participants. 

Typically, the objective of the contest designer is to maximize the quality and probability of a successful innovation while minimizing the time it takes to complete the project. Striking a balance between these two desirable but incompatible features it is often difficult. The lack of knowledge about the individual costs and technical feasibility of the innovation may force contest designers to make tough choices under considerable uncertainty. A growing literature on contest design offers insights on how to make better choices. However, while researchers have examined various aspects of the management of this trade-off,  the optimal design remains a wide open issue. 

Our contribution here is to focus on one key factor of design that is the choice of the way participants compete.  In general, there are two extreme forms of competition. One is the _race_ where the first to finish the innovation project wins. The second is the _tournament_ where the best to finish the project within a given unit of time wins. To fix ideas, imagine a government designing an innovation contest to find a solution to a threat to the public health, such as the UK government with respect to the problem of antibiotic resistance.^[This example is taken...] To minimize the risks that the threat will materialize before a solution is actually found, one option is to design a contest with a tight deadline after which the government will rank order the received solutions and pick the most effective one, awarding a prize to the winners. Alternatively, the government can design a contest with a minimum desired effectiveness threshold and award a prize to the first solution that achieves or goes beyond the threshold. For a given prize amount, both approaches have specific advantages and limitations. If the prize to time ratio is too low, incentives in the tournament competition may not deliver high quality solutions. At the same time, in a race, participants have no incentives to exceed the threshold. Understing the conditions to choose one competition or the other is the main objective of this paper.
 
In this study, we design and execute a field experiment to compare behavior in a race and a tournament setting. We proceed in two ways. First, we generalize an incomplete information contest model [@moldovanu2001optimal] to enable a direct comparison of equilibrium behaviors under both the race and the tournament within a single theoretical framework. Then, we collect data from a field experiment to test some of the implications of the theory, and provide policy recommendations. 


The field experiment was conducted xxxx. We worked together with researchers from the United States National Health Institute (NIH) and the Scripps Research Institute (SCRIPPS) to select a challenging problem for the contest. The selected problem was based on an algorithm called BANNER built by NIH [@leaman2008banner] that uses expert labeling to annotate abstracts from a prominent life sciences and biomedical search engine, PubMed, so disease characteristics can be more easily identified. The goal of the programming competition was to improve upon the current NIH's system by using a combination of expert and non-expert labeling, as described by @good2014microtask. The competition was hosted online on the platform Topcoder.com (about 1M registered users in 2016). Submissions were made online. The top submissions were awarded a monetary prize ranging between $5000 to $100 for a total prize pool of $40,000.


Competitors were randomly assigned to virtual rooms of 10 or 15 people. These virtual rooms were then randomly assigned to one of three different competitive settings: a race, a tournament, and a tournament with a "reserve score," which is the lowest acceptable by the platform for a submission to be awarded a prize.

We find that xxxxx  participation in the tournament is xxx compared to the race the reserve. 
 
We also find that xxxx submission are quicker in a race, whereas are equally distributed at the end of the competition in the the tournament and in the tournament with quality requirement. 

Another interesting finding is that xxxxx No evidence trade-off between a race and a tournament in terms of higher scores vs faster submissions. We do find that scores are higher in the tournament but we do not find a strong trade-off in the sense that race had comparable good quality solutions than the tournament.

An extensive literature has indicated the main theoretical reasons why contests are to be preferred to other forms of incentives. Typically, contests reduce monitoring costs [xxx], incentivize production with common risks [xxx], and deal with indivisible rewards [xxxx], among others. Much work has been done investigating several aspects of contest design, including the optimal prize structure [XXX, xxxx, xxxx], number of competitors [XXX, XXX], and imposing restrictions to competition such as minimum effort requirements [XXX, XXX]. 


Also, a great deal of theoretical models of races and tournaments have been developed and applied to a wide range of economic situations including patent races, arms races, sports, the mechanism of promotions inside firms, sales tournaments, xxx, and xxxx.  A typical finding is that contests may lead to over-expenditure of effort with participants exerting more effort than the value of the prize. This problem happens when the contest designer does not capture the entire aggregate efforts which exceeds the value of the prize. In an innovation contest,  xxxx we do not care. Another problem is that of a misallocation of the prize. This happens when participants have different evaluation for winning the prize and the contest is not xxxx (perfect discrimination). These issues have been discussed in the past. Here we take the perspective of the principal. Leaving aside misallocation, over-expenditure can be an issue also for the contest designer. For example, a manager care about the effort wasted xxxx working on a problem. Part is also with respect to the time spent, assuming workers can process one task at a time. 


3.1.1 Excess of effort
3.1.2 Excess of participation


The dynamics. @harris1987racing, @grossman1987dynamic are classical models of dynamic patent races where the interest is how firms compete for a patent. @bimpikis2014designing looks at the problem of how to design an information structure that is optimal when the contest is a race and innovation is uncertain (encouragement and competition effect). In the laboratory, @zizzo2002racing finds poor support to predictions of dynamic xxxx. In general we do not know much about the dynamic aspect of contests. 


3.2 Duality

The duality. As pointed out by @baye2003strategic, many of these models of  tournament and  race competitions are specific cases of a more general "contest games." And sometimes it is possible to design one or the other in a way to exploit a "duality." In other words, in theory, a competition can be designed as a tournament to do xxx or as a race to do xxx. While theoretically very useful, how to exploit this duality in practice  remains largely unknown. Lack of data. As before, xxxx. The main challenge is self-selection.   The answer to this optimal design question relates to the cost function of agents with respect to "time" and to "effort." It is hard to say which solution is better. However, it is easier to tell whether you should have one prize or multiple prizes. 


<!-- 
By this perspective, we are able to show that races cannot be justified simply by the goal of maximizing average effort. And the reason is intuitive. A race awards a prize to first to hit a particular target. Those who will judge the target to hard to achieve will not join the competition and will drop out. On the contrary,  those who are able to achieve the target at low costs will not try to exceed the target. As a result, the race is comparable to a competition with fixed "entry costs" or a fixed entry requirement, where agents will decide to either enter and pay a fixed prize, or stay out of the competition. Then, the possible gains in terms of expected revenues from a race are limited to those who would enter the competition and would exert less effort that that required to hit the target. These potential benefits can be obtained under a tournament as well by imposing a a fixed requirement to be eligible for prizes. So, races are not chosen to maximize expected effort of competitors, at least, in the traditional "auction-theoretical" sense.

In a tournament, this type of preferences can be satisfied by fixing a deadline. Say time within which competitors are asked to provide their efforts. However, assuming competitors have costs from making less time in performing a task and there complementarities in costs, increasing the deadline in a tournament is similar to raising the marginal cost for everyone, which might not be an optimal solution. In a race, by contrast, increasing the deadline will affect entry but, conditional on entry, the time to complete the task will always be less than the deadline. Which means that those with low costs will be mostly affected by the deadline, whereas xxxx.  Which may be a superior choice than the tournament.

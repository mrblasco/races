The model
=========

We now generalize the contest game introduced by @moldovanu2001optimal to a situation where players simultaneously decide $i)$ the quality and $ii)$ how fast to produce a given output. Then we explore the problem of revenue maximization faced by a contest designer with preferences for both quality and time.

Basic setup
-----------

Consider a contest game in which there are $i=1,..., n$ players willing to compete for $k=1, ..., q$ prizes of decreasing value $v_1\geq v_2\geq ...\geq v_q\geq0$. Players simultaneously decide how much quality $y_i$ and how much time $t_i$ they spend in a given production task. This decision dictates the cost they incur and the probability of winning a prize.

The cost is determined by a function $C(\cdot)$ that is increasing in $q_i$, decreasing in $t_i$, and varies based upon an individual ability $a_i$ which is meant to reflect differences in skills, time constraints, and other elements affecting quality and time in production. The cost function is assumed to have the following (Cobb-Douglas) form: 

\begin{equation}
	C(a, y, t) = a^\alpha y^\beta t^\gamma
\end{equation}

with $\alpha, \gamma < 0$ and $\beta>1$. Thus, the higher the quality over time ratio (the "speed") or the lower the level of individual ability, the higher will be the production costs incurred by players.

There is asymmetric information about the cost parameters. While players know their own ability, they are not aware of the ability of the other players. It is, however, common knowledge that abilities are drawn at random from a common cumulative distribution function $F(\cdot)$ with density $f(\cdot)$ on a bounded interval $[\lotype, \hitype]$ with $\lotype>0$.

Based on this information, players maximize the following expected payoff:

\begin{equation} 
	\label{expected payoff}
	\pi_i = \sum_{k=1}^{q} p_{k}(y_i, t_i) v_k - C(a_i, y_i, t_i)
\end{equation}

where $p_{k}(\cdot)$ denotes the conditional probability of winning a prize given player $i$'s quality $y_i$ and time $t_i$.

We further consider two general limitations to competition regarding time ("deadlines") and quality (minimum-quality "targets"). In a contest where players have to meet a fixed deadline $\deadline$ to be elegible for prizes, the conditional probability of winning a prize is zero when $t_i> \deadline$. In a contest where players have to achieve a minimum-quality target $\target$ to be elegible for prizes, the conditional probability of winning a prize is zero when $y_i < \target$. 

And we examine two types of competition: the tournament and the race.

A tournament competition is a contest with a deadline (and possibly a minimum-quality target) where the player having achieved the highest quality before the deadline gets the first prize, the player having achieved the second highest output quality before the deadline gets the second prize, and so on. Let denote the $k$'th smallest of the $y_i$'s by $y_{k, n}$ ($y_{1, n}$ being the smallest, $y_{2, n}$ being the second smallest, and so on) with the convention that, when a player passed the deadline, the corresponding quality is zero. Then, player $i$'s conditional probability of winning the first prize is:

\begin{equation}
	p^{T}_{1}(y_i, t_i) = \Pr(y_i \geq y_{n-1:n-1})
\end{equation}

when $t_i\leq\deadline$, and is zero otherwise; the conditional probability of winning the second prize is:^[Here we use the fact that individual choices are simultaneous and, therefore, independent.]

\begin{equation}
	p^{T}_{2}(y_i, t_i) =  [1 - \Pr(y_i \geq y_{n-1:n-1})]  \Pr(y_i \geq y_{n-2:n-2})
\end{equation}

when $t_i\leq \deadline$, and is zero otherwise; and so on.

A race competition is a contest with minimum-quality target $\target$ where the first player to achieve a given minimum quality target $\target$ gets the first prize, the player being the second to achieve the target gets the second prize, and so on. Let denote the $k$'th smallest of the $t_i$'s by $t_{k, n}$ ($t_{1, n}$ being the smallest, $t_{2, n}$ being the second smallest, and so on). Player $i$'s conditional probability of winning a first prize in a race is:

\begin{equation}
	p^{R}_{1}(y_i, t_i) = \Pr(t_i \leq t_{n-1:n-1})
\end{equation}
 
when $t_i\leq \deadline$ and $y_i \geq \target$, and is zero otherwise.

In other words, races and tournaments are a special case of a general contest game but with different probabilities of winning. 


Let denote the actions of the winner of the contest by the vector $(y^w, t^w)$.  From the point of view of the contest designer, the expected payoff (net of payments) is:

\[
	R = E[y^w] - \tau E[t^w]
\]

where $\tau$ denotes the contest designer's preference for expected time of the output (e.g., in a tournament is the deadline). 



Equilibrium
-------------

In this section, we solve the model for the unique symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium of players. 

<!--- 
We assume throughout that there are only two prizes of total value normalized to one, where the fraction $\alpha\geq 1/2$ goes to the first placed competitor and $1-\alpha$ goes to the second placed competitor. We also let $F_{r:n}$ and $f_{r:n}$ be the distribution and density function of the $r^{th}$ order statistic (i.e., the $r^{th}$ lowest realization) of $n$ draws from the ability distribution (i.e., the $a$'s).
--> 

### Tournament

At equilibrium, each player $i$ chooses $y_i$ and $t_i$ by maximizing $\pi_i$ give their beliefs about the equilibrium actions of the players.

Here, the key observation is that, for a given level of quality, any time that is strictly below the deadline does not affect the probability of winning but is costly in terms of effort (working faster is costlier) and any time that is strictly above the deadline gives a negative payoff. Thus, choosing  $t_i=\deadline$ is a (weakly) dominant strategy for each player. Then the first order condition with respect to quality is:

\[
	\sum_{k=1}^{q} \hat p^{\prime}_{k}(y_i) v_k = \cability(a_i) \cscore^\prime(y_i) \ctime(\deadline).
\]

where $\hat p = p(\cdot, \deadline).$ Then it can be show that xxxx. 


<!---
 also means that, from the point of view of the contest designer, imposing a more distant deadline has the same effect as a reduction in the marginal costs for every participant competitor. [This should go later] Then, the equilibrium $y_i$ must xxx a monotonic function $y^*()$ with an inverse $\phi()$ which satisfies the first-order differential equation
-->

\begin{align}
0 = & \alpha f_{(1:N-1)}(\phi) \phi^{\prime} 
	+ (1-\alpha)\phi^{\prime}\{[1 - F_{(1:N-1)}(\phi)]f_{(1:N-2)}(\phi) + \nonumber\\
    & + f_{(1:N-1)}(\phi) F_{(1:N-2)}(\phi)\} 
    - c_{a}(a) c_{y}(\target) \ctime^{\prime}(t_i)
\end{align}

subject to the boundary condition  $\phi(0) = \lotype$ (i.e., the lowest-ability competitor's optimal output quality is zero). 

As shown by @moldovanu2001optimal, the solution is 

\begin{equation} \label{ystar}
y^*(a_i) = 
	\cscore^{-1}
	\left[\cscore(\target) 
	+ \frac{1}{\ctime(\deadline)}
	\left(\alpha \int_{a_i}^{\hitype} A(z) dz
	  + (1-\alpha) \int_{a_i}^{\hitype} B(z)  dz
	\right)
	\right]
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  A(x) = \frac{1}{c_{a}(x)} f_{(n-1:n-1)}(x)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  B(x) = \frac{1}{c_{a}(x)} \left\{
      \left[1- F_{(n-1:n-1)}(x)\right]f_{(n-1:n-2)}(x)
      + f_{(n-1:n-1)}(x) F_{(n-1:n-2)}(x)
    \right\}.
\end{equation}
 
Monotonicity of the equilibrium output quality implies that, for every $i=1, ..., n$, the equilibrium expected payoff from the contest $\pi_i^*$ depends on the rank of the player's ability relative to the others. As a result, the equilibrium expected payoff net of costs is
\begin{equation} 
	R(a_i) = \alpha F_{n:n}(a_i) + (1-\alpha)[1-F_{n:n}(a_i)] F_{n-1:n-1}(a_i).
\end{equation} % payoffs


### Equilibrium in a race

In a similar way, one can derive the equilibrium strategy in a race. Again the key observation is that any quality below the target gives a zero probability of winning and any quality  above the target gives a constant probability of winning. Thus, player $i$'s choice of optimal quality $y^*$ is either zero (with $t_i=\deadline$ by convention) or $y^*=\target$.

Then, the equilibrium xxx for player $i$ is 
\begin{equation} \label{tstar}
t^*(a_i) = 
	\ctime^{-1}
	\left[\ctime(\deadline) 
	+ \frac{1}{\cscore(\target)}
	\left(\alpha \int_{a_i}^{\hitype} A^\prime(z) dz
	  + (1-\alpha) \int_{a_i}^{\hitype} B^\prime(z)  dz
	\right)
	\right]
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  A(x) = \frac{1}{c_{a}(x)} f_{(n-1:n-1)}(x)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	B(x) = \frac{1}{c_{a}(x)} \left\{
      		\left[1- F_{(n-1:n-1)}(x)\right]f_{(n-1:n-2)}(x)
      		+ f_{(n-1:n-1)}(x) F_{(n-1:n-2)}(x)
    \right\}.
\end{equation}

An important property of XX is that $y^*(a_i)$ has its upper bound in XX and
lower bound in XX. Again payoffs are xxxx. Hence, by setting to zero and solving for the ability, gives the marginal ability ${\underline a}$ as
\begin{equation}
  {\underline a}= h(n, V, F_A, C, d).
\end{equation}

### Tournament vs races

By comparing equilibrium xxx and xxx, we find that the race and the tournament do not (ex-post) dominate one another with respect to output quality. Whereas the race always dominates the tournament with respect to completion time. [This is only when the deadline is the same. Otherwise, there's always xxxx.] This result is stated below.

\begin{proposition}
There always exist an interval of abilities where the output quality is higher in the race than in the tournament. By contrast, every player takes less completion time in the race than in the tournament.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Marginal type has utility zero in a race but the same type has a strictly positive utility in the tournament. Since probability of winning is not different in the race or the tournament (the bid is a monotonic transformation of the individual ability or, in other words, rankings are virtually the same), expected payoffs in equilibrium differ only in the cost functions. Hence, to be an equilibrium, the player in the tournament should bid less than the player in the race to earn a strictly positive expected payoff. 
\end{proof}

Let's make an example.  
```
p <- plnorm   # pdf individual abilities 
r <- rlnorm   # Simulate individual abilities
cy <- function(x) x^2 # Cost function performance
ct <- function(x) 2*exp(1-x)  # Cost function timing 
```
FIGURE 1. Equilibrium bids in a race and a tournament. 


Implications. The above proposition applies only if the target is higher in a race than in a tournament. But what if the two competitions had the same target ? In that case, tournaments and races have the same marginal type. Therefore, the performance of players in the tournament with reserve are always non-lower than those in the race. This does not imply that it is optimal to set the target. On the contrary, we will show that it is optimal to set an optimal target in a tournament that is below the optimal target in a race. Next section.  


The contest designer's problem
---------------------------

Let us now focus on the contest designer's problem. Imagine the contest designer can choose the competition format to be either the race or the tournament. Imagine all other aspects of design are given. The prize structure $\alpha$ has been already chosen. There is a deadline $\deadline$, which is the same in both competition formats. [The quality requirement $\target_c$ in the tournament  is smalle than that in the race $\target_\race > \target_\tournament$)] We will relax this assumption later to consider a more general setting where these variables are also part of the contest designer's problem.

The contest designer has an objective function that is increasing in the expected quality of the winning solution and decreasing in the corresponding time to completion. Here, to do not complicate exposition, we assume that the contest designer cares about the winning submission only: second placed efforts are not considered. [If the principal values the diversity of the solutions ... but we assume it does not.]


XXX EQUATION XXXX

The optimal choice involves a comparison of the expected profits between the race and the tournament. Given xxxx, we can show that there will be a threshold on the cost of completion time $\hat\tau$ above which the race is a better choice than the tournament, and vice versa.

\begin{proposition}
There's a tau above which ... 
\end{proposition}

Proof.  In a tournament, the objective function is 
\begin{align}
R_\tournament & = \Pr(t_{(1:n)}\leq \deadline) \left\{\int y^*(x \mid t_{(1:n)}\leq \deadline) dF_{n:n}(x) - \tau \deadline - 1 \right\}  \nonumber\\
  & = \int_{\mtype}^{\hitype} y^*(x) dF_{n:n}(x) - \tau \deadline - 1. 
\end{align}

That is, the contest designer's objective function is the sum of the expected output quality for a given deadline, minus the cost $\tau$ of having the winner working on the task until completion (i.e., until the deadline), and the cost of the prize pool (recall the prize pool is normalized to one). 

[Implicitly, you're assuming that the prize is always large enough to ensure positive effort.] [Second prize too is stochastic!!!!]

In a race, the objective function is
\begin{align}
R_\race & =  
  \Pr(a_{(N)}\geq \mtype) \left\{\target - \alpha -
  \Pr(a_{(N-1)}\geq \mtype) (1-\alpha) \right\}
  - \tau \int_{\mtype}^{\infty} t^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) \nonumber\\
  & = [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] \left\{\target - \alpha -
  [1-F_{N-1:N}(\mtype)] (1 - \alpha) \right\}
  - \tau \int_{\mtype}^{\infty} t^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x).
\end{align}


Note. $t^*(x) \leq \deadline$ for all $x$'s. Thus, a lower bound for the above objective function can be computed: 
\begin{align}
\underline {R_\race} & = 
  [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] \left\{\target - \alpha -
  [1-F_{N-1:N}(\mtype)] (1 - \alpha) - \tau \deadline\right\}
\end{align}
An even simpler lower bound is rewriting the above expression as if $\alpha=1$ (note if the real alpha was set 1 then also mtype would change and therefore setting alpha hits a lower bound only when mtype does xxxx  when alpha is 1). 
 
Note. $y^*(x)$ is lower than $\target$ for all $a < \mtype$. Thus, a lower bound of the tournament's expression is
\begin{align}
\overline {R_\tournament} & = 
  [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] \target + \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) 
  - \tau \deadline - 1. 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \underline {R_\race} \geq & \overline {R_\tournament} \nonumber\\
  [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] (\target - 1 - \tau \deadline) \geq &
  [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] \target + \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) 
  - \tau \deadline - 1 \nonumber\\
  - [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] (\tau\deadline + 1) \geq &
  \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) 
  - (\tau \deadline + 1) \nonumber\\
  F_{N:N}(\mtype) (\tau \deadline + 1) \geq &
  \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x) \nonumber\\
  \tau \geq & 
    \left[
      \frac{\int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x) dF_{N:N}(x)}{F_{N:N}(\mtype)} -1 
    \right] \frac{1}{\deadline}
\end{align}

End proof.

When the cost of time $\tau$ is sufficiently high, the race is preferred. Interestingly, the threshold is a function of the deadline to complete the job, as xxx. It also depends on the shape of xxxx. 

### Optimal minimum-entry

Now we turn to discuss the contest designer's choice of an optimal minimum requirement $\target$. So far, we have assumed that $\target_\race>\target_\tournament$. Now, we show that the assumption that xxxx is indeed an optimal choice of the contest designer. This is summarized in the next proposition.

\begin{proposition}
Suppose the contest designer can choose the target that max profits in both the race and the tournament. Then, the optimal $\target$ in tournament is generally lower than that in a race.
\end{proposition}

To prove that it is indeed the case. We proceed in two steps. First, we assume that the contest designer does not care about minimizing the timing of the innovation by imposing $\tau = 0$. For simplicity, assume that $\alpha=1$ (winner-takes-all). In a race, this means that the optimal target will be a value that makes equal the costs in terms of less participation versus the gains in terms of higher values of the winning solutions. Formally, the contest designer's problem in a race is
\begin{align}
  \text{maximize } & R^\race = [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] (\target_\race - 1).
\end{align}
Note that $\mtype$ depends on the target. This is clearly concave in $\target_\race$. 
Thus, the first order condition is also sufficient. 
\begin{align}\label{foc race}
  \text{FOC } & \Rightarrow -F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) \mtype^\prime (\target_\race - 1) + [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)] = 0.
\end{align}

In a tournament, ... 
\begin{align}
  \text{maximize } & R^\race = \int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x, \target) d F_{N:N}(x) - [1-F_{N:N}(\mtype)]. 
\end{align}
Convexity is not sure. If not, then the optimal target is zero. Which is lower than the optimal target in a race. 

Instead. If the objective function is (strictly) concave then there's an internal solution. 

\begin{align} \label{foc tournament}
  \text{FOC } \Rightarrow & 
    \frac{d\int_{\mtype}^\infty y^*(x, \target) d F_{N:N}(x)) }{d \target}
      + F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) \mtype^\prime =0 \nonumber\\ 
    & \text{(by using Leibniz rule)}\nonumber\\
  \Rightarrow & - y^*(\mtype, \target) \mtype^\prime F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) 
      + \int_{\mtype}^\infty \dystar - F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) \mtype^\prime = 0\nonumber\\
  \Rightarrow & -\target \mtype^\prime F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) 
      + \int_{\mtype}^\infty \dystar - F^\prime_{N:N}(\mtype) \mtype^\prime = 0.
\end{align}

Using \eqref{foc race} with \eqref{foc tournament}, the optimal target is the same in the race and the tournament only if
\begin{align} 
  \int_{\mtype}^\infty \dystar = [1- F_{N:N}(\mtype)].
\end{align}

\[
  \frac{\partial y^*(x, \target)}{\partial \target} = 
    \frac{c_y^\prime(\target)}{c_y^\prime(y^*(x, \target))}. 
\]

Then. 

- If $c_y(\cdot)$ is linear, we have that the ratio is one for all $x$. 

- If $c_y(\cdot)$ is convex, then we have that it is less than one. If 

- If $c_y(\cdot)$ is concave, then we have that it is higher than one.

As a result, if linear or convex the first order condition is lower than that in the race. Since the obj. function is concave (second order is decreasing), the target should be lower in a tournament than in a race to satisfy the first order condition.  (a lower target increases the focs.).

Conjecture. If $\tau>0$, the $\target$ in the race is higher.

General two-step strategy:

- First step. Identify the marginal type from the data and the distribution of types. 

- Second step. Using the estimated distribution of types. 


Basic idea. Equilibrium condition gives:
\begin{equation}
  y_i^* = y^*(a_i; F_{\mathcal{A}}). 
\end{equation}
with $y^*(\cdot)$ being an invertible function with $\phi$ denoting the inverse.

Hence the distribution of bids is
\begin{equation}
F_{Y}(y) = \Pr(y_i^* \leq y) 
        = \Pr(y^*(a_i) \leq y) 
        = \Pr(a_i \leq \phi(y)) 
        = F_\mathcal{A}( \phi(y)).
\end{equation}

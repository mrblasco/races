The model
==============

We generalize the contest game described by @moldovanu2001optimal to a situation where $N$ players decide how much effort to provide along two dimensions: performance and time.  The contest game is an N player game with asymmetric information. Players move simultaneously to maximize the expected utility. Each player $i=1, 2, ..., N$ selects a performance variable $y_i$ and a timing $t_i$, both being nonnegative numbers. These variables can be thought of as the accuracy of a solution to a given problem and the time to write the code implementing such solution. Players incur a cost from effort given by the function
\begin{equation}
  C_i(y_i, t_i) = \frac{1}{a_i} c(y_i, t_i)
\end{equation}
where the function $c(\cdot)$ is xxxx. The cost parameter $a_i$ denotes the player's ability, which is privately observed at the beginning of the game. It is common knowledge that abilities are drawn from a common distribution $F$ that is continuous on the semi-infinite interval $[0,\infty)$ (e.g., exponential).  

Let $r_i$ denote the rank position of a player $i$ relative to the $N-1$ others. The top $K$ players (e.g., $r_i\leq K$) are awarded a prize of value $V_1 > V_2 > ... > V_K$. A player's probability of winning a prize is given by the function $p_i(y_1,...y_N, t_1, ..., t_N)$. 


The goal for each player is If the timing is above a given deadline $d>0$ or the performance is below a certain level $q>0$, the player gets zero utility. Otherwise, the player is given a rank based on his performance and timing. 
 A contest is xxxx. Ranked . 

def: A tournament is a xxxx where players are ranked by their performance level provided that the timing is below a deadline $d$.

def: A race is a xxxx where players are ranked by their timing provided that the performance is above a threshold level $q$.  

In a tournament, the agent having achieved the highest output quality
within the deadline gets the first prize, the agent having achieved the
second highest output quality gets the second prize, and so on. In a
race, by contrast, the first agent to achieve an output quality of at
least ${\bar y}$ within the deadline wins the first prize, the second to
achieve the same target gets the second prize, and so on.

Since agents move simultaneously, they do not know the performance of
others when deciding their efforts. On the other hand, it is assumed
that they know the number of competitors as well as their cost functions
to complete the task up to a factor $a_i$ being the agent’s private
ability in performing the task. Each agent knows his ability but does
not know the ability of the others. However, it is common knowledge that
abilities are drawn at random from a common distribution $F_A$ that is
assumed everywhere differentiable on the support
$V\subseteq [0, \infty)$.

It is further assumed that costs are multiplicative

$$C(y_i, t_i, a_i) = {c_{y}}(y) \cdot {c_{t}}(t)  \cdot a_i^{-1}$$

with ${c_{y}}(0)\geq 0$, ${c_{y}}^\prime>0$, ${c_{t}}(d)\geq 0$, and
${c_{t}}^\prime<0$.

Each agent is risk neutral and faces the following decision problem

$$\begin{array}{ll}
    \mbox{maximize} & \sum_{j=1}^k \Pr(\text{ranked $j$'th}) V_j  - C(y_i, t_i, a_i).
  \end{array}$$

### Equilibrium

We provide here the symmetric equilibrium with one prize and $n>2$
agents. In appendix XXX, we provide a general formula for $k>2$ prizes.

Let $y_{1:n} < y_{2:n} < ... < y_{n:n}$ denote the order statistics of
the $y_j$’s for every $j\neq i$ and let ${F_{Y_{r:n}}}(\cdot)$ and
${f_{Y_{r:n}}}(\cdot)$ denote the corresponding distribution and density
for the $r$’th order statistic.

<div class='proposition'>

In a tournament, the unique symmetric equilibrium of the model gives,
for every $i=1, ..., n$, the optimal time to completion $t^*(a_i)$ equal
to the deadline $d$ and the optimal output quality $y^*(a_i)$ as

$$\label{eq: optimal bid tournament}
  y^*(a_i) =  V_1 \int_{a_i}^\infty {f_{Y_{n:n}}} (z) dz$$

if ${a_i}\geq {\underline a}$ [see @moldovanu2001optimal], and equal to
zero otherwise.

</div>

An important property of is that $y^*(a_i)$ has its upper bound in and
lower bound in . Also, equilibrium output quality is monotonic
increasing in the agent’s ability [see @moldovanu2001optimal]. Thus, for
every $i=1, ..., n+1$, the equilibrium expected reward depends only on
the rank of his ability relative to the others. Using ${F_{A_{r:n}}}$ to
denote the distribution of the $r$’th order statistic of abilities gives

$$\label{eq: expected payoffs tournament}
  {F_{A_{n:n}}}(a_i) V_1  - C(y_i^*, d, a_i).$$

Hence, by setting to zero and solving for the ability, gives the
marginal ability ${\underline a}$ as

$${\underline a}= h(n, V, F_A, C, d).$$

### Contest designer's problem

The sponsor of the contest chooses the rules of the competition
including prize structure $\{V_j\}_{j=1}^k$, deadline $d$, target
quality $q$, and competition format (race or tournament). The sponsor
maximizes an objective function that is the sum of total quality
$Y=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} Y_i$, time spent $T=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} T_i$ and prizes
paid $V=\sum_{j=1}^k p_{j} V_j$ (with $p_j=1$ if the prize is awarded
and $p_j=0$ otherwise). Hence, the problem faced by the sponsor is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
    \mbox{maximize} & \int {Y}   -  {\tau}{{\bf E}}{T} - {{\bf E}}{V}
  \end{array}$$

with the intensity of preferences towards time weighted by $c_t\geq 0$.

Introduction
============

Contests have had and continue to have a tremendous impact on economic growth. Historically, awards offered by government agencies have accelerated agricoltural innovation;^[@Brunt:2012ix shows how agricultural innovation in England went up due to the awards offered by the Royal Agricultural Society at the beginning of 20th century.] improved methods for navigation and cartography;^[A well known example is the Longitude rewards offered by the British government in 1714 that contributed to solve for the first time the problem of the precise determination of a ship's longitude at sea.] and kick-started the modern aviation sector.^[Historically, the Orteig Prize xxxx. More recently, X-Prize inspired by xxxx.] Today, in addition to government agencies, also philanthropic organizations and private firms recur to contests for numerous purposes that include incentivizing employees and crowdsourcing a long list of internal activities (marketing campaigns, data analysis, software development) to large online communities of freelancers.

While the economic relevance of contests is well recognized (xxxx), contest designer xxx have this problem xxx. How to do xxx? How to xxxx? In this paper, we compare two different choices of design. One is the "race" competition,  where prizes are offered to the competitor that _first_ reaches a fixed performance target. The other is the "tournament" competition, where prizes are offered to the competitor that does _best_ relative to others by a given deadline. Familiar examples of races are the Longitude rewards offered by the British government in 1714, the Orteig Prize in 1919, and, more recently, the Netflix prize in 2009; while most architectural competitions, the Golden Carrot Contest in 1992, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) series of Grand Challenges between 2004 and 2013, and the Progressive Insurance Automotive X-Prize in 2010 are all examples of tournaments.^[See Wikipedia article on "Inducement prize contest" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inducement_prize_contest) for a list of these contests with links to their descriptions. The Golden Carrot Contest has been described by @taylor1995digging.]

Races and tournaments are very general forms of competition. And an extensive literature exists that has focused on races, in the context of patent races, and tournaments separetely. With only a few papers in economics comparing race and tournament in a single framework. A underxxxx that is perhaps becayse in many situations the choice seem imposed by the environment (as in the case of the legal environment defining a patent race) rather than a straightforward choice of contest design. In addition, and from a contest design perspective, the choice between race and tournament competitions is difficult to examine: xxxx. A natural way to examine the issue is via modeling choices as a function of the contest sponsors's preferences towards two desirable, but often incompatible, goals: $i$) maximizing revenues through raising the efforts of competitors while $ii$) lowering the time it takes to complete a given job. It is unclear, however, how either two competition formats will solve this trade-off. On the one hand, a fixed deadline may accelerate production in tournaments. On the other, a too short deadline may deter entry, thereby lowering revenues from competitors effort. Likewise, a time competition may encourage competitors to reach a given target faster, but it may also limit competition if the target can be reached only by a few competitors. Alternatively, the choice between tournaments and races can be seen as the response to "efficiency" concerns of the contest sponsors. Under this view, races and tournaments may lead to the same expected outcomes in terms of time or effort but lead to different duplication costs by regulating "entry" into the contest [as discussed by Fullerton Mcafee, xxxx]. Hence, the "time preferences" story and the "efficiency" are two possible explanation for using a race or a contest. 


In this article, we investigate the choice between races and tournaments both theoretically, and empirically in the field.  We proceed in two ways. First, we develop a contest model that encompasses both the race and the tournament in a single framework. Exploring the duality of the model, we compare equilibrium behaviors under both competitive formats and characterize the optimal choice for the contest designer. Then, we design and execute an experiment to test the implications of the theory in the field, and xxxx  providing policy recommendations. 

Our theoritical approach extends the contest model introduced by @moldovanu2001optimal to a situation in which xxx decide both time and quality. Thus, contests have an all-pay structure by which participants pay an immediate cost for an uncertain future reward. The decision of timing and quality is made under the uncertainty of the costs of the rivals. The contest designer wants to maximize reveues and has preferences for both time and quality. Following the analysis of the model, we show that the optimal design depends on the number of participants and the concavity of their cost function.  We also show that XXX, YYY, and ZZZZ. 


To fix ideas, imagine a government willing to design an innovation contest aimed at finding solutions to a problem of public health, such as antibiotic resistance.^[This example is taken...] To minimize the risk that the threat of xxxx will materialize before a solution is found, one may choose a tournament competition format with a tight deadline for participants to provide their solutions. The problem is to find the right duration. When the duration of the competition is too short, incentives maybe insufficents for competitors to exert enough effort resulting in inadequate solutions. Alternatively, the government can set up a race competition with a prize being awarded to the first competitor who achieves, or goes beyond, a minimum quality threshold. Here the problem of accelarating the timing of innovation should not be a big issue but competitors may work inefficiently, as they have no incentives to exceed the minimum threshold.  Fixed the prize structure, both approaches have specific advantages and limitations. However, xxxx. 


The context of the field experiment was an online programming competition run on Topcoder at the end of 2016. In a typical programming competition, participants compete writing source code that solves a given problem for winning a monetary prize. We worked together with researchers from the United States National Health Institute (NIH) and the Scripps Research Institute (SCRIPPS) to select a challenging problem for the contest. The selected problem was based on an algorithm called BANNER built by NIH [@leaman2008banner] that uses expert labeling to annotate abstracts from a prominent life sciences and biomedical search engine, PubMed, so disease characteristics can be more easily identified. The goal of the programming competition was to improve upon the current NIH's system by using a combination of expert and non-expert labeling, as described by @good2014microtask. The competition was hosted online on the platform Topcoder.com (about 1M registered users in 2016). Top submissions were awarded monetary prizes ranging between $100 to $5000 for a total prize pool of more than $40,000.

Our intervention consisted in sorting at random participants into independent virtual rooms of 10 or 15 people. These virtual rooms were then randomly assigned to one of three different competitive settings: a race, a tournament, and a tournament with a reserve score, which is the lowest acceptable score by the platform for a submission to be awarded a prize. 

We find that xxxxx [participation in the tournament is xxx compared to the race the reserve.]
 
We also find that xxxx [submission are quicker in a race, whereas are equally distributed at the end of the competition in the the tournament and in the tournament with quality requirement.]

Another interesting finding is that xxxxx [No evidence trade-off between a race and a tournament in terms of higher scores vs faster submissions. We do find that scores are higher in the tournament but we do not find a strong trade-off in the sense that race had comparable good quality solutions than the tournament.]

An extensive literature has discussed the reasons why contests are sometimes preferred to other forms of incentives (e.g., individual contracts). Typically, contests reduce monitoring costs [xxx], incentivize production with common risks [xxx], and deal with indivisible rewards [xxxx], among others. While there is not much debate on why contests should be used, the issue of how to effectively design and deploy a contest still attracts much research. 

Several aspects of contest design have been investigated, including the optimal prize structure [XXX, xxxx, xxxx], number of competitors [XXX, XXX], and imposing restrictions to competition such as minimum effort requirements [XXX, XXX]. Also, a great deal of theoretical models of races and tournaments have been developed and applied to a wide range of economic situations including patent races [xxx], arms races [xxx], sports [xxx], the mechanism of promotions inside firms [xxxx], sales tournaments [xxxx], etc.

@harris1987racing, @grossman1987dynamic investigate the dynamics issues patent races where the interest is how firms compete for a patent. @bimpikis2014designing looks at the problem of how to design an information structure that is optimal when the contest is a race and innovation is uncertain (encouragement and competition effect). In the laboratory, @zizzo2002racing finds poor support to predictions of dynamic xxxx. In general we do not know much about the dynamic aspect of contests. 

The duality. As pointed out by @baye2003strategic, many of these models of  tournament and  race competitions are specific cases of a more general "contest games." And sometimes it is possible to design one or the other in a way to exploit a "duality." In other words, in theory, a competition can be designed as a tournament to do xxx or as a race to do xxx. While theoretically very useful, how to exploit this duality in practice  remains largely unknown. Lack of data. As before, xxxx. The main challenge is self-selection.   The answer to this optimal design question relates to the cost function of agents with respect to "time" and to "effort." It is hard to say which solution is better. However, it is easier to tell whether you should have one prize or multiple prizes. 


<!-- Part of the literature has been focused on the issue of economic efficiency [xxxx]. A typical finding is that contests may lead to over-expenditure of effort with participants exerting more effort than the value of the prize. This problem happens when the contest designer does not capture the entire aggregate efforts which exceeds the value of the prize. When participants have heterogeneous preferences an additional problem is that of a misallocation of the prize [xxxx]. Both isses  [we do not care.]  -->


<!-- 
By this perspective, we are able to show that races cannot be justified simply by the goal of maximizing average effort. And the reason is intuitive. A race awards a prize to first to hit a particular target. Those who will judge the target to hard to achieve will not join the competition and will drop out. On the contrary,  those who are able to achieve the target at low costs will not try to exceed the target. As a result, the race is comparable to a competition with fixed "entry costs" or a fixed entry requirement, where agents will decide to either enter and pay a fixed prize, or stay out of the competition. Then, the possible gains in terms of expected revenues from a race are limited to those who would enter the competition and would exert less effort that that required to hit the target. These potential benefits can be obtained under a tournament as well by imposing a a fixed requirement to be eligible for prizes. So, races are not chosen to maximize expected effort of competitors, at least, in the traditional "auction-theoretical" sense.

<!-- 
In a tournament, this type of preferences can be satisfied by fixing a deadline. Say time within which competitors are asked to provide their efforts. However, assuming competitors have costs from making less time in performing a task and there complementarities in costs, increasing the deadline in a tournament is similar to raising the marginal cost for everyone, which might not be an optimal solution. In a race, by contrast, increasing the deadline will affect entry but, conditional on entry, the time to complete the task will always be less than the deadline. Which means that those with low costs will be mostly affected by the deadline, whereas xxxx.  Which may be a superior choice than the tournament.
